00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
back of our transmitter so that's how

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.170 
back of our transmitter so that's how
the<00:01:08.909> camera<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.270> getting<00:01:09.479> power

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
the camera is getting power

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
the camera is getting power
we're<00:01:12.180> also<00:01:12.330> looping<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
we're also looping out of that at the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
we're also looping out of that at the
DTaP<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> V<00:01:15.119> lock<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.659> could<00:01:15.780> also

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
DTaP of the V lock and this could also

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
DTaP of the V lock and this could also
be<00:01:16.080> an<00:01:16.229> hour<00:01:16.710> depending<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.909> our

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
be an hour depending on what our

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
be an hour depending on what our
batteries<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.479> using<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.920> power<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
batteries are using and that power is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
batteries are using and that power is
coming<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> actually<00:01:21.570> feeding<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
coming out and actually feeding the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
coming out and actually feeding the
tally<00:01:22.320> light<00:01:22.500> system<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.030> case<00:01:24.270> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
tally light system which in this case is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.020 
tally light system which in this case is
being<00:01:24.630> stuck<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> back<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> camera

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
being stuck on the back of the camera

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
being stuck on the back of the camera
the<00:01:27.030> reason<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.250> John

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the reason for this is because John

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
the reason for this is because John
Clarke<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> Steadicam<00:01:30.360> operator<00:01:30.740> actually

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
Clarke the Steadicam operator actually

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
Clarke the Steadicam operator actually
has<00:01:31.860> his<00:01:31.950> own<00:01:32.100> internal<00:01:32.610> tally<00:01:32.850> system<00:01:33.150> within

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
has his own internal tally system within

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.380 
has his own internal tally system within
the<00:01:34.020> city<00:01:34.229> cam<00:01:34.439> rig<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.520> he's<00:01:35.729> able<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> tap

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the city cam rig and so he's able to tap

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
the city cam rig and so he's able to tap
out<00:01:36.689> about<00:01:37.189> our<00:01:38.189> tally<00:01:38.490> system<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.000> this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
out about our tally system with this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
out about our tally system with this
cable<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.770> gets<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> into

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
cable here and then that gets it into

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.670 
cable here and then that gets it into
his<00:01:41.369> into<00:01:42.119> his<00:01:42.240> own<00:01:42.329> regen<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.930> sorts<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.590> his

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
his into his own regen he sorts out his

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.679 
his into his own regen he sorts out his
tally<00:01:43.920> from<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.310> point<00:01:44.490> onwards<00:01:44.880> normally

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
tally from that point onwards normally

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
tally from that point onwards normally
this<00:01:45.869> box<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.500> probably<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.860> stuck<00:01:47.130> on

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
this box here would probably be stuck on

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.980 
this box here would probably be stuck on
to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> front<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> lens<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.780> top<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to the front of the lens or on top of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.580 
to the front of the lens or on top of
the<00:01:49.170> camera<00:01:49.850> there's<00:01:50.850> actually<00:01:51.299> four<00:01:51.570> LEDs<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the camera there's actually four LEDs a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.230 
the camera there's actually four LEDs a
super-bright<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.640> front<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.060> then

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
super-bright for the front and then

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.740 
super-bright for the front and then
Red's<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> left<00:01:54.990> top<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
Red's for the left top and right and so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
Red's for the left top and right and so
that<00:01:57.899> gives<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.229> gives<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> reader<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that gives the gives the reader the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.560 
that gives the gives the reader the
tally<00:02:00.090> tally<00:02:00.990> system<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> that's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
tally tally system so that's the that's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.120 
tally tally system so that's the that's
the<00:02:03.689> main<00:02:03.840> transmitter<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> tele<00:02:04.799> system

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the main transmitter and the tele system

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.770 
of that unit is a full sorry 8 pin
Carosi<00:02:49.659> which<00:02:50.439> comes<00:02:50.709> out<00:02:50.889> of<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.780> goes

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
Carosi which comes out of there and goes

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.699 
Carosi which comes out of there and goes
into<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.230> remote<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:55.689> camera

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
into the remote of the camera

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.879 
into the remote of the camera
you<00:02:57.669> can<00:02:57.819> just<00:02:57.969> see<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.709> an<00:02:59.799> 8

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
you can just see there and that's an 8

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.319 
you can just see there and that's an 8
pin<00:03:00.069> heroes<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.609> back<00:03:00.760> there<00:03:00.939> so<00:03:01.120> it's<00:03:01.239> a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
pin heroes in the back there so it's a

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.439 
pin heroes in the back there so it's a
pin<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.659> pin<00:03:01.959> cable<00:03:02.609> that<00:03:03.609> also<00:03:03.909> gets<00:03:04.150> power

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:04.449 
pin to a pin cable that also gets power

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.879 
pin to a pin cable that also gets power
out<00:03:04.719> of<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.930> cable<00:03:05.109> as<00:03:05.319> well<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.799> don't

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
out of that cable as well so you don't

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.069 
out of that cable as well so you don't
actually<00:03:06.099> need<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.459> power<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.689> gets<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
actually need to power that it gets the

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.199 
actually need to power that it gets the
power<00:03:08.319> from<00:03:08.469> its<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.739> pin<00:03:09.010> straight<00:03:09.879> from<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
power from its a pin straight from the

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.209 
power from its a pin straight from the
back<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:11.019> connector<00:03:11.530> on<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.949> on<00:03:12.129> the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.219 
back of the connector on the on the

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.379 
back of the connector on the on the
camera<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:14.260> antenna<00:03:14.590> setups<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.489> usually

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
camera the antenna setups I usually

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.670 
camera the antenna setups I usually
break<00:03:16.479> them<00:03:16.659> in<00:03:16.720> something<00:03:17.019> like<00:03:17.169> that<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:17.590> a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
break them in something like that for a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.439 
break them in something like that for a
studio<00:03:17.979> environment<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.699> you<00:03:18.729> basically<00:03:19.000> want

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
studio environment so you basically want

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.780 
studio environment so you basically want
each<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.750> antennas<00:03:19.870> on<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:21.159> different<00:03:21.639> type

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
each of the antennas on a different type

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.490 
each of the antennas on a different type
of<00:03:21.939> angle<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.329> different<00:03:22.449> type<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.840> direction

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
of angle a different type of direction

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.360 
of angle a different type of direction
as<00:03:23.949> as<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:26.019> other<00:03:26.169> will<00:03:26.590> all<00:03:26.769> all<00:03:26.979> different

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
as as the other will all all different

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.589 
as as the other will all all different
to<00:03:27.430> each<00:03:27.549> other<00:03:27.729> so<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.120> can<00:03:28.239> see<00:03:28.389> there<00:03:28.540> I've

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
to each other so you can see there I've

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.969 
to each other so you can see there I've
got<00:03:28.659> some<00:03:28.930> little<00:03:29.079> lifts<00:03:29.319> on<00:03:29.409> the<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.709> some

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
got some little lifts on the right some

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.759 
got some little lifts on the right some
45<00:03:30.400> degrees<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.120> one<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.870> them<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.109> ease<00:03:32.590> up

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
45 degrees and one of them is ease up

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.309 
45 degrees and one of them is ease up
and<00:03:32.919> down<00:03:33.389> so<00:03:34.389> that's<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.689> usual<00:03:34.959> set<00:03:35.109> up<00:03:35.229> a

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
and down so that's the usual set up a

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.589 
and down so that's the usual set up a
dufus<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.709> do<00:03:35.859> setups<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:37.329> then<00:03:37.419> on<00:03:37.509> the

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
dufus to do setups and then on the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.939 
dufus to do setups and then on the
bottom<00:03:37.689> here<00:03:38.019> we<00:03:38.229> have<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.979> receiver<00:03:39.870> which<00:03:40.870> is

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
bottom here we have a receiver which is

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.039 
bottom here we have a receiver which is
receiving<00:03:41.949> the<00:03:42.340> signal<00:03:42.699> from<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.329> transmitter

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
receiving the signal from a transmitter

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.819 
receiving the signal from a transmitter
which<00:03:44.349> is<00:03:45.359> which<00:03:46.359> is<00:03:46.389> backstage<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.109> that's

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
which is which is backstage and that's

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.830 
which is which is backstage and that's
receiving<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.720> teleprompter<00:03:50.459> video<00:03:51.840> so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
receiving the the teleprompter video so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.479 
receiving the the teleprompter video so
that's<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.319> receiver<00:03:53.739> that's<00:03:54.159> on<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.340> bottom

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
that's a receiver that's on the bottom

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.119 
that's a receiver that's on the bottom
of<00:03:54.669> the<00:03:54.759> rig<00:03:54.909> and<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:56.409> this<00:03:56.590> case<00:03:56.859> we're

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
of the rig and in this case we're

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.069 
of the rig and in this case we're
actually<00:03:57.250> coming<00:03:57.459> composit<00:03:58.090> out<00:03:58.239> which<00:03:58.930> is

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
actually coming composit out which is

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.449 
actually coming composit out which is
being<00:03:59.290> fed<00:03:59.650> up<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.939> top<00:04:01.359> monitor<00:04:02.400> for<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
being fed up to the top monitor for the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.719 
being fed up to the top monitor for the
autocue<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:05.319> could<00:04:06.099> be<00:04:06.189> anything<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.549> could

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
autocue that could be anything you could

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.209 
autocue that could be anything you could
use<00:04:06.849> that<00:04:06.879> for<00:04:07.169> return<00:04:08.169> video<00:04:08.409> so<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:08.829> can<00:04:08.979> be

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.219 
use that for return video so it can be

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.670 
use that for return video so it can be
seeking<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.759> be<00:04:09.849> feeding<00:04:10.060> HD<00:04:10.989> SDI<00:04:11.229> if<00:04:11.439> you<00:04:11.530> like

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
seeking to be feeding HD SDI if you like

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.770 
seeking to be feeding HD SDI if you like
or<00:04:11.979> SDI<00:04:12.340> or<00:04:12.459> composite<00:04:13.329> doesn't<00:04:13.509> really<00:04:13.629> make

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
or SDI or composite doesn't really make

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.390 
or SDI or composite doesn't really make
much<00:04:13.900> difference<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.799> important<00:04:15.189> thing<00:04:15.370> here

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
much difference the important thing here

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.979 
much difference the important thing here
is<00:04:15.639> because<00:04:15.759> these<00:04:16.239> are<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.479> similar

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
is because these are on similar

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.319 
is because these are on similar
frequencies<00:04:17.650> or<00:04:18.430> certainly<00:04:18.699> the<00:04:18.820> same<00:04:19.000> band

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
frequencies or certainly the same band

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.689 
frequencies or certainly the same band
you<00:04:20.260> need<00:04:20.469> to<00:04:20.560> get<00:04:20.709> some<00:04:20.889> separation<00:04:21.370> between

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
you need to get some separation between

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.750 
you need to get some separation between
these<00:04:22.029> two<00:04:22.090> units<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.889> have<00:04:24.159> to<00:04:24.400> have

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
these two units so you have to have

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.000 
these two units so you have to have
the<00:04:24.940> receiver<00:04:25.420> on<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.320> bottom<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> rig

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the receiver on the bottom of the rig

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.940 
the receiver on the bottom of the rig
and<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.910> transmitter<00:04:28.510> on<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.870> top<00:04:29.110> if<00:04:29.680> you

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
and the transmitter on the top if you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.890 
and the transmitter on the top if you
ought<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.070> have<00:04:30.280> this<00:04:30.520> trance<00:04:30.910> if<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.540> have<00:04:31.720> if

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
ought to have this trance if you have if

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.140 
ought to have this trance if you have if
you<00:04:31.960> were<00:04:32.080> having<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.350> receiver<00:04:33.150> say

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
you were having this receiver say

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.690 
you were having this receiver say
sitting<00:04:34.480> up<00:04:34.690> here<00:04:34.930> then<00:04:35.800> what<00:04:36.070> happens<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.550> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
sitting up here then what happens is you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.490 
sitting up here then what happens is you
have<00:04:36.730> receiver<00:04:37.480> antennas<00:04:38.080> which<00:04:38.290> are

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
have receiver antennas which are

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.110 
have receiver antennas which are
literally<00:04:39.250> centimeters<00:04:39.910> away<00:04:40.000> from

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
literally centimeters away from

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.690 
literally centimeters away from
transmitter<00:04:40.840> antennas<00:04:41.320> on<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.560> similar<00:04:42.430> band

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
transmitter antennas on a similar band

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.660 
transmitter antennas on a similar band
and<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.420> blows<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:44.350> out<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:44.920> we<00:04:45.190> won't<00:04:45.400> work

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
and it blows it out and it we won't work

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.960 
and it blows it out and it we won't work
so<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:47.260> can't<00:04:47.590> actually<00:04:47.920> have<00:04:48.370> returned

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
so you can't actually have returned

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.750 
so you can't actually have returned
video<00:04:49.390> or<00:04:49.690> autocue<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.190> shoulder<00:04:51.640> mount

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
video or autocue in a shoulder mount

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.180 
video or autocue in a shoulder mount
environment<00:04:52.450> because<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.440> receiver<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
environment because the receiver and the

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.590 
environment because the receiver and the
transmitter<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.730> is<00:04:54.820> too<00:04:55.000> close<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.480> each

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
transmitter it is too close to each

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200 
transmitter it is too close to each
other<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:56.020> need<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.740> have<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.190> few<00:04:57.880> feet<00:04:58.180> of

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
other you need to have a few feet of

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.560 
other you need to have a few feet of
separation<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:59.140> allow<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.650> receiver<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:01.390> not

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
separation to allow that receiver to not

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.710 
separation to allow that receiver to not
be<00:05:01.750> swamped<00:05:02.260> by<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.760> transmitter<00:05:04.300> which<00:05:04.570> is

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
be swamped by the transmitter which is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.050 
be swamped by the transmitter which is
