 quad chip mediatek and 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.840
 unusually nice design new home 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.189
 feature has become installation support 3

 also batteries with a capacity of 3500 mA 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.810
 o'clock 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.210
 liquid there are 700 qualitatively assembled 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 the design is tough enough even 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.750
 load case does not creak and not 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.489

 coatings that dominate the hull 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.700
 will rescue presentable appearance on 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.510
 for a long time the thickness of the smartphone when 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.190
 weight 155 grams does not exceed 9.9 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.290
 millimeter all functional elements 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.210
 installed here according to the classical scheme 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.860
 the only thing different is our gadget 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.840
 other android smartphones from a key 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.370
 the same pit it can be configured to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.320
 performance of various functions 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.700
 for example starting a camera or any 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.739
 installed service applications 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.840
 maintained as a short press of the same 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.000
 holding the key if necessary 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.100
 you can turn off and i inch inch

 air gap issue quality 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.950
 a picture is not worth finding fault here 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.110
 true sensor supports up to 5 touches 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.740
 at the same time but that's enough for any 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.540
 action user android version 44 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.140
 kitkat with standard applications and 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.880
 services 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 add a little graphic 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.240
 winding up with manufacturers winds wrong 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.580
 far from the stock version 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.940
 operating system 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.710
 Mediatek mt6582 chip installed here 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.450
 it contains a quad 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.210

 gigahertz and video accelerator mali-400 mp2 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.840
 the system is supplemented by two gigabytes 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.930
 RAM storage 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.369
 provides 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.229
 synthetic tests acer liquid e 700 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.400
 showed a good side in 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.750
 real use available 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.220
 performance is enough for disclosure 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.040
 all the possibilities that are laid

 40 and now with the support of a-gps work then 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.930
 unstable gps module after some 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.850
 time after a cold start is caught around 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.740
 ten satellites main chip 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.900
 device has become installation support 3 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.610

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.700
 milliamper hours enough for a few 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.690
 days of using the gadget with moderate 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.120
 load and rational use
