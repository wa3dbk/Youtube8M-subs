00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 so hello come to me for a new one 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.179
 turn on video thanks my name is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920
 I have one more person today 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 a little more information to the soon 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.010
 appearing new dlc of battlefield 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.930
 4 that on the name wear steve the as 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.330
 first-served weapons of those 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 we have heard are already visible 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.820
 unplayable well, at least indirectly 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.830
 which one but in any case 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.410
 It should be remembered that this is about it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 is quite old files and therefore zb 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 their sites are missing after malle 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 animation something weird or act 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 some even allegedly still weapons 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 placeholder sounds actually use that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.690
 are from other weapons 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.399
 I myself have such a time 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.129
 little time around all weapons and gadgets 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.989
 to test for yourself but as I said everything 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.480
 What I'm here in the video storyteller especially 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 just when it comes to small details 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.420
 still change 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.670
 Nevertheless, it is interesting 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.399
 everything to look at and a little bit too 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 analyze and that 's what it's all about today 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.920
 controversial new robot is called maas 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.290
 with double a and will be like other gadgets 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 This is operated via a remote control 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.280
 gadget is basically nothing 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
 gadget and besides, it's theoretical 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.229
 Also available for every class because it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.299
 a battle picker will be everything else 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 probably just too much if 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.159
 suddenly everyone with his new one 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
 toys would jet through the area 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 Weapon technology is the mars with 600 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.530
 shot of his agency 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.200
 At least the weapon sounds when 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.020
 fire like one of the stationary ones 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.140
 agencies and not like the normal ones 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 Besides, it also overheats what you expect 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.820
 the continuous fire should prevent 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.060
 Furthermore, you have twelve grenades for 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.640
 his grenade launcher in terms of it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.280
 pistols are we endorse steve 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.399
 getting two new ones is one of them 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.229
 the coveted usually involves one of 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.659
 many other successful ego 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.180
 shooting knows me also interested 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.939
 the weapon is incredibly strong because of her 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.220
 Character with new shows in the magazine 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.289
 has the digel in its damage class 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.180
 the nose forward than harm class take 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.100
 I just say that somehow 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.380
 between 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 placed in other revolvers is the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.360
 Ironsides have an extremely clean-up 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.370
 long and annoying animations that that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.010
 Repeat accurate shooting for longer 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.200
 Distances to qual make even if the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.700
 ironside were placed correctly 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.340
 The weapon does not always seem to go straight to you 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.920
 meet a fairly high spread 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.200
 suggests the rechargers 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.560
 animation very authentic and the fire 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.380
 is exactly the next second weapon 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.000
 the uniqa six also a revolver like 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.490
 everyone else wants it so far 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.730
 in battlefield 4 there is also the uniqa 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.100
 606 shot in her drum magazine and 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.630
 that will be incredible 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.370
 exaggerated recharge animation 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.710
 exchanged as you can see here 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.750
 after a while I can 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.680
 me the weapon at least from the recoil ago 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.750
 definitely imagine 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.490
 the adinside are bad as usual 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.800
 So you see relatively little but 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.290
 at least they do not have too long 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.470
 and annoying animation after a shot 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.970
 just as it was with the desert eagle 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.880
 out of the abdominal feeling, I have so 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.050
 the impression that the sik mpx really 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.060
 could be interesting 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.080
 One of the highlights of the weapon you can 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.850
 Unfortunately, do not say so much yet 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.460
 or nothing because the 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.590
 I miss it all yet 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.440
 made some shooting exercises and conspicuous 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.090
 was there that she was very discreet 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.610
 if that makes sense now she has one 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.200
 extremely pleasant firing rate just fine 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.080
 control and recoil and with theirs 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.780
 25 shot in the magazine she is too 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.790
 something quite well equipped 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.980
 Strange , however, was that the ball 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.260
 speed so the speed 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.270
 with the individual project iwe through 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.800
 the area is really high 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.630
 appeared and I find that honest 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.700
 It's pretty good because it's so natural 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.520
 easier is the fired shots 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.010
 also to assert 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.920
 The first bad design weapon is called 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.010
 bulldozer and the name is here program 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.410
 she looks extremely heavy and falls out 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.150
 shoot with a whole 20 shot in the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.550
 magazine was still fun 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.470
 also the recharge animation seems 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.900
 not too long but otherwise 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.320
 I can call the weapon bulldozer 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.310
 not too much to say dragons deep 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.200
 also brings a new one 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.350
 sniper rifle with it on 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.780
 hear the name cs5 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.730
 rather short or without actual 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.830
 visor or any signs of 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.130
 Of course, I can do even less ironside 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.080
 say as usual but what i can say 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.270
 is that with the weapon just at this 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.850
 just really notice that the game 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.620
 or the files really are not on the 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.690
 latest news is what I mean by that 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.480
 just want a release 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.880
 Rain Eft leads a lot to the e3 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.530
 probably works oh and too good 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.600
 Last we still takes protective shield 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.460
 what could that be good for and what about that? 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.140
 a new game mode has to do 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.270
 I tell you in another video 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.650
 because we are already here at the end of 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.480
 this video 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.040
 if you liked the video 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.020
 Of course I'm very much over one 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.550
 thumb upwards and if you like that 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.860
 latest of the latest about battlefield 4 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.960
 and other great videos like weapons 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.120
 Guides do not want to miss me 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.160
 I would also like to have an abo friends 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.550
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.550
 next time
