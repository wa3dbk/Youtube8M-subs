 no further savings today we 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.000
 We continue newspapers from transmits ria news

 in April May addiction 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.240
 according to company experts 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.949
 parents are ugly 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.869

 andrew himself 14 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.400
 but just to answer my ex

 days tandem honey flat lintels 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.820
 and secondly 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.730
 design immediately eight thermal 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.660
 pipes 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.340
 both factors lead to heat being very 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.690
 evenly distributed over 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.020
 surface cooler 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.890
 there is another feature which 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.470
 so as not conducive to scotch 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.900
 heat dissipation 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.530
 it was a location test 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.720
 heat pipes 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.220
 such contact with the processor cover 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.770
 you can't call perfect and that's why 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.000
 no claim exactly so perfect 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.970
 polished this flat surface 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.950
 cooler here skype engineers on top 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.790
 the price of such an asset is 60 dollars and this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.560
 not bad considering 14 centimeters and filip 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.730
 rapidly melting bundled with only 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.240
 over the years and himself capable 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 vary the speed from the pedestal to 1700 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.890
 rpm 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 there are hands on kiddies which 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.479
 switch fans work and exactly 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.620
 control is automatic if 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.210
 you get tired of tightening up revenue 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.290
 devices cord length of 30 centimeters 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.590
 allow you to install abad in any family

 of the rarest birds from the sea 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.079
 with 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.719
 in response to deliver on the shoulders very wet 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.719
 you can say maxim 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.879
 I have this can prevent high 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.009
 at a pace 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.109
 can stop the second or even 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.079
 the third week but they need to buy stage 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.569
 complete insulator is very quiet 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.009
 to show second to yourself at 15 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.549
 centimeters fan blades 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.099
 rolled down to 2580 rpm 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.229
 provide quite intense immediately in 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.970
 the result 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.540
 4 degrees a big contribution to the victory

 she however 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.060
 otherwise it was 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.500
 our understanding of the channels 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.459
 this is especially true in light of
