00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.299
 gameplay my name is Yuri Aksenov and this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.160
 review on the new year of the company glu mobile 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.639
 called contract killer 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 sniper is the third part of the series and let's 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 let's see what's new here than it is better 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.410
 the second part she will do at the end 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 any conclusions on this toy 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.460
 toy like the previous two parts 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.480
 distributed free of charge represents 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.849
 she is a shooting range and of course there is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.330
 Donat but in principle you can play without 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.340
 him 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.110
 what are the innovations here 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 we now have a base 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.010
 the base is generating us diamonds per hour 100 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 pieces but maybe it can be improved 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.430
 and so let the diamonds be 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 earn faster recommended 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.260
 always take diamonds because 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 you may be attacked and then your options 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.090
 kidnap what can you do for defense 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.210
 bases you can increase the amount 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.640
 guards installs additional 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 turrets increase player health and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.100
 there is also a base economics section 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.260
 which actually and increase the production 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 the very amount of crystals you are 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 will receive during the allotted 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.670
 time you are also in beer mode and peak 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.979
 can attack other players and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.850
 totally real and capture them 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.470
 bases and pick them up crystals yourself 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.840
 Generally such a novelty that not 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 was neither in the first and in the second part she 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 let's look at companies in mode 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.369
 the company has such a map 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 peace and in principle missions here will be by 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 the whole world everywhere you will need 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.060
 perform various tasks 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.119
 what type of mission there is here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 mission type kill all kill and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.270
 certain person that is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.820
 given goal to destroy objects on 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.369
 certain costs and also more 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.740
 let's say there are missions where you need to lay 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.469
 the bomb and everything around these missions will 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.719
 spin and spin as you see 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.689
 some missions blue some red 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.670
 what is different on the red mission to us 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.239
 not enough power to us 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.039
 you will need to upgrade it to 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.319
 we got the opportunity to go to 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.629
 this mission 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.849
 blue mission open and in them we can 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.859
 participate so here is our goal to kill 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.950
 some character for example here i am 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:27.170
 aim to destroy all enemies so that 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.500
 we are here on well here also kill one 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.629
 of the enemies for each mission will be 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.769
 reward in the form of experience and money 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.599
 respectively 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.090
 experience is needed to discover 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.489
 new weapons and money is needed for 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.590
 to naturally buy weapons and 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.260
 do upgrades as well as here 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.439
 various items that will help you 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.299
 make it easier to pass 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.769
 A grenade launcher is a knife with which you 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.040
 can silently eliminate 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.129
 opponents well and basically everything is so 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.709
 let's go ahead and look at the fact 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.310
 what do we have here we can with 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.840
 using the slider to move away 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.909
 scope we can clean and when you 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.980
 point for example a sight at 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.469
 any of your enemies right away 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.780
 who is identified for example 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.419
 sniper commando 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.519
 Well, in general, other types of characters 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.290
 which here naturally have 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.409
 each of these types of character are available 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.220
 someone has his own life more 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.959
 and someone more powerful weapons well and here in 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.980
 such a spirit is also in each unit 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:38.410
 there are various so to speak 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.050
 features for example well in general you are me 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.210
 understood it already said a hundred times and so here 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.490
 this baptist we need him 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.890
 eliminate how we can eliminate we 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.720
 can shoot at him and kill we can 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.250
 wait for the moment for example when he 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.370
 any gas barrels will do 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.670
 or for example to the car blow it up so 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.820
 most neutralize it in general like this 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.130
 here we can act move moves in in 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.900
 a lot of game and everyone will choose exactly 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.820
 which he wants I suggest probably 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.370
 just kill him yes good to me 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.830
 it turned out the Baptist runs away and I hike 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.790
 screwed up the mission I did not think that he 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.739
 will run away 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.640
 and no watch he just took his 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.430
 position and his position on 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.650
 far so he runs and 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.960
 get on it is quite complicated 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.780
 distressed and at the time his henchmen 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.760
 begin to attack on me and therefore very 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.500
 important all the same in this game in the calculation 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360
 payment 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.880
 if you hurry and will act 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.640
 since acting is a high probability 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.070
 the fact that your mission will be overwhelmed and 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.110
 you lose the graphics level in the game 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.240
 the toy has grown significantly 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.540
 look much prettier than she 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.210
 looked and before that it certainly plus 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.240
 to the game at the expense of optimization with optimization 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.240
 In principle, all the same normal toy 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.060
 everything goes without lags without glitches 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.390
 quickly loaded and play in principle one 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.820
 pleasure is the only minus as 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.610
 probably a minus from all games like 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.430
 genre in the monotony of gameplay 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.040
 because all missions are like one to 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.170
 another and with time probably all the same 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.360
 play this game get bored but since 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:27.520
 the game is free so it is in principle and 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.740
 and probably justifies because you 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.390
 do not spend anything when you get bored 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.090
 just can with a clear conscience 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.900
 peace of mind and and quit basically 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.880
 not bad there with donat which is not 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.390
 strongly at least gives on the initial 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.790
 stages 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.590
 with a new vision of video base defense and 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.810
 by the way, energy is only needed for 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.030
 attacks on 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.230
 bases of other players and for passing 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.169
 campaigns 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.120
 energy is not needed in general 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.669
 quite balanced and here the system 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.760
 Donata so you can play shoot 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.550
 you can set bombs to war and 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.470
 by killing enemies in general a good shooting range 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.220
 who liked swing but who doesn't love 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:11.150
 cheese and then do not swing everything while with you 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.150
 I was Yuri Aksenov
