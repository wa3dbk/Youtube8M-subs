00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
with olive oil first yeah and then add

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:29.210 
with olive oil first yeah and then add
the<00:01:16.270> butter<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:16.900> it<00:01:17.020> doesn't<00:01:17.409> overheat<00:01:17.920> on

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220

bread<00:01:30.220> crumbs<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.990> could<00:01:32.170> be<00:01:32.320> any

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470

breadcrumbs

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.290 

I<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.950> wondering<00:01:51.340> how<00:01:51.460> you're<00:01:51.670> gonna<00:01:51.820> do<00:01:52.060> this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
I was wondering how you're gonna do this

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.570 
I was wondering how you're gonna do this
because<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:53.220> didn't<00:01:54.220> think<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
because I didn't think of the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.430 
because I didn't think of the
breadcrumbs<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.750> that's<00:01:58.929> why<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.170> put<00:01:59.259> the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
breadcrumbs so that's why you put the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:11.410 
breadcrumbs so that's why you put the
breadcrumb<00:01:59.950> yeah

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.940

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and you don't really need to cook them

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:57.380 
and you don't really need to cook them
just<00:02:14.250> Brown<00:02:14.490> them<00:02:53.810> thank<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> yeah
