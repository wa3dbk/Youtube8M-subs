I<00:01:26.600> wanted<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.780> character<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.289> be<00:01:28.410> extremely

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
I wanted this character to be extremely

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.950 
I wanted this character to be extremely
crisp<00:01:29.190> so<00:01:29.550> I<00:01:29.580> wasn't<00:01:29.880> gonna<00:01:30.030> use<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.660> brush

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
crisp so I wasn't gonna use the brush

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
crisp so I wasn't gonna use the brush
tool<00:01:31.259> which<00:01:31.830> creates<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.429> a<00:01:32.520> blobby<00:01:32.789> look

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
tool which creates kind of a blobby look

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.779 
tool which creates kind of a blobby look
I<00:01:33.780> wanted<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.890> create<00:01:35.460> something

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
I wanted to actually create something

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.730 
I wanted to actually create something
that<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.690> crisp<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.560> lines

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that was very crisp and all the lines

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
that was very crisp and all the lines
had<00:01:38.070> equal<00:01:38.460> width<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.300> lot<00:01:39.420> easier<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
had equal width so it's a lot easier to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.080 
had equal width so it's a lot easier to
do<00:01:39.929> that<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.710> stroke<00:01:41.250> tool<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> line

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
do that with the stroke tool in the line

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.260 
do that with the stroke tool in the line

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.149 
get at kind of spotting what looks off
and<00:02:29.930> what<00:02:30.019> doesn't<00:02:30.349> look<00:02:30.379> off<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.799> terms<00:02:30.980> of

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
and what doesn't look off in terms of

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.809 
and what doesn't look off in terms of
perspective<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.150> shapes<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.409> sizes<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
perspective and shapes and sizes and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.789 
perspective and shapes and sizes and
proportions<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.170> can't<00:02:36.379> really<00:02:36.560> do<00:02:36.769> that

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
proportions you can't really do that

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.319 
proportions you can't really do that
right<00:02:37.129> out<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> gate<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.760> lot<00:02:37.879> of<00:02:38.000> people<00:02:38.209> are

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
right out the gate a lot of people are

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.940 
right out the gate a lot of people are
quicker<00:02:38.510> than<00:02:38.629> other<00:02:39.019> people<00:02:39.409> but<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.650> took<00:02:39.799> me

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
quicker than other people but it took me

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.979 
quicker than other people but it took me
a<00:02:39.980> long<00:02:40.129> time<00:02:40.189> to<00:02:41.000> kind<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.269> get<00:02:41.420> proportions

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
a long time to kind of get proportions

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.229 
a long time to kind of get proportions
down<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:42.829> still<00:02:43.040> working<00:02:43.310> at<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:46.120> now<00:02:47.120> I'm

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
down and I'm still working at it now I'm

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.640 
down and I'm still working at it now I'm
going<00:02:47.480> out<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.689> smoothing<00:02:48.049> on<00:02:48.109> his<00:02:48.230> mustache

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
going out and smoothing on his mustache

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.860 
going out and smoothing on his mustache
right<00:02:48.920> here<00:02:49.299> making<00:02:50.299> sure<00:02:50.329> that<00:02:50.569> everything

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
right here making sure that everything

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.990 
right here making sure that everything
looks<00:02:50.959> nice<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.439> rounded<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.670> can<00:02:55.819> see

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
looks nice and rounded and you can see

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.390 
looks nice and rounded and you can see
through<00:02:56.239> parts<00:02:56.629> of<00:02:56.870> his<00:02:57.139> body<00:02:57.440> because<00:02:58.370> I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
through parts of his body because I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.490 
through parts of his body because I
haven't<00:02:58.700> colored<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.599> anything<00:02:59.840> yet<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
haven't colored in anything yet and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.680 
haven't colored in anything yet and
that's<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.220> key<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.849> make<00:03:01.879> sure<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.299> all

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
that's the key is to make sure that all

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.479 
that's the key is to make sure that all
the<00:03:02.989> outlines<00:03:03.379> look<00:03:03.620> good<00:03:03.799> before<00:03:04.159> you<00:03:04.220> start

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
the outlines look good before you start

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.369 
the outlines look good before you start
coloring<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.000> shading<00:03:05.090> because<00:03:05.629> if<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:06.170> need

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
coloring and shading because if you need

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.170 
coloring and shading because if you need
to<00:03:06.470> change<00:03:06.680> anything<00:03:07.159> later<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.909> gonna<00:03:08.000> be

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
to change anything later it's gonna be

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.729 
to change anything later it's gonna be
ten<00:03:08.389> times<00:03:08.420> tougher<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.109> do<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.349> after<00:03:09.470> it's

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
ten times tougher to do it after it's

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.229 
ten times tougher to do it after it's
colored<00:03:10.069> so<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:10.609> want<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.819> make<00:03:10.939> sure<00:03:10.970> that

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
colored so you want to make sure that

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.660 
colored so you want to make sure that
everything<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.930> looking<00:03:12.560> good<00:03:12.709> first<00:03:13.040> all<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
shapes are ride the stroke with look

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.320 
shapes are ride the stroke with look
good<00:03:17.060> before<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:17.510> start<00:03:17.900> coloring<00:03:18.079> things

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330
