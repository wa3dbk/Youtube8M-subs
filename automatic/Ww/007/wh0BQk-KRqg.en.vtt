normal driving conditions why you

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
actually need six gears performance

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.609 
actually need six gears performance
though<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.210> very<00:01:47.479> good<00:01:47.720> there's<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:47.990> slight<00:01:48.289> lag

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619
