00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
what's your outlook for 2014 20 outlook

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.020 
what's your outlook for 2014 20 outlook
for<00:00:05.520> 2014<00:00:06.089> given<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.830> 2013<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:08.760> don't<00:00:08.880> have

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
for 2014 given that 2013 we don't have

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.520 
for 2014 given that 2013 we don't have
the<00:00:09.090> final<00:00:09.570> numbers<00:00:09.840> but<00:00:10.019> probably<00:00:10.290> was<00:00:10.500> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
the final numbers but probably was a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.410 
the final numbers but probably was a
little<00:00:10.800> bit<00:00:10.889> down<00:00:11.599> or<00:00:12.599> flat<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.320> think<00:00:13.849> we<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
little bit down or flat I think we see a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.540 
little bit down or flat I think we see a
mix<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> kind<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.990> opportunities<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.890> maybe

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
mix of kind of opportunities and maybe

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.060 
mix of kind of opportunities and maybe
problems<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.210> into<00:00:18.480> 2014<00:00:19.109> we'd<00:00:19.710> expect

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
problems going into 2014 we'd expect

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.400 
problems going into 2014 we'd expect
China<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.810> bounced<00:00:21.810> back<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.230> bit

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
China to be bounced back a little bit

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
China to be bounced back a little bit

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
because there's some of the models that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300 
because there's some of the models that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

twenty eight percent can that momentum

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
twenty eight percent can that momentum
continued<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.969> unlikely<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.750> mean<00:00:52.050> we

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
continued it's unlikely I mean we

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.040 
continued it's unlikely I mean we
obviously<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.399> introduced<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> Flying<00:00:54.750> Spur

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
obviously we introduced the Flying Spur

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420 
obviously we introduced the Flying Spur
which<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> big<00:00:55.680> boost<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.129> us<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
which was a big boost for us in the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
which was a big boost for us in the
latter<00:00:56.640> half<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> year<00:00:57.180> we've<00:00:58.140> done

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
latter half of the year we've done

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.549 
latter half of the year we've done
really<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> Continental<00:01:01.050> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
really well with with the Continental so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
really well with with the Continental so
we<00:01:01.739> hope<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> grow<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.969> bit<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.359> but

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
we hope to grow a little bit more but

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.820 
we hope to grow a little bit more but
I'm<00:01:04.199> certainly<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.400> kind<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:06.049> 20s<00:01:07.049> 25<00:01:07.650> per

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I'm certainly not the kind of 20s 25 per

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.830 
I'm certainly not the kind of 20s 25 per
cents<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.159> we've<00:01:08.369> seen<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> think<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
cents that we've seen so I think if the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
cents that we've seen so I think if the
markets<00:01:10.229> more<00:01:10.560> less<00:01:10.740> stable<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.280> will

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
markets more less stable I think will

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.340 
markets more less stable I think will
grow<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.229> not

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
grow a little bit but we're not

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.840 
grow a little bit but we're not
certainly<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.130> planning<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.670> big

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
certainly not planning the big big

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.429 
certainly not planning the big big
growth<00:01:15.030> figures<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.479> we've<00:01:15.600> seen<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
growth figures that we've seen in the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
growth figures that we've seen in the
last<00:01:16.500> couple<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.009> years<00:01:17.070> how<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> UK

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
last couple of years how about the UK

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
last couple of years how about the UK
are<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.780> gonna<00:01:19.170> continue<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.830> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
are we gonna continue to see that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.280 
are we gonna continue to see that
marketing<00:01:20.580> though<00:01:20.670> unless<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.450> mean<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> UK

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
marketing though unless I mean the UK

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.590 
marketing though unless I mean the UK
has<00:01:22.380> been<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.860> mystery<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:24.240> everybody

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
has been a kind of mystery for everybody

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.929 
has been a kind of mystery for everybody
in<00:01:24.720> Europe<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:26.070> until<00:01:26.220> recently<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
in Europe because up until recently the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.429 
in Europe because up until recently the
economic<00:01:27.390> indicators<00:01:27.930> haven't<00:01:28.200> been<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
economic indicators haven't been that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:28.730 
economic indicators haven't been that
good

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
good

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.170 
good
but<00:01:29.340> we've<00:01:29.490> had<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> few<00:01:29.850> months<00:01:29.970> i<00:01:30.150> couldn't

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
but we've had a few months i couldn't

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.980 
but we've had a few months i couldn't
use<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> UK<00:01:31.640> we<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:33.479> had<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> good<00:01:33.780> year

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
use in the UK we really had a good year

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
use in the UK we really had a good year
we<00:01:34.200> were<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:34.500> than<00:01:34.649> twenty<00:01:34.890> percent<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.759> in

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we were more than twenty percent up in

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.230 
we were more than twenty percent up in
the<00:01:36.060> UK<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> huge<00:01:36.990> market<00:01:37.409> share

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the UK and we have a huge market share

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.460 
the UK and we have a huge market share
but<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> home<00:01:39.630> market<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> guess

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
but it's a home market so I guess

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
but it's a home market so I guess
perhaps<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.890> would<00:01:41.009> expect<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.450> again<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
perhaps you would expect that again I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.499 
perhaps you would expect that again I
say<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> UK<00:01:43.289> will<00:01:43.409> probably<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:44.299> stable<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
say the UK will probably be stable in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.810 
say the UK will probably be stable in
terms<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.289> luxury<00:01:46.590> market<00:01:46.619> stable<00:01:47.340> on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
terms of the luxury market stable on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.980 
terms of the luxury market stable on
2004<00:01:48.659> 13<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.409> 2014<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.899> you're

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
2004 13 in 2014 so I think you're

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350 
2004 13 in 2014 so I think you're
targeting<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.560> 15,000<00:01:53.460> units<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.880> year<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
targeting about 15,000 units a year and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.480 
targeting about 15,000 units a year and
2018<00:01:55.110> yeah<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.130> addition

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
2018 yeah but that's with the addition

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.139 
2018 yeah but that's with the addition
of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.119> SUV<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:58.409> will<00:01:58.590> bring<00:01:58.759> new<00:01:59.759> volume

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
of the SUV which will bring new volume

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
of the SUV which will bring new volume
and<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.600> development<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.709> the<00:02:01.830> rest<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
and some development with the rest of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.539 
and some development with the rest of
the<00:02:02.250> range<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.750> 15,000<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.100> depends<00:02:05.459> on

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the range so 15,000 but it it depends on

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.460 
the range so 15,000 but it it depends on
the<00:02:05.610> market<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.600> can't<00:02:06.840> make<00:02:07.289> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
the market you know we can't make the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.740 
the market you know we can't make the
market<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.910> has<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.269> come<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.630> if

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
market that has to come but if

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
market that has to come but if
everything<00:02:10.080> works<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.920> would<00:02:11.069> hope

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
everything works is we we would hope

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.670 
everything works is we we would hope
than<00:02:11.819> 15,000<00:02:12.690> should<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.989> should<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.440> possible

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
than 15,000 should be should be possible

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
than 15,000 should be should be possible
for<00:02:14.130> us<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.819> we've<00:02:15.000> all<00:02:15.120> seen<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> concept

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.559 
course yeah i think you know we've been
successful<00:02:57.250> with<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.819> consonants<00:02:58.329> with<00:02:58.390> the

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
successful with the consonants with the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.949 
successful with the consonants with the
planes<00:02:58.870> were<00:02:59.370> finding<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.430> luxury<00:03:00.819> niche<00:03:01.030> just

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
planes were finding a luxury niche just

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.599 
planes were finding a luxury niche just
above<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.230> top<00:03:02.530> premium<00:03:02.980> players<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.579> I

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
above the top premium players and I

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.240 
above the top premium players and I
think<00:03:03.640> we'll<00:03:03.939> see<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> same<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.709> with

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
think we'll see the same with the with

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.089 
think we'll see the same with the with
the<00:03:06.459> SUV<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:08.109> think<00:03:08.290> there's<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.920> market

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
the SUV so we think there's a market

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.199 
the SUV so we think there's a market
there<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.459> course<00:03:09.579> it's<00:03:09.760> not<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.909> massive

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
there of course it's not a massive

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.539 
there of course it's not a massive
market<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.079> enough<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:11.709> us<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.519> think

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
market but enough for us and I think

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.250 
market but enough for us and I think
it'll<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.120> very<00:03:13.329> successful<00:03:13.510> car<00:03:13.959> for<00:03:13.989> us
