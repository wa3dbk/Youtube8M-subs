good pros for micro braiding one of the
biggest<00:00:36.540> cons<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.170> everyone<00:00:37.800> has<00:00:37.980> michael

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
biggest cons that everyone has michael

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.299 
biggest cons that everyone has michael
rating<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> takes<00:00:39.270> forever<00:00:39.739> also<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
rating is it takes forever also the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
rating is it takes forever also the
bigger<00:00:41.579> your<00:00:41.730> head<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.480> longer<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> takes

so that's a big con also the thicker
your<00:00:47.850> hair<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.629> longer<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> takes<00:00:49.260> that's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
your hair is the longer it takes that's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.310 
your hair is the longer it takes that's
a<00:00:50.070> big<00:00:50.280> con<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.329> other<00:00:51.510> kind<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.140> have

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
with it the microbe rating is that they

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
with it the microbe rating is that they
can<00:00:54.960> also<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.379> done<00:00:55.710> very<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.309> tightly<00:00:56.789> by

hair<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> lot<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> women<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
hair and you see a lot of women that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
hair and you see a lot of women that
have<00:01:05.400> hair<00:01:05.790> missing<00:01:06.479> around<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> edges

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
have hair missing around the edges

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.730 
have hair missing around the edges
because<00:01:08.090> they<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.450> their<00:01:09.750> hair<00:01:09.930> braided<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
because they get their hair braided and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370 
because they get their hair braided and
then<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.760> take<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> pull<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.780> back<00:01:12.900> into

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
then they take it and pull it back into

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
then they take it and pull it back into
a<00:01:13.409> ponytail<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.939> already<00:01:15.090> tight<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
a ponytail so it's already tight to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.149 
a ponytail so it's already tight to
begin<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> pull<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> back

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
begin with and then you pull it back

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.950 
begin with and then you pull it back
even<00:01:17.400> tighter<00:01:17.790> when<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.689> into<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
even tighter when you put it into a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
even tighter when you put it into a
ponytail<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.799> causes<00:01:20.100> stress<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.909> your

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
ponytail and it causes stress on your

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
ponytail and it causes stress on your
hair<00:01:21.330> follicles<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.740> causes<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
hair follicles which then causes the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
hair follicles which then causes the
hair<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> fall<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.479> sometimes<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> does

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hair to fall out and sometimes it does

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
hair to fall out and sometimes it does
not<00:01:25.560> go<00:01:25.830> back<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.369> permanently

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
not go back because you permanently

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.469 
not go back because you permanently
damage<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.689> follicle<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.710> other<00:01:29.159> con<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
damage that follicle the other con that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
damage that follicle the other con that
I<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.530> micro<00:01:32.220> braiding<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.909> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I have with micro braiding because it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
I have with micro braiding because it
takes<00:01:33.270> such<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> long<00:01:33.720> time<00:01:33.990> people<00:01:34.799> leave<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
takes such a long time people leave it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
takes such a long time people leave it
in<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.490> long<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> longer<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> leave<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in a long time the longer you leave it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
in a long time the longer you leave it
in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.280> harder<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.299> i

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
in the harder it is to get up i

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.450 
in the harder it is to get up i
recommend<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.439> around<00:01:40.650> four<00:01:41.009> months<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
recommend like around four months at the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
recommend like around four months at the
most<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.329> after<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> your<00:01:43.500> hair<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.770> too

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
most but after that your hair is too

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
most but after that your hair is too
tangled<00:01:44.820> underneath<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> braids<00:01:46.500> are

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
tangled underneath with the braids are

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
tangled underneath with the braids are
growing<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> takes<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.030> longer<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.750> get

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
growing in so it takes it longer to get

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.149 
growing in so it takes it longer to get
it<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.770> someone<00:01:50.009> that's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it out and if you're not someone that's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
it out and if you're not someone that's
