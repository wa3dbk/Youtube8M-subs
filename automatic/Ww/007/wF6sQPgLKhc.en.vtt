the solution there ten percent bleach
I'll<00:01:43.119> make<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.360> cut<00:01:43.690> there<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.250> draw<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.700> back

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
I'll make a cut there and draw it back

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.480 
I'll make a cut there and draw it back
like<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:53.110> your<00:01:53.259> cutting<00:01:53.619> that's

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
like that so there's your cutting that's

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.450 
like that so there's your cutting that's
it<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.060> make<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> split<00:01:55.540> like<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:57.340> your

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
it and make a split like that it's your

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.279 
it and make a split like that it's your
first<00:01:57.670> one<00:02:00.539> grab<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.690> next<00:02:01.869> one

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
first one grab the next one

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.770 
first one grab the next one
lay<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.250> down<00:02:03.990> make<00:02:04.990> an<00:02:05.110> incision<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:06.780> work

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
lay it down make an incision and work

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.020 
lay it down make an incision and work
your<00:02:07.960> way<00:02:08.019> back<00:02:08.380> if<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.369> can<00:02:09.519> draw<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> back

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
your way back if you can draw a back

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.460 
your way back if you can draw a back
that's<00:02:10.299> good<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:13.180> we've<00:02:13.330> made<00:02:13.480> another<00:02:15.299> cut

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
that's good so we've made another cut

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.449 
that's good so we've made another cut
like<00:02:17.470> that

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.420

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
then get a implement of some description

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.490 
then get a implement of some description
preferably<00:03:06.650> lost<00:03:06.950> quite<00:03:07.370> strong<00:03:08.170> make<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> hole

leave them like that the idea of putting

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.910 
leave them like that the idea of putting
in<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.030> water<00:04:01.240> it<00:04:01.510> takes<00:04:01.780> out<00:04:02.020> any<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.800> the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
in the water it takes out any of the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.190 
in the water it takes out any of the
root<00:04:03.130> hormone<00:04:03.640> that's<00:04:03.850> naturally<00:04:04.420> inside<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
root hormone that's naturally inside the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.370 
root hormone that's naturally inside the
plant<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:06.240> neutralizes<00:04:07.240> that<00:04:07.420> so<00:04:08.110> when<00:04:08.290> you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
plant and neutralizes that so when you

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.870 
plant and neutralizes that so when you
kind<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.680> do<00:04:08.800> your<00:04:08.950> cutting<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.520> can<00:04:09.580> add
