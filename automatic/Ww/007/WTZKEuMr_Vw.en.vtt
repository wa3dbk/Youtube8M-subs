00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.740
 hi it's raft video update 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.610
 for gold and for money 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.130
 tonight in euros that's what we can 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.960
 say beyond the session of the day we go 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.570
 start with gold 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.280
 good we saw last week the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.140
 bearish goals having all been 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.629
 reached we must now find a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.430
 new scenario I start you me 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.960
 I start with gold in euros so that's it 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.120
 the next support area that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.010
 already starting to produce its effects 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.510
 is there then why simply 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.780
 because if we go back enough 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.700
 far back you will notice that we have 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.070
 had a young a very supportive area 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.140
 strong here one on this period there we have 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.149
 clearly well answer bounced full has 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.399
 answered also bounced here before 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.770
 start up again so it's clear 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.020
 that this area is historically a 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.420
 support area that's why it's still a 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.950
 time that for four days well we 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.140
 seems to hold the position 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.790
 the technical indicators are very bad 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.530
 oriented with a stochastic in his 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.409
 oversold area a month a Macedonian 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.320
 below its signal is negative and 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.229
 a negative momentum but hey there are some 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.880
 positive elements in particular and seems 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.670
 although we are in the process of 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.080
 draw a bevel descending then 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.720
 that's what a bevel 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.060
 going down we're going to watch the webinar 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.430
 for his tutorial to understand 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.979
 imagine that we have courses that 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.159
 evolve inside two halves 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.810
 right incite it's so kind of 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.600
 triangle but the difference of a 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.330
 pure triangle there the two sides are going in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.390
 the same meaning an ep in opposite sense so 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.450
 we will generally have about nine 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.100
 times out of ten an exit from the top there 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.009
 will usually have a throw back or a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.930
 pullback here it evra in 50% of the cases 1 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.720
 50% of cases once we are out 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.030
 from the top already and before leaving 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.010
 towards the top we must know that we have 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.450
 also once in four a fake 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.549
 breakout star an exit and a 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.519
 reintegration of the bevel but that's 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.019
 interesting enough to go more 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.110
 before in the analysis then it takes 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.510
 know that when 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.150
 we have this output the objective it is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.340
 calculates differently first 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.540
 way of doing it is rallying the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.290
 highest part of bevel 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.610
 going down his number one goal 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.320
 goal number 2 would be to take the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.540
 plan the highest point of the bevel and 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.330
 the lowest point of the bevel of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.430
 look at the height at which that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.510
 matches and their reach above 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.390
 break point 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.940
 so that gives us the second objective 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.200
 so obviously if I talk about it this is 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.270
 not for nothing because he 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.810
 would seem like we're getting 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.290
 to draw a descending bevel on 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.840
 gold so a statistical application 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.340
 bullish good nothing is done to 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.530
 the moment we saw that this is how 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.500
 it's happening in nine out of ten times but 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.420
 good as long as we did not go out we can 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 not yet prejudged objectives that 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.810
 will be achieved but it can be enough 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.370
 interesting for us to have a glow 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
 hope then if we look now 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.260
 what happens on the money side 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.410
 denominated in euros and well it's enough 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.540
 similar look even though the trend 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.310
 fell sharply since we are 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.060
 below a mcd of a 20 and 20 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.620
 decreasing 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.790
 there was a bevel that is in the process of 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.680
 to be drawn from looking at it from 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.629
 more closely it's true that it looks like 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.939
 a little channel but I assure you 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.310
 it converges well so it's a bevel 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.939
 so here it was a little bit 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.980
 positive from the ongoing evolution to 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.560
 so follow very closely and for the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.659
 first time for quite a while I 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.049
 fed a little hope to medium 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.569
 term 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.569
 here is your good trade night tomorrow 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.290
