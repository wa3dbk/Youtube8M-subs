00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 On June 19 , 1764, he was born a few 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.030
 blocks from here in your house 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.920
 paternal grandparents josÃ© gervasio artigas 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.920
 250 years passed from that origin 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.289
 the heart 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.300
 yes 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 who was really active a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 intellectual a warrior a politician a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.250
 communicator and an idealization of eros 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 this aspect we transform a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.500
 myth to nail the blame for having done 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.640
 quite the opposite in the history of what 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 who asked for art 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.720
 the aunt was an absolutely real guy the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.820
 artiga's delivery is the call was 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.649
 bet or was I to show you that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.420
 I was sitting when a being of that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.250
 feature you take to the category 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.809
 bronze of fines and could 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.729
 think some of these games that there 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 played artigas that was a catechist 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.920
 of children especially in assumption of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.159
 Paraguay I can say what I feel 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 yes clear to me he was not a hero was 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.720
 a very macho man applied the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.339
 today's homeland was womanizing in this 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.200
 think it was with a rock singer 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 that now how it happened to be a 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
 Smuggler to become chief 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.890
 the orientals in the entrerriana earth 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.250
 of that artigas 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.700
 I wanted to be Argentine, we left it for 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.710
 that Buenos Aires thing are gamarra 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.030
 here is the flag of artigas the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.100
 flag of between reality of it 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.360
 way to the day but not only that what 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.510
 plugged into a square called 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.510
 independence 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.869
 when they are taken care of they can not talk 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.229
 between you are not either 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.479
 breathing new ones are I do not know if it should 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.080
 have heroes in the event that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.450
 I could not imagine another one that is not 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.900
 because one day he became a hero of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.410
 the homeland a homeland that he never lord 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.410
 let's go back to the origin
