00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello to all do not end up for the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 saturated saturday in vincennes which reunited 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 twenty runners on two rungs 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.000
 different areas will be dealing with 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.390
 6 and 7 year old horses with ten horses 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.150
 who will go to the post of 2850 meters 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.590
 and i'm in the company of michel burgio 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 to discuss the candidatures of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.380
 different competitors 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.550
 hello salty foods michel we did 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 the full with not competitors who 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.000
 will start at two different posts 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.840
 said his first 10 seconds and that's 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.860
 true that it 's not going to be obvious the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 numbers and the good arrival of chianti 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.960
 because they are several to be able to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.780
 to prevail or to pretend well 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 obviously at a good place the first 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 first we get the impression that quality 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 is rather at the second post but in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.190
 head and some competitors who can 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.600
 play very very good role then one 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.129
 attack right away with my favorite 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 absolutely because a reason for 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.059
 which, by the way, two favorites is 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.289
 in this context here will rush this 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.030
 second level it is the hero 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.739
 Toussaint Tuscan heather is a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.109
 brunette baune tenor girl is 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 as his father is driven by by 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.040
 bossuet jean baptiste she had done 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.630
 strong impression some time ago there 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.010
 a month ago on the racetrack of this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.470
 chosen language where she was beating a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.510
 some beckmann swedish competitor who 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 shines a thousand lights on our soil very 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.840
 beautiful impression every time she has 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.009
 debated beautifully by putting him 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.080
 the pressure in the last turn 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.009
 she disappointed afterwards for her return 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.299
 on the gravel plateau at the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.409
 shown faulty in the first turn a 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.820
 been not very comfortable in his paces 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.530
 but you have to take it back because it's a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.790
 mare of quality certainly to will 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 to start at the second rung as we 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.729
 said but the study of a good course 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.530
 she can provide the laureate of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 the test is not an impossibility I 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.380
 rebuke the trust and we could not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.710
 he judged it's true she was 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.130
 party with the favors of the public to be 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.770
 enough money and besides your your 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.869
 second choice tischendorf padd him 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 unlike two scans of brière a 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.979
 satisfied during his last race 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.720
 it's true he came 5th out of 2100 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.100
 meters from the big track on it did 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.210
 not been really lucky he took the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.439
 gallop for a given moment a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.880
 course I do not know what was done 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.530
 if he was embarrassed or not but he lost 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390
 precious lengths but the incomes 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.560
 finish well without having all his ease 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.149
 it finished at the 5th 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.619
 matthieu abrivard say it in full 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.570
 stuff in our workouts section 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.600
 and logically you have to have it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.950
 choose bass in this event my 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.210
 Police only reserve that it will not 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.080
 unsheathed from the previous ones and that's how 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.740
 that he got his best 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.790
 performances 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.690
 it's my only reservation but logically 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.440
 visual impression that left in his 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.420
 last performance 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.940
 I also hold in confidence 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.880
 okay we were talking about the two steps 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.240
 again to prefer is at the second 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.410
 post 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.150
 on the other hand your your third choice 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.310
 is called purple samurai they remain 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 on great performances but there we 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.730
 just talked about two competitors of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.590
 two previous competitors with 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.520
 gravel iron performance him 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.260
 comes from province 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.510
 here he has never run in class on 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.430
 adam senn it will be a little baptism of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.170
 fire then they come to realize a 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.360
 season since thirteen remarkable since 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.489
 that ip antennas so far bought 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 recently in June of the déferré 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.670
 four feet and horse is 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.360
 totally transformed and to win I 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.100
 you believe the wand 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.440
 succeeding him barefoot what is 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.670
 not nothing years 7 successes exactly in nine 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.200
 outings with free of four feet 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.739
 is also taken first two 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.239
 runners 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.250
 we see that the horse is in full 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.030
 progression certainly he's going he's going 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.390
 produce for the first time at 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.760
 vincennes 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.200
 it may be an unknown but we put 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.510
 the means will be franck nivard who will 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920
 to sulky so that's exactly to say 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.660
 that's exactly it smells good it smells like 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.010
 race aimed a tone around friends their 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.000
 have the means to achieve a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.709
 very great performance 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.910
 so as I said at the beginning it's 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.019
 true that my little fear is that 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.120
 will he adapt to vincennes or 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.350
 not there is his form for him he is 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.489
 better than ever logically it takes 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.530
 expect to see him play a first 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.360
 role in this ordeal and then time 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.100
 that this race is reserved for 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.380
 French horses so it's really 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.340
 good to eat initially but these are 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.269
 days where I had side would have been a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.660
 beautiful performance at the castle of 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.579
 vincennes 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.049
 it's now okay behind 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.970
 behind these three horses you have 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.100
 you have tasks and you have chosen 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.820
 of organs mf thorgen masters who comes 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.440
 to leave a very beautiful impression 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.690
 in the Friday night quinté on the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.950
 ash of vincennes would place friends a 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.910
 gave a beautiful replica and at all organic 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.410
 who is not the first to come into the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.239
 last turn he put pressure on me 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.440
 admittedly he weakens a little in the end he has 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.959
 finished fourth but that day 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.190
 the visual impression was pretty good 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.260
 he leaps at the top what is really 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.640
 a benefit and already proven on 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.660
 the courses held the big track even 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.150
 if he does not necessarily like 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.680
 but I see it in the first five 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.420
 logically it's a logical chance 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.040
 to figure in the arrival of this 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.890
 test noise absolutely if we see if 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.290
 we can see his music 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.519
 we can see on our website 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.810
 sees that on the big track he's 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.430
 really comfortable it's really a 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.660
 super her garden that's exactly so 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.920
 I think that 's really old by 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.110
 report the small track of Friday night 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.180
 So we come back with a sure value 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.980
 who is like to look even slumped 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.780
 has proven itself on the on the big 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.820
 track but who will be at the second level 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.790
 of these torricelli torricelli exactly 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.080
 torricelli you who have the football to him 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.600
 one day remembered that he wanted 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.550
 turn on absolutely the exact gravity 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.690
 that's exactly so he too not 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.800
 of quality just like the Italian player 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.940
 the time 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.370
 so it's true he just performed 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.660
 a return to cabourg that day I 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.160
 think this entry this back 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.390
 you'll see a little lungs it's a 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.560
 choice that gets ready vita and shines 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.810
 usually on its freshness 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.070
 it is confirmed on the course held 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.230
 the big track he no longer has to do his 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.820
 evidence and logically I see a 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.570
 first chance also of figure is 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.280
 the arrival of this quinté 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.630
 it's a horse hard to effort he can 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.290
 from afar it is the if need 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.570
 feels 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.850
 but logically his place in his 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.470
 category and a chance on SS7 ago 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.700
 a chance to match that of being in 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.900
 the first five which saved the 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.970
 mitchell I would have liked to contradict you 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.080
 but in addition to that we can add a 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.540
 argument is that he driven by 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.760
 someone named sebastien garat 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.780
 early and who when he engages his horses 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.220
 during the vincennes meeting 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.810
 we know we know very well that they are 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.700
 competitive and that commitment 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.169
 had to hit the eye of coaches 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.700
 standard is exactly at his return and 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.990
 theodora bella is the logical consequence of 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.210
 his program with rising power 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.919
 this race was and then all very 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.070
 good for him handed holds well 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.510
 to evoke five horses three bases 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.130
 horses to follow is what you would have 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.080
 a surprise something then to 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.280
 get out of your cat so how are 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.040
 maybe not my favorite because 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.140
 that it's worth it is samurai purple in 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.460
 this fact is as we said that it 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.940
 admired as much as ever so that will be 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.680
 my favorite 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.600
 and as surprise offers you the number 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.210
 18 years old this is sarah du plessis who 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.590
 summarizes season 2013 remarkable it takes 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.090
 know that in March is beats is 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.340
 uncertain for and from the chaos we've seen 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.020
 won recently at vincennes and finished 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.760
 second from the gnt stage to mauquenchy 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.590
 his performances who still went 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.020
 sportingly speaking very beautiful it's in 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.750
 2013 bit but then ran Vincennes 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.250
 already succeeded and logically she perfume 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.660
 she not at the far post but if she 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.220
 manages to take good backs she has 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.229
 logically a nice role to take for 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.190
 a 4th 5th place is not impossible and 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.200
 for what is the good path 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.580
 if it appears then takes him 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.060
 learn birch able to 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.350
 appear at the finish of such an event 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.270
 even among the pee I would have liked you 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.980
 contradict but precisely we were talking 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.330
 just now the talent of a director 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.490
 sebastian guarato point 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.470
 it's the same for philippe boutin who does not 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.050
 never moves to vincennes by chance 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.700
 the commitment is rather is terrible 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.830
 so we do this sarah du plessis 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.930
 maybe a surprise is what 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.880
 to complete your selection you 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.230
 have two or three more 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.419
 competitors who deserve the alley and 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.889
 of course so to suzette brévol who 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.430
 discover an ideal commitment to the limit 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.139
 of hindsight 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.460
 unfastened all four feet number 10 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.169
 this is number 10 and entrusts well 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.880
 obviously to jean michel bazire it's a 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.990
 body feels good I want to say 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.370
 it's true that it's really 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.290
 commitment a little bit aimed also 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.700
 number 14 100 you can not find it 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.290
 eric raffin with whom he signed his 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.419
 better performance is more to do 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.830
 his evidence to vincennes and this time he 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.690
 will be four feet unshod what I 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.770
 retained which actually pushed me the 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.790
 retain it will be deferrée of the four 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.870
 feet which has not been the case since 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.860
 the previous winter meeting 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.840
 I think it was in March 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.889
 so logically again I 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.389
 think that the entourage has put all the 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.560
 assets on his side to be able to achieve 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.540
 a very good performance with 100gb 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.220
 tales you come to hear yards for 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.850
 to be able to contradict you on the way via 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.470
 asia 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.850
 if ever your place and I had 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.140
 had to make my predictions it would have been my 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.160
 surprise in surprise we are then 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.630
 that she has voice of game tips 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.370
 michel then events then these are 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.440
 two things that I like so that will be so 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.300
 if I do not want number 13 and the 3 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.590
 samurai paul father whom I placed in 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.390
 second and third positions my 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.039
 prognosis that I advise you in 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.410
 couple is placed for the greediest 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.830
 coupled winner never knows why gold 2 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.390
 out of 4 also very well listen michel 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.770
 thank you very much thank you to you go 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.750
 strongly on Saturday because we will have a 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.639
 superb canada would be exactly 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.710
 good very good weekend with of course the 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:02.389
 final of the gnt point 2 billion thank you 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.389
