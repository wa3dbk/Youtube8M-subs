00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.310
 there is only one way for companies 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.690
 construction was successful 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.010
 business 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.010
 management gains 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 the premier has developed and presents 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.020
 innovative solution for your company 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:26.440
 reduce costs increase profit evolve 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.650
 quality and speed up production 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.100
 sustainable building system is pri 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.190
 the most advanced construction technique in 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.890
 industrial scale was created to 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.500
 meet my house my life projects 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.830
 and blowing 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.620
 cdhu hotel and other projects 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.140
 business segments 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.910
 the system is revolutionary because it 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.010
 all the characteristics of a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.890
 conventional construction for the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.559
 final consumer but for construction company 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.010
 adds the advantages of lean production 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.010
 in scale 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.870
 what is the constructive system 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.300
 sustainable for me is the construction 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.300
 premier breaks paradigm of construction 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 vertically 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.030
 the masonry panels are executed 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.310
 horizontally reducing costs and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.860
 difficulty in hiring labor 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.880
 mainly from officers such as 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.880
 masons and carpenters 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.310
 each masonry panel consists of 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.250
 ceramic blocks seated on top of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.910
 mortar on both sides and structure in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.910
 reinforced concrete 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.970
 in this phase the pipes are already passed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.720
 electrical and hydraulic systems and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.630
 door and window openings easily 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.570
 the panels are 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.450
 1 to 1 and quickly the house is already 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.120
 fully assembled including the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.340
 slab placement 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.950
 to get an idea of ​​the reduction of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 costs and gain in agility with the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.380
 premier sustainable system can be 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.410
 built by day a design house 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.400
 my house my life with 43 meters 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.740
 squares 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.950
 using the service of ten workers 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.170
 being only two masons 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.510
 the system reduces to one-third the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.150
 quantity of skilled labor in the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.520
 construction site 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.270
 Another advantage is the reduction of 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.670
 work 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.660
 this work in the municipality of araçatuba 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.790
 to make 1200 houses being 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.290
 used a site under 5 thousand 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.690
 square meters 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.250
 if the set of houses were built 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.050
 in the conventional method 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.640
 the construction would be dispersed in more than 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.640
 480 thousand square meters 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.050
 the system is a developed innovation 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.540
 experienced by the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.180
 premier who created an exclusive 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.910
 technology based on principles 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.200
 sustainability social responsibility 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.870
 vision of partnership through various 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.400
 years of experience they brought to the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.380
 market this innovative method 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.209
 do not lose more business because of 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.330
 short delivery time 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.690
 decrease waste and losses on 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.150
 the improvement in industrial control 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.909
 provided by the system 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.769
 eliminate the financial costs incurred 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.099
 by the slow process of construction 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.049
 conventional to tab with headache 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.739
 to bring in labor 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.739
 qualified 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.500
 from now on 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.560
