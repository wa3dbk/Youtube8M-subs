00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.400
 good morning I'm mauro braga a speaker 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.859
 I will illustrate to you today at the Academia Fishman 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.619
 the solar panel system of 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.079
 fism to solar systems that can be 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.640
 solar thermal or photovoltaic but in 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.730
 particular today we see in solar 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.820
 thermal both flat and vacuum for 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.920
 plants, however, with forced circulation 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.219
 we have in detail to go and see 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 the finger on 200 t sp2 which is a collector 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.969
 with vacuum tubes that uses the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.010
 principle heatpipe therefore principle of 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.929
 so-called heat pipe that there 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.399
 allows maximum efficiency 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.010
 at maximum exploitation 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.649
 regarding irradiation it 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.960
 exploitation of solar radiation 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.970
 one of the interesting news and that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.220
 this collector despite being the type of 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.620
 file then as it was called circulation 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.590
 natural can work both in position 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.030
 vertical than in inclined position od 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.400
 horizontal then a maximum 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.470
 flexibility regarding his 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.940
 positioning choice not only for 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.710
 the installer but also for the art 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.140
 the architect himself who owes it 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.620
 integrate aesthetics into lines 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.360
 aesthetic of the building 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.850
 this is made possible by one of the many 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.500
 patents in particular sign this 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.080
 patent uses the so-called effect 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.330
 marangoni then the possibility through 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.250
 a particular internal processing of the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.250
 copper pipe that we see here 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 represented in the figure that allows us 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 to slide the liquid fluid into the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.990
 area in contact with the absorber towards 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 the part of the glass tube and then a 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.520
 a natural internal circulation also 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.830
 in a horizontal position exploiting 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.450
 precisely the so-called marangoni effect 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.520
 and this is what allows us to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.590
 have the possibility to install the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.690
 collector practically in all 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.830
 possible positions including any 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.860
 also integration into the roof for some 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.900
 the degree of vacuum created is important 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.550
 inside the vacuum tube why 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.140
 being very high it allows us to 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.150
 have some dispersion practically 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.220
 nothing but the big advantage of the tubes 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.660
 vacuum which therefore may have 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.790
 excellent efficiency and also with 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.430
 very high working temperatures o 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.290
 very cold external temperatures e 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.420
 for this reason it has also been treated 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.970
 the isolation is very detailed 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.190
 collector insulation two display cases 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.810
 that another fishman patent it 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.450
 collector two display cases that we see here 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.980
 represented in so-called stainless steel 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.100
 double tube as it can 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.880
 exploit the entire exchange surface 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.910
 of the tube exchanger vito on 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.580
 200 precisely heatpipe 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.380
 other fundamental peculiarity of the tube 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.570
 vacuum and what we said about 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.000
 to be able to be rotated and therefore to be able to 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.820
 allow maximum flexibility of 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.180
 installation that can be from 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.100
 classic installation on the roof pitch 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.350
 to installation on flat roofs up 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.880
 walls on free surfaces or even 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.739
 on the facade positioned so 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.690
 perfectly vertical that 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.970
 apparently it might seem like one 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.340
 solution not with maximum efficiency 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.640
 but taking advantage of just what was said 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.680
 possibility to rotate the single tube 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.180
 as we see represented in this 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.550
 image is as if we had 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.310
 actually installed the collector 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.170
 inclined while actually like 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.920
 aesthetic image and perfectly 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.140
 vertical is aligned to the wall of the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.150
 facade with large and advantage 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.709
 obviously as it was said for the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.420
 architects who can indulge 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.540
 together with the search for spaces if 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.030
 these said classics were not 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.830
 sufficient solar collectors go 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.370
 obviously integrated into what will be 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.350
 the complete solar system therefore with 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.000
 the integration by a second one 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.950
 source that can obviously be one 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.430
 wall-mounted boiler rather than floor-standing 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.260
 is a kettle or inertial accumulators for 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.190
 the eventual production of hot water 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.669
 health 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.440
 therefore we will have some adjustments with gods 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.609
 simple additional modules in the case 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.069
 of wall boilers rather 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.110
 breakfast dedicated regarding 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:28.389
 solar systems but they are anyway 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.159
 interfaced and therefore with the exchange 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.990
 data with the main setting of 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.060
 boiler to make a unique system 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.050
 integrated and therefore to rationalize to 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.719
 maximum the different functions ours 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.659
 adjustment as you see resumes that 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.159
 which is the classic adjustment of all 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.409
 the other schemes of all others 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.750
 therefore plants both with the boiler and 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.569
 with the solar system being managed 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.360
 in this example from the wall boiler e 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.909
 where able to evaluate and manage 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.129
 all parameters including production 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:04.409
 energy also on a daily basis 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.409
 it is obviously the total total 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.719
 precisely because the solutions are many and 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.849
 diversified we have a so-called 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:13.719
 diagram library consisting of more than one 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.789
 800 different solutions that can be 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.069
 viewed downloaded on our website 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.159
 internet at work under the search heading 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.080
 diagrams applications here we see some 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.389
 example are patterns that range from patterns 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.639
 and relatively simple like this one 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.370
 we can go to analyze with 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.349
 bivalent boiler wall-mounted boiler 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.110
 classic combined with the solar system e 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.270
 heating circuit management a 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.180
 decidedly more complex patterns more 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.440
 complexes that go instead to plants 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.449
 probably of higher power 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.779
 in fact we see a floor-standing boiler 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.089
 and no more moral than managing the circuits 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.069
 of the heating system 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:53.560
 production inertial storage 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:56.349
 health care alcalÃ  which provides the 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.330
 our solar collector both for what 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.400
 it concerns precisely the health care provider who 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.120
 the possible integration of the requirements 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.060
 so it's definitely heating 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.310
 a very complete range ranging from 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.020
 flat thermal solar collectors to those 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.900
 vacuum with maximum flexibility 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.029
 installation 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.860
 I therefore invite you to follow us on 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:21.449
 main social networks like facebook 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.449
 twitter slideshare 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.100
 the solar collector vito on 200 sp2 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.650
 as we see right now is 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.810
 positioned with the tubes horizontally 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.030
 taking advantage of the heatpipe principle 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.090
 with the patent whistle of possibility of 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.490
 horizontal positioning we see 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.190
 the input of the probe for the collectors 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.550
 which combined with the 22 forward pipes and 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.250
 return then goes to the kettle as far as 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.349
 regards the accumulation of energy the 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.590
 distribution manifold placed in 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:07:00.210
 top and easy to open and we can 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.389
 see right now completely 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.270
 open with insulation for the part of 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.729
 heat exchange here collector 2 tech 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.660
 so-called double-tube with the 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:16.610
 dry connection of the individual tubes 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.610
 vacuum for heat exchange 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.940
 we have the ability to rotate the 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.680
 single tube just to carry it 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.080
 optimally orient as 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.610
 inclination to optimize the 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.889
 collection of energy use 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.630
 solar available at various stages 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:32.630
 of the day and the seasons
