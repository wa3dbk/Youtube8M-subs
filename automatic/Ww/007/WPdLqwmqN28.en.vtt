00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.110
 inside the area he lifted the ball 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.050
 I juve it down and defined it before the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.330
 out of cannes and before the light and has 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.330
 greeted by those present 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.739
 did 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.340
 monclova - and red 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.620
 but it seems to me that everything starts in the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 Garcia's sequence does not threaten after 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 that hat so in an error on exit to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 the people of the sporting or are going to hit him 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.670
 asia sober after Revoredo and all 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 the world opens as if hitting him hard 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.170
 to the arch not intelligently garcía alén 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 you get this ball for angle and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.110
 this from the ground a ball that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.830
 I normally thought that I was dying I could not 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.070
 die the bad one after he strives three 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070
 of the pointer 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.900
 so nothing we handle it well and we are 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.790
 I think that scare winners tell us your 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.960
 goal 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.220
 good pass lucho garcía bueno lucho es 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.050
 this a genius for that I do not leave it there 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.880
 just to the side and the truth that I 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.100
 I'm staying well this world is 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.900
 fighting all the matches fighting 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 against monumental unne and now this 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.470
 victory also two wins in a row 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.140
 in another we're going game by game we 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 we have been we are a team that to that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.180
 come here is going to be difficult 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.590
 win them 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.500
 on Wednesday in moyobamba against 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.060
 trade we also had 22 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.040
 very difficult dates at the beginning and 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.409
 we have taken forward as to take 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.039
 all parties thank you thank you 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.780
 add 16 points yes sir the municipal t 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.490
 there's no up there will have to fight like 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.829
 always not the world and it seems to me that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.109
 I can see if there are few goal options in 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.539
 the arcs common and he found the goal 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.969
 about and about the end of the first time 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.080
 at an angle in a good move by Garcia 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:13.549
 as well said and bamboo as the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.549
 last week versus university 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.670
 he did not mess up he went out to play and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.709
 propose to crystal a match in the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.410
 mediaector crystal I think that it 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.870
 wrong to not correct in the second 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.480
 time to put people on the bands 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.150
 centralized the game facilitated the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.490
 ballots the encores and barriers were and 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.100
 the roof but those that practically 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.580
 they rejected everything by high 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.690
 in the middle good job of gazelle and a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.940
 barrier bag that ended up taking out 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.800
 all the balls and when those happened 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.110
 three appeared the importance it when 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.060
 the Gaul had a play the people of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.290
 sport before the crazy thin room girl 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.180
 an ervin ávila ball that was the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.980
 possible part for the sporting people 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.209
 but the thin madman ends up playing the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.370
 in hand to hand and ends up winning the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.100
 archer in conclusion it seems a 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.230
 ante party is more adapted to 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.050
 this type of field I do not fight it what 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.000
 he argued he came out he just faced the people 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.380
 of cut and end adding 3 together with your 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.570
 own mind the monitor and with two 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.070
 consecutive games demanding that the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.360
 absence of how well face went 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.610
 quiet the chirping melgar was created 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.160
 intelligently the South American knows 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.150
 handle his people because he put put leg 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.939
 cool entered 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.079
 this number 8 this one come to the cell 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.079
 works or works in the middle
