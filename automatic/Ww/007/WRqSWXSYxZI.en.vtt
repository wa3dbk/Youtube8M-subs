00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.119
 How is it possible for people to honor a king 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.890
 and at the same time profane his name? 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.330
 You know, it's not that the Jewish people saw a kind of fetish in the name, 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.830
 or that they believed there was something magical associated with the pronunciation of a 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.229
 word. 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.160
 But they understood this - as God understood it -, 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.830
 that if we have an indolent attitude, 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.859
 careless, 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.070
 towards the name of God, 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 that reveals more deeply than anything else we say 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.490
 our deepest attitude 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.280
 towards the God of that name. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.200
 I will say it clearly. 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.220
 If you use the name of God as a common grocer, 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.530
 You are a profane person to the core. 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.239
 You have no respect 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.450
 for the holiness of God, 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.560
 and I ask you to think 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 before 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.069
 that you miss that word 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.410
 again by your lips 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.990
 in a frivolous way, 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.520
 why God 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.730
 will not tolerate 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.110
 desecration 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.950
 of his name. He put it 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.390
 in the first place. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.590
 And that's why Jesus says 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 let's pray 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.440
 so that the name of God is holy, so that it is treated as something different, 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.890
 special, 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 extraordinary, 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.220
 higher, 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.509
 because he is different, 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.400
 and special, 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.229
 and superior. 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.890
 When we are called to be saints, 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.240
 We are called to be different. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.990
 we are called to give testimony of the style 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.759
 that we find in God, 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.560
 a style directed by the second meaning 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.580
 of holiness, 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.560
 What is justice? 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.629
 When God says, 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.220
 "Be holy, because I am holy," he is saying, "be different 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.500
 to the normal standard of this world. I want you to express and demonstrate 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.089
 what is sanctity 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.849
 on this earth. " 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.180
 That is the Christian's task, 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.450
 imitate 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.509
 and reflect 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.109
 the character of God 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.880
 towards an agonizing world.
