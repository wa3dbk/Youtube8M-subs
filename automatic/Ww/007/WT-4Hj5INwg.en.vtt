00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.240
 we are in a new video for the channel 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.250
 and this time we are in a new 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.289
 theory for minecraft because edition 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.520
 0.12 point 1 and 0.2 13.0 and now guys 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.009
 because I say that because one of the 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.290
 theories could be for the 9 more 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.270
 possibly and well the following is no 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.969
 I know if you add avui final or if you do not 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.940
 they add in to 0.13 I do not know if I'm going to 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.860
 understand but good the first theory 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.670
 that it would be maybe for the very 9 of the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.230
 zero point 12.1 would music be the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.820
 music is something like a kind of environment 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.290
 basically I do not know if there is one in which 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.000
 I have now 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.510
 You need to have a glass and a little more 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.820
 the volume 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 that is, the music of the environment depends 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.429
 of how the environment is more or less and 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.680
 good as you will see at the beginning they will see 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:09.810
 different music and so and good music 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 it's pretty good for those who do not know 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.070
 they get bored just hearing the sounds 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 from minecraft have a music then it is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.899
 very little more relaxing can be said 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.890
 and the next one that could be for the 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.509
 final or if it does not stop at 0.13 it would be the rest 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 they subtract it as you can see here the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.229
 we have here here is the dust of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.149
 rest but we can not put it 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.920
 basically because you can not yet 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.869
 the command is not added 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.840
 the rest but it could be for the very 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 end is week or if it could not be for 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.550
 the at 0.13 point 0 and well the next and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.510
 to finish would be what it would be 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.270

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.630
