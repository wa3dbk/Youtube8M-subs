together someday I don't know how many
inches<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.449> pressure<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.050> puts<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.529> but

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
inches of pressure this puts out but

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.750 
inches of pressure this puts out but
it's<00:00:24.199> made<00:00:25.199> by<00:00:25.380> British<00:00:25.439> Oregon<00:00:26.160> blowing<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it's made by British Oregon blowing it's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960 
it's made by British Oregon blowing it's
a<00:00:26.939> model<00:00:27.330> Bo<00:00:27.539> b3<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:29.429> thinking<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
a model Bo b3 so I'm thinking it's a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.709 
a model Bo b3 so I'm thinking it's a
three-inch<00:00:30.420> wind<00:00:30.720> pressure<00:00:31.550> see<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.420> motor

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
three-inch wind pressure see the motor

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.529 
three-inch wind pressure see the motor
how<00:00:36.719> many<00:00:36.960> horsepower<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.319 

I<00:00:42.570> can't<00:00:43.109> say<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> RPMs<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.289> 3450

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
I can't say but it's the RPMs are 3450

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's a single-phase 120 volts this thing

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.939 
it's a single-phase 120 volts this thing
is<00:01:01.110> an<00:01:01.199> absolute<00:01:01.379> beast<00:01:02.659> weighs<00:01:03.659> about<00:01:03.949> well

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is an absolute beast weighs about well

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.660 
is an absolute beast weighs about well
maybe<00:01:05.189> 200<00:01:05.759> pounds<00:01:06.649> so<00:01:07.649> quarter-inch<00:01:08.549> thick

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
maybe 200 pounds so quarter-inch thick

now<00:01:13.259> that<00:01:13.439> output<00:01:13.830> port<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> four<00:01:14.850> inch

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
now that output port is a four inch

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.460 
now that output port is a four inch
diameter<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.659> believe<00:01:17.960> see<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.259> plug

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
diameter I believe see if I can plug

00:01:19.470 --> 00:02:03.990 
diameter I believe see if I can plug
this<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:19.679> in

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.170 

thing<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:04.899> loud<00:02:05.110> without<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.920> wine<00:02:06.820> hook<00:02:07.030> up

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
thing is so loud without a wine hook up

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.360 
thing is so loud without a wine hook up
to<00:02:07.329> it
