welcome<00:00:00.719> back<00:00:00.870> settling<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.740> today's

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
welcome back settling here and today's

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.340 
welcome back settling here and today's
commandblock<00:00:03.240> contraption<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> all<00:00:04.140> about

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
commandblock contraption is all about

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.450 
commandblock contraption is all about
slimes<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.609> let's<00:00:05.759> go<00:00:05.879> ahead<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.060> spawn<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> few

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
slimes so let's go ahead and spawn a few

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.500 
slimes so let's go ahead and spawn a few
basically<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:08.849> done<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.210> command

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
basically what I've done with command

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.379 
basically what I've done with command
blocks<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.960> make<00:00:10.349> slime<00:00:10.849> spontaneously<00:00:11.849> split

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
blocks is make slime spontaneously split

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.839 
blocks is make slime spontaneously split
and<00:00:12.660> merge<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.200> each<00:00:13.349> other<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.309> one<00:00:14.580> we

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and merge with each other so that one we

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.609 
and merge with each other so that one we
got<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> slime<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.900> just<00:00:16.199> split<00:00:16.440> there's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
got it the slime that just split there's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.140 
got it the slime that just split there's
none<00:00:16.740> I'm<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> split<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.550> when<00:00:18.000> two

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
none I'm going to split and when two

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.760 
none I'm going to split and when two
slimes<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> same<00:00:18.990> size<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.590> close

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
slimes that are the same size get close

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279 
slimes that are the same size get close
to<00:00:19.920> each<00:00:19.980> other<00:00:20.390> they<00:00:21.390> will<00:00:21.570> merge<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.170> we

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
to each other they will merge like we

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.650 
to each other they will merge like we
just<00:00:22.439> saw<00:00:22.560> there<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.609> let's<00:00:24.029> add<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> few

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
just saw there and so let's add in a few

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
just saw there and so let's add in a few
more<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.800> more<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.340> them<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
more because the more there are them the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880 
more because the more there are them the
more<00:00:27.240> often<00:00:27.630> they'll<00:00:27.779> merge<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.410> split<00:00:28.769> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
more often they'll merge and split and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.939 
more often they'll merge and split and
stuff<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> big<00:00:30.420> slimes<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
stuff get a lot of big slimes and so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
stuff get a lot of big slimes and so
when<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:32.820> two<00:00:33.000> slimes<00:00:33.239> they're<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> same

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
when when two slimes they're the same

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
when when two slimes they're the same
size<00:00:33.840> merge<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.710> become<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> slime<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
size merge they become a slime of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.440 
size merge they become a slime of the
next<00:00:35.880> size<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.469> split<00:00:38.059> they<00:00:39.059> go

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
next size up and when they split they go

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.869 
next size up and when they split they go
from<00:00:39.690> being<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.379> slime<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.100> two<00:00:41.280> slimes<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
from being one slime to two slimes of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.650 
from being one slime to two slimes of
the<00:00:42.059> next<00:00:42.270> size<00:00:42.450> down<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.570> pretty

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the next size down and so it's pretty

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
the next size down and so it's pretty
much<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> works<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.340> reason<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.700> was

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
much how it works and the reason I was

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
much how it works and the reason I was
doing<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.899> try<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.350> lava

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
doing this was to try and make a lava

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.049 
doing this was to try and make a lava
lamp<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.280> we'll<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.489> over<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.000> I'll

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
lamp and so we'll go over here and I'll

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.510 
lamp and so we'll go over here and I'll
show<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> did<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.649> don't<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.460> it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
show you what I did I don't think it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.630 
show you what I did I don't think it
works<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:53.760> well<00:00:54.020> it<00:00:55.020> works<00:00:55.230> okay<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.370> there

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
works very well it works okay but there

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.110 
works very well it works okay but there
is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> problem<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.600> let's<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.940> summon<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
is a problem and let's see summon a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.779 
is a problem and let's see summon a
slime<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:01.469> ten<00:01:01.770> blocks<00:01:02.070> below<00:01:02.309> my<00:01:02.579> feet

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
slime about ten blocks below my feet

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
slime about ten blocks below my feet
okay<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> slime<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.290> he<00:01:04.830> starts

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
okay so we got a slime there he starts

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.359 
okay so we got a slime there he starts
floating<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> surface<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.159> over<00:01:08.159> time

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
floating up to the surface and over time

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.560 
floating up to the surface and over time
he's<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> start

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
he's going to start

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
he's going to start
well<00:01:10.170> he<00:01:10.409> might<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.890> might<00:01:11.070> split

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
well he might this one might split

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
well he might this one might split
actually<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.260> bigger<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.860> no<00:01:14.100> he

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
actually this is a bigger one no he

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
actually this is a bigger one no he
starts<00:01:14.460> sinking<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.720> well<00:01:16.140> he<00:01:16.320> started

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
starts sinking here so well he started

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.810 
starts sinking here so well he started
sinking<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> second<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.520> he<00:01:17.580> turned

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
sinking for a second and then he turned

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
sinking for a second and then he turned
into<00:01:17.939> smaller<00:01:18.210> ones<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.930> guys<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.229> going

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
into smaller ones these guys are going

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.260 
into smaller ones these guys are going
to<00:01:19.409> start<00:01:19.619> sinking<00:01:19.979> basically<00:01:20.640> whenever<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to start sinking basically whenever a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
to start sinking basically whenever a
slime<00:01:21.689> splits<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.350> starts<00:01:22.619> floating<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.009> when

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
slime splits it starts floating and when

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
slime splits it starts floating and when
it<00:01:23.250> hasn't<00:01:23.610> split<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> while<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.540> start

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it hasn't split for a while to start

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
it hasn't split for a while to start
sinking<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.009> guys<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.520> never

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
sinking and so these guys can never

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.649 
sinking and so these guys can never
split<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.240> they're<00:01:27.360> already<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
split because they're already the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.280 
split because they're already the
smallest<00:01:27.869> size<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.770> let's<00:01:28.950> start<00:01:29.100> sinking<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
smallest size so let's start sinking and

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.539 
smallest size so let's start sinking and
okay<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.159> might<00:01:32.280> merge

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
okay but and then they might merge

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
okay but and then they might merge
eventually<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.390> they'll<00:01:33.750> start

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
eventually and then they'll start

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.910 
eventually and then they'll start
floating<00:01:35.009> again<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.659> think<00:01:36.659> anyway<00:01:37.380> let's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
floating again I think anyway let's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.149 
floating again I think anyway let's
let's<00:01:38.640> summon<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.210> slimes<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.890> turns

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
let's summon some more slimes it turns

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.350 
let's summon some more slimes it turns
out<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.759> whole<00:01:41.939> system<00:01:42.090> actually

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
out this this whole system actually

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999 
out this this whole system actually
works<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.810> okay

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
works out okay

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.310 
works out okay
it<00:01:44.369> actually<00:01:44.670> looks<00:01:44.970> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.570> lava

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it actually looks kind of like a lava

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
it actually looks kind of like a lava
lamp<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.390> wax

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
lamp you know where you have that wax

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.010 
lamp you know where you have that wax
stuff<00:01:49.320> constantly<00:01:50.540> splitting<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.990> merging

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
stuff constantly splitting and merging

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
stuff constantly splitting and merging
because<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.040> kind<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> liquid<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
because it's kind of a liquid but it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.459 
because it's kind of a liquid but it
likes<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.729> next<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> other<00:01:57.090> wax<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.290> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
likes to be next to other wax and so it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
likes to be next to other wax and so it
kind<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.860> merges<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.460> wax<00:01:59.670> sometimes

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
kind of merges with other wax sometimes

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999 
kind of merges with other wax sometimes
but<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:00.990> different<00:02:01.259> temperatures<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
but there are different temperatures and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
but there are different temperatures and
they<00:02:02.100> split<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> sometimes<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.540> sink<00:02:03.810> in

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
they split and sometimes they sink in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
they split and sometimes they sink in
times<00:02:04.170> sometimes<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.799> rise<00:02:05.009> let's<00:02:05.549> add<00:02:05.700> even

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
times sometimes they rise let's add even

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.440 
times sometimes they rise let's add even
more<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.270> want<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:06.960> more<00:02:07.170> than<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:08.300> but<00:02:09.300> there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
more I want way more than this but there

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.940 
more I want way more than this but there
is<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> problem<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.440> problem<00:02:10.470> comes

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
is a problem and the problem comes

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
is a problem and the problem comes
basically<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:12.239> two<00:02:12.540> slimes<00:02:12.780> merge

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
basically when two slimes merge

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
basically when two slimes merge
and<00:02:13.590> they're<00:02:14.070> at<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> top<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.790> lava<00:02:14.940> lamp

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and they're at the top of the lava lamp

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.510 
and they're at the top of the lava lamp
here<00:02:15.510> because<00:02:16.320> when<00:02:16.560> two<00:02:16.680> slimes<00:02:16.950> merge<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
here because when two slimes merge to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.820 
here because when two slimes merge to
become<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:18.000> slime<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.600> next<00:02:18.810> size<00:02:18.990> up<00:02:19.200> all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
become a slime of the next size up all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.870 
become a slime of the next size up all
right<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.100> should<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.400> pretty<00:02:20.520> good<00:02:20.640> and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
right that should be pretty good and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.970 
right that should be pretty good and
when<00:02:21.840> they<00:02:21.930> become<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.350> slime<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.800> next

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
when they become a slime of the next

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.420 
when they become a slime of the next
size<00:02:23.100> up<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:24.000> slime<00:02:24.210> can<00:02:24.390> actually<00:02:24.690> kind<00:02:24.930> of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
size up that slime can actually kind of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.850 
size up that slime can actually kind of
clip<00:02:26.430> into<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> walls<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.590> sometimes<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
clip into the walls and sometimes the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.770 
clip into the walls and sometimes the
slimes<00:02:29.130> will<00:02:29.340> actually<00:02:29.640> escape<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
slimes will actually escape from the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.930 
slimes will actually escape from the
lava<00:02:30.959> lamp<00:02:31.320> which<00:02:31.920> obviously<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:32.790> not

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
lava lamp which obviously that's not

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.380 
lava lamp which obviously that's not
something<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.300> want<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.630> lava<00:02:33.810> lamp<00:02:33.990> but

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
something you want in a lava lamp but

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.550 
something you want in a lava lamp but
let's<00:02:36.390> see<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.810> some<00:02:37.140> stuff<00:02:37.410> that's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
let's see we have some stuff that's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.830 
let's see we have some stuff that's
floating<00:02:38.010> some<00:02:38.280> stuff<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.670> sinking<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:39.570> we

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
floating some stuff is sinking here we

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.020 
floating some stuff is sinking here we
get<00:02:39.990> new<00:02:40.230> stuff<00:02:40.500> floating<00:02:40.800> new<00:02:41.340> stuff<00:02:41.580> sinking

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
get new stuff floating new stuff sinking

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.110 
get new stuff floating new stuff sinking
and<00:02:42.709> yeah<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.740> mean<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.459> doesn't<00:02:44.910> quite<00:02:45.060> look

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
and yeah I mean it doesn't quite look

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.850 
and yeah I mean it doesn't quite look
like<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.390> lot<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.690> lamp<00:02:45.840> obviously<00:02:46.320> lava<00:02:46.530> lamps

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
like a lot of lamp obviously lava lamps

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.130 
like a lot of lamp obviously lava lamps
have<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> very<00:02:47.340> fluid<00:02:47.760> behavior<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.239> them<00:02:48.390> but

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
have a very fluid behavior to them but

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.280 
have a very fluid behavior to them but
you<00:02:49.500> get<00:02:49.860> sort<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> same<00:02:50.580> idea<00:02:51.050> where<00:02:52.050> you

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
you get sort of the same idea where you

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.520 
you get sort of the same idea where you
have<00:02:52.320> pieces<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:54.120> constantly<00:02:55.020> merging

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
have pieces that are constantly merging

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.940 
have pieces that are constantly merging
and<00:02:55.890> splitting<00:02:56.580> from<00:02:57.420> each<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.050> rising

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and splitting from each other and rising

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.530 
and splitting from each other and rising
and<00:02:59.100> falling<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.670> think<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.970> need<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.270> pieces

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and falling I think I need more pieces

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.960 
and falling I think I need more pieces
so<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.320> there's<00:03:01.739> more<00:03:01.830> emerging<00:03:02.520> happening

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so that there's more emerging happening

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.160 
so that there's more emerging happening
and<00:03:03.300> we<00:03:03.390> refer<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.660> look<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:03.900> bit<00:03:04.050> better

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and we refer to look a little bit better

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.990 
and we refer to look a little bit better
so<00:03:04.410> let's<00:03:04.530> add<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.980> more<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.790> kind<00:03:05.880> of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
so let's add a you more just kind of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
so let's add a you more just kind of
moving<00:03:06.150> around<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.470> things

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
moving around as I do it so that things

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.840 
moving around as I do it so that things
won't<00:03:08.430> merge<00:03:08.640> instantaneously<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.790> then

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
won't merge instantaneously and then

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.120 
won't merge instantaneously and then
let's<00:03:12.239> take<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> look<00:03:12.600> just<00:03:13.560> watch<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
let's take a look just watch it for a

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.550 
let's take a look just watch it for a
few<00:03:14.310> seconds<00:03:14.670> yeah<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.540> mean<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.900> looks<00:03:16.230> it

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
few seconds yeah I mean it looks it

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.110 
few seconds yeah I mean it looks it
looks<00:03:16.680> kind<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:16.980> pleasing<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.489> wish<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> water

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
looks kind of pleasing I wish the water

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.640 
looks kind of pleasing I wish the water
was<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.360> little<00:03:18.630> bit<00:03:18.750> more<00:03:18.840> transparent<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.620> we

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
was a little bit more transparent so we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.810 
was a little bit more transparent so we
could<00:03:19.860> see<00:03:20.070> these<00:03:20.220> things<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.580> little<00:03:20.640> bit

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
could see these things a little bit

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.370 
could see these things a little bit
better<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.840> water<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.200> definitely

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
better but the water is definitely

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.009 
better but the water is definitely
necessary<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.519> things<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.120> float<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
necessary so that things can float and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.420 
necessary so that things can float and
things<00:03:25.769> can<00:03:26.010> sink<00:03:27.440> yeah<00:03:28.440> well<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:29.160> nice<00:03:29.370> that

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
things can sink yeah well it's nice that

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.580 
things can sink yeah well it's nice that
not<00:03:29.760> notice<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.870> none<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.290> slimes

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
not notice that that none of the slimes

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.050 
not notice that that none of the slimes
have<00:03:31.890> escaped<00:03:32.250> from<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.580> lava<00:03:32.760> lamp

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
have escaped from the lava lamp

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.759 
have escaped from the lava lamp
definitely<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.600> my<00:03:33.630> testing<00:03:34.140> they<00:03:34.320> did<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> lot

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
definitely in my testing they did a lot

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.650 
definitely in my testing they did a lot
but<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.880> was<00:03:35.970> probably<00:03:36.180> over<00:03:36.360> longer

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
but that was probably over longer

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.020 
but that was probably over longer
periods<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:37.170> time<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.620> probably<00:03:38.489> also<00:03:38.910> with

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
periods of time and probably also with

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.030 
periods of time and probably also with
more<00:03:39.239> slimes<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.720> there<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.410> that's<00:03:40.799> kind<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
more slimes in there but that's kind of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.319 
more slimes in there but that's kind of
the<00:03:41.160> lava<00:03:41.340> lamp<00:03:41.580> effect<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.000> was<00:03:42.120> going

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
the lava lamp effect that I was going

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.449 
the lava lamp effect that I was going
for<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.350> I'm<00:03:43.560> glad<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.829> could<00:03:43.980> show<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
for so I'm glad I could show you in a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.630 
for so I'm glad I could show you in a
video<00:03:45.079> but<00:03:46.079> it's<00:03:46.530> kind<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.799> cool<00:03:46.980> cool<00:03:47.310> idea

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
video but it's kind of a cool cool idea

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.699 
video but it's kind of a cool cool idea
I<00:03:48.000> think<00:03:48.780> there's<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.140> reason<00:03:49.410> why<00:03:49.440> they

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
I think there's a good reason why they

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.180 
I think there's a good reason why they
don't<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.700> know<00:03:50.760> merge<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:52.019> game<00:03:52.200> because

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
don't you know merge in the game because

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.460 
don't you know merge in the game because
if<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.610> like<00:03:54.019> let's<00:03:55.019> let<00:03:55.200> me<00:03:55.260> grab<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
if you have like let's let me grab a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.300 
if you have like let's let me grab a
sword<00:03:56.840> well<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.350> could<00:03:58.709> maybe<00:03:58.829> make<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> work

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
sword well you could maybe make it work

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.259 
sword well you could maybe make it work
if<00:03:59.630> well<00:04:00.630> okay<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.079> when<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.350> kill<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.620> slime

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
if well okay so when I kill this slime

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.400 
if well okay so when I kill this slime
several<00:04:03.269> slimes<00:04:03.540> will<00:04:03.720> pop<00:04:03.870> out<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.170> could<00:04:04.320> be

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
several slimes will pop out it could be

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.729 
several slimes will pop out it could be
up<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.560> four<00:04:05.450> in<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.540> case<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:07.230> don't<00:04:07.440> think<00:04:07.709> I

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
up to four in this case I don't think I

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.560 
up to four in this case I don't think I
actually<00:04:07.799> killed<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.250> one<00:04:08.400> let's<00:04:09.390> try

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
actually killed that one let's try

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.460 
actually killed that one let's try
killing<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:09.959> one<00:04:10.820> okay<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.180> don't<00:04:13.079> know<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.410> I

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
killing this one okay I don't know if I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.569 
killing this one okay I don't know if I
killed<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.799> one<00:04:13.920> either<00:04:14.040> problem<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.489> they

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
killed that one either problem is they

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.380 
killed that one either problem is they
have<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.700> lot<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.850> hit<00:04:14.970> points<00:04:15.000> when<00:04:15.269> they're

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
have a lot of hit points when they're

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.969 
have a lot of hit points when they're
big<00:04:15.540> okay<00:04:15.959> how<00:04:16.260> about<00:04:16.440> this<00:04:16.590> I'll<00:04:16.799> kill<00:04:16.950> a

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
big okay how about this I'll kill a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.340 
big okay how about this I'll kill a
smaller<00:04:17.250> one<00:04:17.430> and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
smaller one and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.040 
smaller one and
they<00:04:18.740> can<00:04:19.100> turn<00:04:19.310> into<00:04:19.459> four<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:19.970> then<00:04:20.480> those

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
they can turn into four and then those

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.570 
they can turn into four and then those
can<00:04:21.260> merge<00:04:21.380> with<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.800> later<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.430> end

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
can merge with you later and so you end

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.060 
can merge with you later and so you end
up<00:04:22.640> with<00:04:22.700> kind<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.090> s'more<00:04:23.480> slime<00:04:23.960> mass<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.590> so

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
up with kind of s'more slime mass and so

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.470 
up with kind of s'more slime mass and so
you'd<00:04:25.190> have<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.580> in<00:04:25.940> order<00:04:26.090> for<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.420> to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
you'd have to in order for this to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.860 
you'd have to in order for this to
really<00:04:26.660> work<00:04:26.960> in<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.240> vanilla<00:04:29.540> game

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
really work in the in the vanilla game

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.050 
really work in the in the vanilla game
you<00:04:30.590> would<00:04:30.710> have<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.010> have<00:04:31.190> only<00:04:31.520> two<00:04:31.790> slimes

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
you would have to have only two slimes

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.920 
you would have to have only two slimes
pop<00:04:32.300> out<00:04:32.480> when<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:33.080> slime<00:04:33.770> dies<00:04:34.630> otherwise<00:04:35.630> you

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
pop out when a slime dies otherwise you

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.480 
pop out when a slime dies otherwise you
end<00:04:35.960> up<00:04:36.140> with<00:04:36.200> just<00:04:36.590> more<00:04:36.890> and<00:04:37.040> more<00:04:37.100> slimes

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
end up with just more and more slimes

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.170 
end up with just more and more slimes
all<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.760> time

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
all the time

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.580 
all the time
also<00:04:38.660> retelling<00:04:39.020> their<00:04:39.140> hit<00:04:39.230> points<00:04:39.260> it's<00:04:39.560> not

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
also retelling their hit points it's not

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.660 
also retelling their hit points it's not
really<00:04:39.830> balanced<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.280> vanilla<00:04:40.550> game

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
really balanced for the vanilla game

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.520 
really balanced for the vanilla game
mostly<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.630> just<00:04:41.660> did<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:41.990> because<00:04:42.140> I<00:04:42.200> wanted<00:04:42.320> to

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
mostly I just did it because I wanted to

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.070 
mostly I just did it because I wanted to
make<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.680> lava<00:04:42.860> lamp<00:04:43.070> which<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.750> don't<00:04:44.990> know

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
make a lava lamp which I I don't know

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.830 
make a lava lamp which I I don't know
kind<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.620> succeeded<00:04:46.040> in<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.250> guess<00:04:46.840> anyway

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
kind of succeeded in I guess anyway

00:04:47.840 --> 00:05:02.780 
kind of succeeded in I guess anyway
that's<00:04:48.680> about<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.980> thanks<00:04:49.280> for<00:04:49.310> watching

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.850 

you
