00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.500
 My name is Michel Garcia and I am from here 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.050
 of zacatecas this 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:17.290
 I started nationwide at 9 years 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.200
 my brother was the one who instilled in me good 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.800
 from my dad mainly this from the 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.939
 charrería was what 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 the one that involved us this national sport 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.829
 As my brother is the coach, be him 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.899
 was the one that got me and then I from 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.000
 Little girl I do I liked the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.309
 horses that took me to the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.309
 charreadas my dream was always so 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.860
 is in a skirmish and the beauty of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.909
 team is that always be 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.129
 united despite conflicts or what 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.140
 we always find the way to 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.000
 solve some problem I feel that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.199
 is what I like most about this team 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.820
 there's a lot of connection a lot of connection that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.980
 it has to do with both horses 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.510
 as with the compañeras 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.990
 this one has to be very concentrated 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.340
 and will leave out 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.640
 all public noise music one being 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.649
 you do not hear anything, they listen to me and the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.590
 music that they say is very strong and 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.280
 you do not listen to him there's a lot of connection with 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.190
 the team 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.380
 in a visual way because obviously 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.740
 They do not listen to us either, it's like 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.290
 voices the sounds and then we spent 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.210
 visually we communicate visually 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.580
 yes you have to have connection with the horse 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.070
 and then there you have to know what he 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.370
 the horse knows you 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.330
 If you have to consent, do not do it anymore because 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:55.150
 there are times that this one becomes clowns 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.820
 therefore with follow-up but there is no 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.930
 that mistreat them so that there 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.890
 connection then if you have to then I do not know 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.750
 always after a workout 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.440
 cool it and let the horse know you 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.870
 walk with him have that connection for 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.080
 example at the moment of the gallop feel it 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.580
 feel as your gallop flows 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.870
 and that is very very father is very father then 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.710
 and zacatecas to speak so the anthem of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.470
 the 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.040
 or to start a charreada is like 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.040
 zacatecas apart from that here in 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.620
 zacatecas what has excelled most are 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.920
 the skirmishes that Zacatecas have put 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.400
 in high level of skirmishes is what 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.370
 that has excelled up here tecar this 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.090
 is what he tells me I'm from Zacatecas 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.090
 smooth and tuitán
