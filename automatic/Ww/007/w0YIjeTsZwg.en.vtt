00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
side of every bite that I had

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.720 
side of every bite that I had
and<00:02:18.090> dip<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.240> meanest<00:02:19.660> like<00:02:19.840> special<00:02:20.200> sauce

bean sprouts sauteed green bean sprouts
and<00:02:32.110> then<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.010> think<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:33.670> were<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:35.170> were

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
and then I think they were they were

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.500 
and then I think they were they were
almost<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.770> really<00:02:36.490> thinly<00:02:36.880> sliced

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
almost like really thinly sliced

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.890 
almost like really thinly sliced
mushrooms<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:39.130> think<00:02:39.490> they<00:02:40.450> kind<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.750> taste

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
mushrooms I think they kind of taste

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.750 
mushrooms I think they kind of taste
like<00:02:41.080> potato<00:02:41.410> chips<00:02:41.470> but<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:41.980> know<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.490> they

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
like potato chips but I know that they

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.670 
like potato chips but I know that they
weren't<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.110> think<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.410> they<00:02:44.560> were

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
weren't so I think that they were

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.620 
weren't so I think that they were
actually<00:02:44.770> mushroom<00:02:45.370> tops<00:02:45.610> oh<00:02:45.850> that's<00:02:46.420> what<00:02:46.600> it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
actually mushroom tops oh that's what it

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.390 
actually mushroom tops oh that's what it
was<00:02:46.810> um<00:02:47.110> with<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.280> live<00:02:49.030> shrimp<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:50.400> she'll

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
was um with the live shrimp and she'll

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.630 
was um with the live shrimp and she'll
stuff<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:52.480> was<00:02:53.050> mushrooms<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.310> then<00:02:54.840> slice<00:02:56.640> of

like reconstituted fish in a form or it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.500

could<00:03:14.530> be<00:03:14.680> some<00:03:15.070> kind<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.310> fuel<00:03:15.760> or<00:03:16.000> squid<00:03:16.300> I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
could be some kind of fuel or squid I

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.020 
could be some kind of fuel or squid I
have<00:03:16.660> no<00:03:16.810> idea<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:17.650> good<00:03:17.800> too<00:03:18.030> and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
have no idea but it was good too and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.500 
have no idea but it was good too and
then<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.500> slice<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.860> cucumber<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.360> then

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
back to the with steak so the bean

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.260 
back to the with steak so the bean
sprouts<00:03:26.920> mushrooms<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.790> would<00:03:28.000> have<00:03:28.120> deep
