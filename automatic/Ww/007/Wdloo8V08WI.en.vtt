00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.400
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.710
 How to make these beautiful Mamluks 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.049
 complete which we can give for 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.789
 baby shower either child or girl 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.220
 Well, I'm going to show you the 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.660
 materials that we are going to need 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.190
 we will occupy two pieces of foami in the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.680
 color we are going to make the distinctive 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.910
 as well as the molds which are the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.250
 I leave on my blog if you like 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.530
 download them the link I leave in the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.110
 description box too 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.100
 we will take scissors a skewer stick 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.469
 to mark our molds 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.500
 a marker to blur what is 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.329
 around silicon whether hot or cold 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.760
 or any other type of glue that 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.250
 you like to use also 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.829
 we will take acrylic paint to make 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.199
 what are the dots and we will occupy 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.629
 also four little circles of these 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.399
 they are from foami also these previously 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.619
 I cut them with what is this 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.780
 drilling machine since it is very easy to 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.110
 do it this way well then let's go 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.030
 to start 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.440
 mark our molds on what is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.810
 the foam and here previously I already did 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.670
 to save a little bit of time like this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.670
 that now you just have to cut it 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 once we have our pieces 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 cut out what we're going to do is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.070
 blur it with what is the marker 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.070
 pink 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.600
 let's pass it on to everything that is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.750
 around and we are going to blur it with 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.840
 a piece of cloth or a washcloth 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.240
 like this one that is a wet wipe and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.010
 well let's go then start doing it 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.320
 or we can do it simply with 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.009
 the finger as I have shown them in others 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.009
 tutorials 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.730
 Once we have it, we are going to 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.150
 mark this part very well where they are 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.360
 like the folds that he has here in what 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.950
 that they would be like type the shoes 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.590
 to give it a better look because it's nicer 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.690
 to what is the figure of the Mamluk and what 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.170
 here we are going to mark you a little bit 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.280
 plus 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.280
 the corners 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 and look like that, it will look much better 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.530
 and well now let's do the same with 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.069
 what is the neck and what will be the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.049
 sleeve cuffs 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.939
 here in the first steps of the sleeves nothing 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.150
 so we're going to put what is 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.150
 around 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.360
 and nothing else above is very light 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.360
 what we are going to put on the color pink 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.680
 here in this part we are going to do what 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.299
 same 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.760
 we are going to place the painting or the 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.400
 marker to color the chimera in the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.290
 downstairs 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.000
 so that the time we paste it is not 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.000
 note what white in this part 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.000
 and we will stay like this now yes we are going to 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.740
 pass around each olÃ¡n that has 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.740
 here to mark it a little better 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.629
 we mark in each of the solitates a 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.590
 little bit more up so that 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.590
 make as a hello type 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.680
 it will stay like this 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.460
 now with our skewer stick 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.639
 let's mark a hairline right in 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.639
 medium 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.399
 not very strong we make a soft and 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.499
 after nothing else we spend like this our 

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:41.769
 finger to be marked too 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.769
 gently 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:48.509
 and we will have stayed like this now we are going to 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.509
 start to stick the pieces 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.590
 now finally we're just going to 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.050
 place what are the buttons and the 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.050
 little white spots with acrylic paint 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.750
 and so we will be left with even better 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.310
 now with the same stick of the skewer 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.169
 let's go marking what are the 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.169
 little white spots with paint 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.930
 and go look how nice it has been already 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.930
 our finished romper 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.520
 good friends, I hope this is 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.620
 craftsmanship has been to your liking if it was 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.270
 so they share her finger up and 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.419
 see you in the next tutorial up 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.419
 then
