00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
video on smoothing parts but how do you

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.540 
video on smoothing parts but how do you
set<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.389> shell<00:00:15.630> thickness<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.440> blender<00:00:16.800> well

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
set the shell thickness and blender well

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.950 
set the shell thickness and blender well
that's<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.789> great<00:00:17.910> question<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.660> gonna<00:00:18.750> go

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
video so in the last video I showed how

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.630 
video so in the last video I showed how
to<00:00:24.060> smooth<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.900> lower<00:00:25.140> jaw<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.310> went

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
to smooth out this lower jaw and I went

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.710 
to smooth out this lower jaw and I went
ahead<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.820> printed<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> turned<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.480> pretty

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
ahead and printed it turned out pretty

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.150 
ahead and printed it turned out pretty
well<00:00:27.810> I'll<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.439> another<00:00:28.590> video<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.039> later

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
well I'll do another video on that later

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
well I'll do another video on that later
well<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> will<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.420> ahead<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
well I will go ahead and get right to it

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.010 
well I will go ahead and get right to it
how<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.489> set<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.030> thickness<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> piece

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
how do you set the thickness of a piece

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.639 
how do you set the thickness of a piece
as<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.469> talked<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.489> previous<00:00:35.700> video<00:00:36.649> if

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
as I talked about in a previous video if

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.819 
as I talked about in a previous video if
you<00:00:37.800> pull<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> mesh<00:00:38.940> from<00:00:39.629> pepakura<00:00:40.530> file

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
you pull in a mesh from pepakura file

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
you pull in a mesh from pepakura file
this<00:00:41.250> helmet<00:00:41.670> from<00:00:41.760> our<00:00:42.149> blue<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.510> for

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this helmet from our blue one for

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
this helmet from our blue one for
example<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.950> no<00:00:44.070> thickness<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.730> it's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
example there is no thickness to it it's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
example there is no thickness to it it's
basically<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.530> sheet<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> paper<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
basically just the sheet of paper the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
basically just the sheet of paper the
geometry<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> inside<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> exactly

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
geometry on the inside here is exactly

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
geometry on the inside here is exactly
the<00:00:49.410> geometry<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> outside<00:00:50.660> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> go

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the geometry on the outside if you go

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
the geometry on the outside if you go
ahead<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> wireframe<00:00:52.739> view<00:00:53.039> you'll

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
ahead and go to wireframe view you'll

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.900 
ahead and go to wireframe view you'll
see<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.270> single<00:00:55.430> wireframe<00:00:56.430> mesh

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
see it's just a single wireframe mesh

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.170 
see it's just a single wireframe mesh
okay<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:59.039> we'll<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.340> ahead<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
okay so what we'll go ahead and do is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
okay so what we'll go ahead and do is
add<00:01:00.390> some<00:01:00.420> thickness<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
add some thickness so if we go back in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.230 
add some thickness so if we go back in
here<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.430> look<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> solid<00:01:03.030> okay<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
here and look at the solid okay and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.280 
here and look at the solid okay and
we'll<00:01:06.240> go<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.869> side<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we'll go over to the right side of the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
we'll go over to the right side of the
screen<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.400> menu<00:01:08.580> here

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
screen and there's this little menu here

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
screen and there's this little menu here
with<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.600> wrench<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.260> click<00:01:10.409> on

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
with a little wrench on it you click on

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
with a little wrench on it you click on
that<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> add<00:01:11.280> modifier<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.810> down

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that you go to add modifier and down

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.160 
that you go to add modifier and down
here<00:01:13.350> under<00:01:13.619> generate<00:01:14.070> there's<00:01:14.840> solidify<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here under generate there's solidify you

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.960 
here under generate there's solidify you
click<00:01:16.409> solidify<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.369> gives<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
click solidify and that gives you this

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.280 
click solidify and that gives you this
solidify<00:01:18.780> modifier

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
solidify modifier

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.080 
solidify modifier
okay<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> default<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.790> gonna<00:01:20.939> give

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
okay the default in here is gonna give

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.050 
okay the default in here is gonna give
you<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> thickness<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.810> point<00:01:22.350> zero<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:23.400> now

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you a thickness of point zero one now

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.200 
you a thickness of point zero one now
I've<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.360> units<00:01:24.780> set<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.650> as

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
I've got units set in here as

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.149 
I've got units set in here as
millimeters<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.990> obviously<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.799> that's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
millimeters so obviously that's that's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.580 
millimeters so obviously that's that's
pretty<00:01:29.490> thin<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:29.970> too<00:01:30.210> thin<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
pretty thin that's too thin so what I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
pretty thin that's too thin so what I
did<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.220> pieces<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.880> I'll<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
did for the other pieces and I'll do it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.399 
did for the other pieces and I'll do it
here<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.750> went<00:01:33.900> ahead<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> set<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
here is I just went ahead and set a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
here is I just went ahead and set a
thickness<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.040> three<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:36.030> before<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
thickness of three now before I do that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.819 
thickness of three now before I do that
I<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> point<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> couple<00:01:37.259> things<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
I want to point out a couple things and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
I want to point out a couple things and
you'll<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.159> you'll<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.490> what's<00:01:39.420> gonna

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you'll see you'll see what's gonna

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.090 
you'll see you'll see what's gonna
happen<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:42.020> whenever<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.500> areas<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
happen here whenever you have areas of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.359 
happen here whenever you have areas of
your<00:01:44.549> model<00:01:45.030> such<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.990> groove<00:01:46.409> okay

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
your model such as this groove okay

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
your model such as this groove okay
that's<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.110> groove<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that's right here see this groove that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.120 
that's right here see this groove that
was<00:01:49.649> modeled<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.939> small<00:01:51.869> thin<00:01:52.350> areas<00:01:52.890> like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
was modeled in and small thin areas like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.870 
was modeled in and small thin areas like
that<00:01:53.540> really<00:01:54.540> thin<00:01:55.040> detail<00:01:56.040> areas<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.610> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
that really thin detail areas like this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.530 
that really thin detail areas like this
here<00:01:57.390> where<00:01:57.570> you've<00:01:57.689> got<00:01:58.640> faces<00:01:59.640> underneath

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
here where you've got faces underneath

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.109 
here where you've got faces underneath
and<00:02:01.049> faces<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.159> top<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.790> are<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:02.969> close

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and faces on top that are in close

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
and faces on top that are in close
proximity<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:04.229> still<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.920> still<00:02:05.130> want<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
proximity you still you still want to

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
proximity you still you still want to
maintain<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.880> geometry<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.810> print

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
maintain that geometry in your print

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.860 
maintain that geometry in your print
okay

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
okay

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.400 
okay
but<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.010> start<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.400> apply<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> thickness

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
but when you start to apply a thickness

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.240 
but when you start to apply a thickness
blender<00:02:11.410> doesn't<00:02:11.590> know<00:02:11.770> that<00:02:11.950> that's<00:02:12.100> what

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
blender doesn't know that that's what

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.560 
blender doesn't know that that's what
you<00:02:12.280> want<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.610> keep<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.090> gonna<00:02:13.210> apply<00:02:13.540> a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
you want to keep it's gonna apply a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.630 
you want to keep it's gonna apply a
three<00:02:13.870> millimeter<00:02:14.050> thickness<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.040> face

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
three millimeter thickness to this face

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.880 
three millimeter thickness to this face
meaning<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.390> gonna<00:02:16.540> give<00:02:16.960> thickness<00:02:17.620> down

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
meaning it's gonna give thickness down

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.500 
meaning it's gonna give thickness down
it's<00:02:18.550> also<00:02:18.700> going<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.940> apply<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.180> three

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it's also going to apply a three

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.660 
it's also going to apply a three
millimeter<00:02:19.900> thickness<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:21.130> face<00:02:21.430> which

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
millimeter thickness to this face which

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.100 
millimeter thickness to this face which
is<00:02:21.700> gonna<00:02:21.910> put<00:02:22.330> three<00:02:22.600> millimeters<00:02:23.020> in

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
is gonna put three millimeters in

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.660 
is gonna put three millimeters in
thickness<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.680> direction<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.370> they're

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
thickness in that direction and they're

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.120 
thickness in that direction and they're
gonna<00:02:24.790> intersect<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:26.170> I'll<00:02:26.350> go<00:02:26.500> ahead<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.890> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
gonna intersect so I'll go ahead and and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.600 
gonna intersect so I'll go ahead and and
and<00:02:27.730> demonstrate<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.780> by<00:02:29.050> unhiding<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
and demonstrate that by unhiding the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.510 
and demonstrate that by unhiding the
modifier<00:02:31.540> here<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.130> sure<00:02:33.130> enough<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.370> can

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
modifier here and sure enough you can

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.420 
modifier here and sure enough you can
see<00:02:34.090> there's<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.080> little<00:02:35.260> bit<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.620> overlap

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
see there's a little bit of overlap

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.010 
see there's a little bit of overlap
there<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.180> there's<00:02:37.420> there's<00:02:37.780> areas

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
there so that there's there's areas

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.690 
there so that there's there's areas
where<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.560> Joan<00:02:38.800> she's<00:02:39.040> starting<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.370> bleed

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
where the Joan she's starting to bleed

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.360 
where the Joan she's starting to bleed
through<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> outside<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:41.890> we<00:02:41.980> don't<00:02:42.010> want

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
through to the outside and we don't want

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.920 
through to the outside and we don't want
that<00:02:42.490> okay<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.330> I'll<00:02:43.420> show<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.570> how<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.750> fix

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
that okay and I'll show you how to fix

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.550 
that okay and I'll show you how to fix
that<00:02:44.050> in<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> minute

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that in a minute

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.650 
that in a minute
to<00:02:45.040> further<00:02:45.250> demonstrate<00:02:45.490> we<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.300> take<00:02:46.480> this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
to further demonstrate we can take this

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.810 
to further demonstrate we can take this
thickness<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.380> actually<00:02:48.010> bump<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.400> up<00:02:48.550> higher

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
thickness and actually bump it up higher

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.550 
thickness and actually bump it up higher
and<00:02:49.180> as<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.450> go<00:02:49.570> higher<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.200> higher<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.440> higher

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
and as I go higher and higher and higher

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.770 
and as I go higher and higher and higher
you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.830> see<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.220> effect<00:02:51.640> okay<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.570> see

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
you can see that effect okay you can see

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.020 
you can see that effect okay you can see
what's<00:02:52.960> happening<00:02:53.350> there<00:02:53.500> go<00:02:54.400> back<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.790> forth

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
what's happening there go back and forth

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.730 
what's happening there go back and forth
okay<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:58.120> order<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.390> correct<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.110> we

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
okay so in order to correct that we

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.380 
okay so in order to correct that we
basically<00:03:00.070> need<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.520> an<00:03:00.670> editable<00:03:01.090> mesh

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
basically need to have an editable mesh

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.600 
basically need to have an editable mesh
on<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.020> inside<00:03:02.140> first<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.070> we<00:03:03.190> don't<00:03:03.370> have

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
on the inside first and we don't have

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.180 
on the inside first and we don't have
that<00:03:03.850> until<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.660> modifiers<00:03:05.260> apply<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:05.920> can

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
that until that modifiers apply we can

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.940 
that until that modifiers apply we can
only<00:03:06.400> edit<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.480> outside<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.410> we'll<00:03:08.650> live<00:03:08.830> with

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
only edit the outside so we'll live with

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.800 
only edit the outside so we'll live with
that<00:03:09.130> for<00:03:09.490> right<00:03:09.640> now<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.480> we'll<00:03:10.570> go<00:03:10.660> over

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
that for right now and we'll go over

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.340 
that for right now and we'll go over
here<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:10.960> set<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> couple<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.740> things<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:13.350> here

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
here and set a couple of things so here

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.990 
here and set a couple of things so here
you've<00:03:14.500> got<00:03:14.530> what's<00:03:14.950> called<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.640> offset

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
you've got what's called the offset

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.080 
you've got what's called the offset
clamp<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.110> just<00:03:17.320> do<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> point<00:03:17.830> five<00:03:18.040> I'll<00:03:18.970> be

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
clamp and I just do a point five I'll be

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.460 
clamp and I just do a point five I'll be
perfectly<00:03:19.330> honest<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.930> I'm<00:03:20.140> not<00:03:20.320> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
perfectly honest with you I'm not the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.830 
perfectly honest with you I'm not the
blender<00:03:20.830> guru<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.640> not<00:03:21.700> an<00:03:22.120> expert<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.570> this

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
blender guru I'm not an expert on this

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.199 
blender guru I'm not an expert on this
I've<00:03:23.650> played<00:03:24.220> with<00:03:24.340> these<00:03:24.550> settings<00:03:24.910> enough

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
I've played with these settings enough

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.350 
I've played with these settings enough
on<00:03:25.989> other<00:03:26.560> pieces<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.130> know<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.730> what<00:03:28.090> really

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
on other pieces to know what what really

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.540 
on other pieces to know what what really
works<00:03:28.570> out<00:03:28.780> well<00:03:29.020> for<00:03:29.050> me<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.890> didn't<00:03:30.250> just

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
works out well for me so I didn't just

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.990 
works out well for me so I didn't just
this<00:03:30.670> offset<00:03:31.060> clamp<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.480> 0.5<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:33.040> can<00:03:33.400> get<00:03:33.790> back

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
this offset clamp of 0.5 I can get back

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400 
this offset clamp of 0.5 I can get back
with<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.270> guys<00:03:34.390> later<00:03:34.600> if<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:34.959> specific

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
with you guys later if you have specific

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.560 
with you guys later if you have specific
questions<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.800> what<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.130> means<00:03:36.370> but<00:03:36.730> I'm

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
questions on what that means but I'm

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.910 
questions on what that means but I'm
sure<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:37.989> find<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.260> out<00:03:38.320> there<00:03:38.530> in<00:03:38.620> Google

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
sure you can find it out there in Google

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.190 
sure you can find it out there in Google
if<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.160> really<00:03:39.430> want<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.730> know<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.959> math

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
if you really want to know the the math

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.770 
if you really want to know the the math
behind<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:42.330> couple<00:03:43.330> other<00:03:43.420> things<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.750> want

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
behind it a couple other things I want

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.140 
behind it a couple other things I want
to<00:03:43.959> show<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.670> option<00:03:46.060> here

to show you here this this option here
for<00:03:46.180> high<00:03:46.390> quality<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.110> click<00:03:47.680> on<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.860> one

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
for high quality you click on that one

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.410 
for high quality you click on that one
there<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.640> what<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:48.880> does<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.239> calculates

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
there and what it does is it calculates

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.380 
there and what it does is it calculates
the<00:03:49.900> normals<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:51.580> know<00:03:51.700> that's<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.269> do

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
the normals you know that's that I do

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.090 
the normals you know that's that I do
that<00:03:52.690> one<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.410> way<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> normals<00:03:53.950> gonna

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
that one that way the normals gonna

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.500 
that one that way the normals gonna
calculate<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.580> for<00:03:54.700> all<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.970> faces<00:03:55.390> it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
calculate it for all the faces it

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.960 
calculate it for all the faces it
doesn't<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:55.870> change<00:03:55.989> much<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:57.430> helps

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
doesn't really change much it just helps

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.630 
doesn't really change much it just helps
me<00:03:58.000> sleep<00:03:58.959> well<00:03:59.200> at<00:03:59.320> night<00:03:59.380> knowing<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.890> my

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
me sleep well at night knowing that my

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.699 
me sleep well at night knowing that my
entire<00:04:00.910> models<00:04:01.300> got<00:04:01.390> normals<00:04:01.870> calculated<00:04:02.500> and

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
entire models got normals calculated and

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.310 
entire models got normals calculated and
I<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.340> go<00:04:03.459> through<00:04:03.670> there<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.209> do<00:04:05.140> whatever

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
I can go through there and do whatever

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.990 
I can go through there and do whatever
adjustments<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:05.890> need<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.100> make<00:04:06.310> ok<00:04:06.820> this

option<00:04:07.330> here<00:04:07.450> for<00:04:07.690> Phil<00:04:07.930> RIM<00:04:08.230> all<00:04:09.100> right<00:04:09.310> I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
option here for Phil RIM all right I

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.340 
option here for Phil RIM all right I
deselected<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.050> could<00:04:11.200> demonstrate

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
deselected it so I could demonstrate

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.530 
deselected it so I could demonstrate
exactly<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.459> does<00:04:12.610> all<00:04:13.000> right<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.330> here

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
exactly what it does all right so here

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.540 
exactly what it does all right so here
you<00:04:13.570> can<00:04:13.720> see<00:04:13.989> we<00:04:14.530> made<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.980> three<00:04:15.370> millimeter

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
you can see we made a three millimeter

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.610 
you can see we made a three millimeter
thickness<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.480> here's<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> outer<00:04:16.959> wall<00:04:17.290> and

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
thickness and here's the outer wall and

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.319 
thickness and here's the outer wall and
then<00:04:17.769> an<00:04:17.950> inner<00:04:18.130> wall<00:04:18.400> without<00:04:18.670> that<00:04:19.000> gap

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
then an inner wall without that gap

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.210 
then an inner wall without that gap
between<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.750> two<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:20.140> three<00:04:20.380> millimeters

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
between the two is three millimeters

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.370 
between the two is three millimeters
and<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.459> can<00:04:21.580> actually<00:04:21.760> see<00:04:22.060> here<00:04:22.350> where<00:04:23.350> that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
and you can actually see here where that

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.010 
and you can actually see here where that
geometry<00:04:23.890> is<00:04:24.250> bleeding<00:04:24.640> through<00:04:24.970> from<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
geometry is bleeding through from the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.470 
geometry is bleeding through from the
groove<00:04:26.320> on<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.650> side<00:04:26.950> of<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.280> helmet<00:04:27.610> okay

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
groove on the side of the helmet okay

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.000 
groove on the side of the helmet okay
that<00:04:28.930> geometry<00:04:29.170> is<00:04:29.410> coming<00:04:29.710> through<00:04:29.830> here

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
that geometry is coming through here

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.000 
that geometry is coming through here
we're<00:04:30.190> gonna<00:04:30.280> fix<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:30.730> in<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.060> little<00:04:31.270> while

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
we're gonna fix that in a little while

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.890 
we're gonna fix that in a little while
but<00:04:33.010> basically<00:04:33.340> what<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> fill<00:04:33.940> rim<00:04:34.300> modifier

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
but basically what the fill rim modifier

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.320 
but basically what the fill rim modifier
does<00:04:35.260> when<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.740> click<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.820> closes

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
does when you click that is it closes

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.360 
does when you click that is it closes
those<00:04:37.480> gaps<00:04:37.660> up<00:04:37.960> for<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.920> that<00:04:39.100> would<00:04:39.220> be

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
those gaps up for you so that would be

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.810 
those gaps up for you so that would be
this<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:39.940> rim<00:04:40.330> all<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.780> way<00:04:41.140> around<00:04:41.580> all<00:04:42.580> the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
this this rim all the way around all the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.130 
this this rim all the way around all the
way<00:04:42.850> around<00:04:43.180> where<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.390> applied<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.690> thickness

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
way around where you applied a thickness

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.040 
way around where you applied a thickness
and<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:45.640> basically<00:04:45.760> see<00:04:46.300> between<00:04:46.570> the

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
and you can basically see between the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.510 
and you can basically see between the
inner<00:04:47.260> shell<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.770> helmet<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.340> outer

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
inner shell of the helmet and the outer

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.760 
inner shell of the helmet and the outer
shell<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.120> helmet<00:04:49.210> okay<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:50.620> want

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
shell of the helmet okay and we want

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.800 
shell of the helmet okay and we want
that<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:51.070> be<00:04:51.100> filled<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:51.880> we<00:04:52.390> click<00:04:52.600> fill

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
that to be filled in so we click fill

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.330 
that to be filled in so we click fill
rim<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.170> it<00:04:53.230> takes<00:04:53.440> care<00:04:53.590> of<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:53.740> for<00:04:54.010> us<00:04:54.130> so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
rim and it takes care of that for us so

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.990 
rim and it takes care of that for us so
we're<00:04:55.060> good<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.240> go<00:04:55.300> now<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:56.880> thickness<00:04:57.880> is

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
we're good to go now the thickness is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.400 
we're good to go now the thickness is
where<00:04:58.150> we<00:04:58.240> want<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.540> be<00:04:58.720> thrilled<00:04:58.990> three

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
where we want to be thrilled three

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.840 
where we want to be thrilled three
millimeters<00:04:59.860> is<00:04:59.980> pretty<00:05:00.220> good<00:05:00.400> for<00:05:00.610> 3d

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
millimeters is pretty good for 3d

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.510 
millimeters is pretty good for 3d
printer<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:02.140> found<00:05:02.710> pretty<00:05:03.160> good<00:05:03.310> success

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
printer so I found pretty good success

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.220 
printer so I found pretty good success
is<00:05:03.880> my<00:05:04.000> face<00:05:04.210> played<00:05:04.510> in<00:05:04.630> lower<00:05:04.750> jaw<00:05:05.020> were

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
is my face played in lower jaw were

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.140 
is my face played in lower jaw were
printed<00:05:05.740> with<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.920> same<00:05:06.130> thickness<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:07.030> we'll

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
printed with the same thickness so we'll

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.400 
printed with the same thickness so we'll
go<00:05:07.240> ahead<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.480> do<00:05:07.540> that<00:05:07.690> for<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:07.990> upper<00:05:08.230> part

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
go ahead and do that for this upper part

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.920 
go ahead and do that for this upper part
of<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.590> helmet<00:05:08.890> as<00:05:09.010> well<00:05:09.480> like<00:05:10.480> I<00:05:10.600> said<00:05:10.660> before

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
of the helmet as well like I said before

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.870 
of the helmet as well like I said before
in<00:05:11.200> order<00:05:11.290> to<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.920> modify<00:05:12.310> any<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.670> mesh

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
in order to to modify any of the mesh

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.040 
in order to to modify any of the mesh
inside<00:05:13.240> here<00:05:13.390> we<00:05:13.480> need<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.720> apply<00:05:13.930> the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
inside here we need to apply the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.560 
inside here we need to apply the
modifier<00:05:14.440> so<00:05:15.340> once<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.000> do<00:05:16.150> that<00:05:16.180> though<00:05:16.540> you

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
modifier so once you do that though you

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.090 
modifier so once you do that though you
can't<00:05:16.900> go<00:05:17.020> back<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.380> adjust<00:05:17.470> these<00:05:17.860> things

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
can't go back and adjust these things

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.670 
can't go back and adjust these things
individually<00:05:18.450> unless<00:05:19.450> you<00:05:19.570> go<00:05:19.720> back<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:20.470> do

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
individually unless you go back and do

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.860 
individually unless you go back and do
the<00:05:20.800> undo<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.520> then<00:05:21.610> add<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.180> modifier<00:05:22.570> again

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
the undo and then add the modifier again

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.960 
the undo and then add the modifier again
so<00:05:23.140> once<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.160> get<00:05:24.280> these<00:05:24.460> settings<00:05:24.820> where<00:05:24.940> you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
so once you get these settings where you

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.860 
so once you get these settings where you
want<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.330> you<00:05:25.420> can<00:05:25.510> go<00:05:25.570> ahead<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.780> click

modifiers cannot be applied in edit mode

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.840 
modifiers cannot be applied in edit mode
okay<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.420> this<00:05:31.600> is<00:05:31.750> good<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.260> protects<00:05:32.650> you<00:05:32.850> you

go into object mode so you've got your

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.800 
go into object mode so you've got your
solid<00:05:37.240> here<00:05:37.660> you<00:05:37.780> hit<00:05:37.930> apply<00:05:38.820> okay<00:05:39.820> now<00:05:40.510> if<00:05:40.690> we

solid here you hit apply okay now if we

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.510 
solid here you hit apply okay now if we

back<00:05:46.360> in<00:05:46.480> edit<00:05:46.600> mode<00:05:46.720> now<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.050> can<00:05:47.200> see<00:05:47.320> we've

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
back in edit mode now you can see we've

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.250 
back in edit mode now you can see we've
got<00:05:47.530> an<00:05:47.650> editable<00:05:47.919> mesh<00:05:48.010> on<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.430> inside<00:05:48.520> and

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
got an editable mesh on the inside and

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.260 
got an editable mesh on the inside and
then<00:05:50.260> we<00:05:50.410> can<00:05:50.590> go<00:05:50.710> in<00:05:50.890> and<00:05:51.190> start<00:05:51.520> cleaning<00:05:51.910> up

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
then we can go in and start cleaning up

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.100 
then we can go in and start cleaning up
these<00:05:53.260> areas<00:05:53.800> here<00:05:54.580> where<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.570> geometry<00:05:55.750> is

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
these areas here where the geometry is

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.800 
these areas here where the geometry is
bled<00:05:56.380> through<00:05:56.680> okay<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.540> know<00:05:58.630> there's<00:05:58.780> a

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
bled through okay and you know there's a

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.150 
bled through okay and you know there's a
couple<00:05:58.930> ways<00:05:59.169> you<00:05:59.290> can<00:05:59.350> do<00:05:59.620> and<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.980> can<00:06:00.130> just

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
couple ways you can do and you can just

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.550 
couple ways you can do and you can just
grab<00:06:00.370> stuff<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:01.000> suck<00:06:01.810> it<00:06:01.960> back<00:06:02.110> down<00:06:02.290> inside

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
grab stuff and suck it back down inside

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.159 
grab stuff and suck it back down inside
the<00:06:03.100> inside<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.030> model<00:06:04.240> itself<00:06:04.630> so<00:06:04.840> you<00:06:04.930> can't

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
the inside the model itself so you can't

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.440 
the inside the model itself so you can't
see<00:06:05.500> it<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:06.220> then<00:06:06.490> once<00:06:06.669> you<00:06:06.790> go<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.060> export

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
see it and then once you go and export

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.950 
see it and then once you go and export
the<00:06:07.570> mesh<00:06:07.750> for<00:06:08.020> printing<00:06:08.500> your<00:06:09.900> software<00:06:10.900> is

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
the mesh for printing your software is

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.080 
the mesh for printing your software is
gonna<00:06:11.020> ignore<00:06:11.440> that<00:06:11.730> when<00:06:12.730> you<00:06:12.820> run<00:06:12.940> it

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
gonna ignore that when you run it

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.870 
gonna ignore that when you run it
through<00:06:13.120> netfabb<00:06:13.600> or<00:06:13.870> whatever<00:06:14.200> else<00:06:14.440> okay<00:06:15.370> so

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
through netfabb or whatever else okay so

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.100 
through netfabb or whatever else okay so
