have<00:02:18.629> not<00:02:18.900> tried<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.590> urban<00:02:19.920> decay<00:02:20.040> D<00:02:20.489> slick

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
have not tried the urban decay D slick

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.300 
have not tried the urban decay D slick
yet<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> can't<00:02:21.870> compare<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:22.410> one<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.129> this

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
yet so I can't compare that one to this

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.559 
yet so I can't compare that one to this
but<00:02:24.680> comparing<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:27.120> prefer

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
but comparing these two I really prefer

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.820 
but comparing these two I really prefer
the<00:02:27.599> NYX<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:29.280> because<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the NYX just because I think that it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.559 
the NYX just because I think that it
keeps<00:02:31.980> me<00:02:32.250> matte<00:02:32.519> for<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> longer<00:02:33.239> period<00:02:33.390> of

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
keeps me matte for a longer period of

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.990 
keeps me matte for a longer period of
time<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:34.110> had<00:02:34.950> really<00:02:35.310> high<00:02:35.459> hopes<00:02:35.489> for<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
time I had really high hopes for the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.750 
time I had really high hopes for the
urban<00:02:36.299> decay<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.190> used<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
urban decay one but it just I used it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.850 
urban decay one but it just I used it
for<00:02:38.790> my<00:02:38.940> sister's<00:02:39.360> wedding<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.989> pretty<00:02:40.739> much

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
everyone and it just kind of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.100 
everyone and it just kind of
disappointed<00:02:45.989> me<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.650> didn't<00:02:47.130> keep

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
as I thought that it would and so now

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.949 
as I thought that it would and so now

that I have the NYX I'm definitely
favoring<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.590> more<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.190> all<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.610> is<00:03:00.030> you

favoring this more and all I do is you

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.800 
favoring this more and all I do is you
just<00:03:00.810> hold<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.379> far<00:03:02.129> away<00:03:02.250> from<00:03:02.400> your<00:03:02.640> face<00:03:02.910> it

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
says x 12 inches and then I just do a

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.839 
says x 12 inches and then I just do a
circular<00:03:06.410> spray<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:08.010> hits<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.489> areas

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
circular spray so that it hits all areas

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.330

of<00:03:08.879> my<00:03:09.120> face<00:03:09.360> just<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.920> usually

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
of my face just like that so it usually

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.490 
of my face just like that so it usually
takes<00:03:14.579> up<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:15.239> think<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.019> got<00:03:16.200> something<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.410> my

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
takes up I think I got something in my

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.240 
takes up I think I got something in my
mouth<00:03:16.940> okay<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.660> usually<00:03:19.109> takes<00:03:19.410> four

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
mouth okay so it usually takes four

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.960 
mouth okay so it usually takes four
sprays<00:03:20.700> all<00:03:20.970> around<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:22.430> sometimes<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.819> can

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
sprays all around and sometimes you can

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.520 
sprays all around and sometimes you can
see<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.920> wet<00:03:26.130> my<00:03:26.280> face<00:03:26.519> pretty<00:03:26.910> well

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.349 
see that it wet my face pretty well
sometimes<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.650> would<00:03:28.799> take<00:03:28.829> extra<00:03:29.579> tissue<00:03:29.790> like

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359
