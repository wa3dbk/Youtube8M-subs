use the oils with AD a TD this is the
protocol<00:00:11.139> that<00:00:11.170> I<00:00:11.410> go<00:00:11.620> to<00:00:11.679> and<00:00:12.099> it<00:00:12.610> is

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
protocol that I go to and it is

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.869 
protocol that I go to and it is
cedarwood<00:00:13.210> vetiver<00:00:13.839> and<00:00:13.959> lavender<00:00:14.919> when

cedarwood vetiver and lavender when
people<00:00:16.510> ask<00:00:16.810> me<00:00:17.110> about<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.970> protocol<00:00:20.670> they

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
people ask me about this protocol they

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.490 
people ask me about this protocol they
ask<00:00:21.880> about<00:00:22.030> application<00:00:22.810> how<00:00:22.990> do<00:00:23.050> I<00:00:23.140> apply

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
ask about application how do I apply

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.830 
ask about application how do I apply
this<00:00:23.620> and<00:00:24.130> with<00:00:24.640> this<00:00:24.910> protocol<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.630> best

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
this and with this protocol the best

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.770

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
method is to layer it so when we talk

about applying and layering oils there

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.470 
about applying and layering oils there
are<00:00:32.760> different<00:00:33.760> places<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.240> can<00:00:34.450> put

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
are different places that you can put

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.610 
are different places that you can put
them<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:34.780> can<00:00:34.930> put<00:00:35.050> them<00:00:35.170> anywhere<00:00:35.260> on<00:00:35.590> your

going to start with the lavender and we
are<00:01:09.609> going<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.030> just<00:01:10.240> put<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.929> little<00:01:11.560> dot<00:01:12.009> on

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
are going to just put a little dot on

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.629 
are going to just put a little dot on
the<00:01:12.789> top<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.329> her<00:01:14.109> big<00:01:14.289> toe<00:01:14.560> we're<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.579> to

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:15.639 
the top of her big toe we're going to

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:18.449 
the top of her big toe we're going to
rub<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:15.999> in<00:01:16.179> for<00:01:16.780> about<00:01:16.990> 26<00:01:17.530> seconds<00:01:18.100> because

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:18.459 
rub it in for about 26 seconds because

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.899 
rub it in for about 26 seconds because
it<00:01:18.579> takes<00:01:18.789> 26<00:01:19.420> seconds<00:01:20.069> to<00:01:21.069> absorb<00:01:21.609> the<00:01:21.729> oil

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
it takes 26 seconds to absorb the oil

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.890 
it takes 26 seconds to absorb the oil
into<00:01:22.240> your<00:01:22.420> body<00:01:22.749> fully<00:01:23.219> so<00:01:24.219> after<00:01:24.670> 26<00:01:25.179> seconds

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
into your body fully so after 26 seconds

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.860 
into your body fully so after 26 seconds
take<00:01:26.110> our<00:01:26.260> second<00:01:26.740> foil<00:01:27.390> vetiver<00:01:28.390> which<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.840> a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
take our second foil vetiver which is a

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.590 
take our second foil vetiver which is a
very<00:01:29.110> thick<00:01:29.380> oil<00:01:29.620> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
very thick oil so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
very thick oil so
we'll<00:01:31.110> need<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:32.180> old<00:01:33.180> times<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.840> toe<00:01:34.080> to

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
we'll need a bit old times on the toe to

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.770 
we'll need a bit old times on the toe to
make<00:01:34.800> sure<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> gather<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.000> or

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
make sure that you gather on there or

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
make sure that you gather on there or
you<00:01:37.080> can<00:01:37.290> use<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.470> toothpick<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.460> out

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you can use a toothpick to get it out

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.300 
you can use a toothpick to get it out
too<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.270> put<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.260> there<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.160> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
too so put that on there and then you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
too so put that on there and then you
rub<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:44.119> after<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> 26<00:01:45.840> seconds

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
rub that in and after that 26 seconds

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.999 
rub that in and after that 26 seconds
you<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:47.010> your<00:01:47.300> third<00:01:48.300> oil<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you just get your third oil which you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
you just get your third oil which you
can<00:01:50.190> actually<00:01:50.340> use<00:01:50.580> the<00:01:50.970> roller<00:01:51.210> top<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.840> just

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
can actually use the roller top to just

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
can actually use the roller top to just
roll<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> top<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.690> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
roll it right on the top and then you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.180 
roll it right on the top and then you
wait<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.729> rub<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.910> in<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:58.500> another<00:01:58.710> 26

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
wait you rub that in and for another 26

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.730 
wait you rub that in and for another 26
seconds<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> should<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.210> good<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.479> go

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
seconds and you should be good to go

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.850 
seconds and you should be good to go
