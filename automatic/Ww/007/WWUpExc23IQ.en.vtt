bends and then feeding that input into
the<00:00:58.020> steering<00:00:58.320> wheel<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.010> i<00:00:59.100> were<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the steering wheel now if i were to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
the steering wheel now if i were to
totally<00:00:59.879> let<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.390> which<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> obviously

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
totally let go which is obviously

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
totally let go which is obviously
illegal<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.680> i<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.129> careful

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
illegal so i have to be very careful

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
illegal so i have to be very careful
here<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> system<00:01:03.690> does<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
here what the system does is it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
here what the system does is it
recognize<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.070> there's<00:01:05.309> no<00:01:05.670> steering<00:01:06.030> input

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
recognize that there's no steering input

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.320 
recognize that there's no steering input
from<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.750> whatsoever<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.740> after<00:01:08.729> 10<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> 15

ahead now interestingly enough I'm set

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.680 
ahead now interestingly enough I'm set
to<00:01:42.070> 68<00:01:42.490> miles<00:01:42.730> an<00:01:42.880> hour<00:01:43.030> but<00:01:43.210> you'll<00:01:43.360> see<00:01:43.540> from

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
to 68 miles an hour but you'll see from

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.150 
to 68 miles an hour but you'll see from
the<00:01:43.780> speedo<00:01:44.170> that<00:01:44.320> we're<00:01:44.410> actually<00:01:44.500> doing<00:01:44.710> 55

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
the speedo that we're actually doing 55

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.550 
the speedo that we're actually doing 55
because<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.180> says<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.630> order<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.170> stay<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.380> this

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
because it says in order to stay in this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.050 
because it says in order to stay in this
Lane<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:47.920> keep<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.160> safe<00:01:48.310> distance<00:01:48.370> from<00:01:48.820> that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
Lane we keep a safe distance from that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.670 
Lane we keep a safe distance from that
car<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.510> will<00:01:49.750> have<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:49.930> reduce<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.500> speed

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
car I will have to reduce the speed

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.219 
car I will have to reduce the speed
accordingly<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.450> what<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:52.690> means<00:01:52.930> over<00:01:53.200> a

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
accordingly so what this means over a

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.560 
accordingly so what this means over a
long<00:01:53.530> journey<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.520> effectively<00:01:55.000> means<00:01:55.240> that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
long journey it effectively means that

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.719 
long journey it effectively means that
you<00:01:55.780> you've<00:01:56.229> got<00:01:56.530> somebody<00:01:56.890> else<00:01:57.160> supporting

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
you you've got somebody else supporting

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.370 
you you've got somebody else supporting
you<00:01:57.850> which<00:01:58.270> means<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.690> you're<00:01:58.810> more<00:01:59.080> alert

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
you which means that you're more alert

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.770 
you which means that you're more alert
it's<00:01:59.620> less<00:01:59.950> tiring<00:02:00.340> over<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:00.850> long<00:02:01.000> drive<00:02:01.300> you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
it's less tiring over a long drive you

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.690 
it's less tiring over a long drive you
can<00:02:01.960> look<00:02:02.140> around<00:02:02.260> more<00:02:02.680> check<00:02:03.250> your<00:02:03.369> mirrors

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
can look around more check your mirrors

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.969 
can look around more check your mirrors
more<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.060> be<00:02:04.930> more<00:02:04.960> alert<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.470> drivers<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:05.950> the

more and be more alert to drivers on the

more and be more alert to drivers on the
road<00:02:06.250> now<00:02:06.790> also<00:02:06.970> if<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.300> want<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.600> overtake<00:02:08.080> and

road now also if I want to overtake and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
road now also if I want to overtake and
change<00:02:08.530> lanes<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.520> don't<00:02:10.290> indicate<00:02:11.310> what

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
change lanes but I don't indicate what

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.560 
change lanes but I don't indicate what
effectively<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.850> happen<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.270> i'll<00:02:13.360> show<00:02:13.390> you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
effectively I happen and i'll show you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.350 
effectively I happen and i'll show you
here<00:02:13.840> if<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.620> converge<00:02:15.370> lanes<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
here if I'm go to converge lanes the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.270 
here if I'm go to converge lanes the
system<00:02:16.810> beeps<00:02:17.110> at<00:02:17.320> me<00:02:17.350> tries<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.860> put<00:02:17.980> me<00:02:18.100> back

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
system beeps at me tries to put me back

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.610 
system beeps at me tries to put me back
into<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.700> lane<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.170> want<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.530> change

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
into the lane so if I do want to change

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.710 
into the lane so if I do want to change
lanes<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.190> have<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.640> indicate<00:02:21.910> which<00:02:22.240> makes<00:02:22.510> me

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
lanes I have to indicate which makes me

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.180 
lanes I have to indicate which makes me
a<00:02:22.750> better<00:02:22.959> driver<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.620> those<00:02:23.769> around<00:02:24.040> me

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
a better driver to those around me

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.650 
a better driver to those around me
because<00:02:24.550> they're<00:02:24.730> seeing<00:02:24.970> what<00:02:25.209> I'm<00:02:25.360> doing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
because they're seeing what I'm doing

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.870 
because they're seeing what I'm doing
and<00:02:26.110> when<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.380> indicate<00:02:26.739> what<00:02:27.340> happens<00:02:27.700> is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
and when I do indicate what happens is

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.330 
and when I do indicate what happens is
the<00:02:28.030> L<00:02:28.150> caste<00:02:28.480> system<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.959> lane<00:02:29.140> key<00:02:29.410> disables

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the L caste system the lane key disables

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.400 
the L caste system the lane key disables
itself<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.150> few<00:02:31.360> seconds<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.989> then

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
itself for a few seconds and then

hour the lane keep switches off you've
got<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.540> remember<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.019> lane<00:02:44.200> keep<00:02:44.560> needs<00:02:45.010> both

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
got to remember the lane keep needs both

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.280 
got to remember the lane keep needs both
of<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.700> lines<00:02:45.910> on<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> motorway<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:47.080> be<00:02:47.200> able

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
of the lines on the motorway to be able

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.870 
of the lines on the motorway to be able

to operate if it can't see either of
those<00:02:49.090> lanes<00:02:49.510> it'll<00:02:50.050> turn<00:02:50.200> off<00:02:50.380> anyway<00:02:50.769> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
those lanes it'll turn off anyway and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.430 
those lanes it'll turn off anyway and
also<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.880> benz<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.480> much<00:02:52.660> tighter<00:02:52.959> off<00:02:53.410> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
also the benz a much tighter off a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
also the benz a much tighter off a
motorway<00:02:53.890> which<00:02:54.580> means<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> talk<00:02:55.390> going

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
motorway which means that the talk going

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.970 
motorway which means that the talk going
through<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.170> steering<00:02:56.410> wheel<00:02:56.680> could

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
through to the steering wheel could

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.340 
through to the steering wheel could
potentially<00:02:57.640> overpower<00:02:58.420> someone<00:02:58.840> if<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.170> did

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
potentially overpower someone if it did

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.170 
potentially overpower someone if it did
go<00:02:59.530> around<00:02:59.739> those<00:02:59.890> bends<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.459> that's<00:03:00.970> never

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
go around those bends and that's never

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.640 
go around those bends and that's never
going<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.510> be<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.630> case<00:03:01.900> because<00:03:02.200> ultimately

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
going to be the case because ultimately

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.500 
going to be the case because ultimately
the<00:03:02.980> driver<00:03:03.250> always<00:03:03.550> has<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.060> be<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.239> control

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the driver always has to be in control

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.380 
the driver always has to be in control
of<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.840> car<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.980> system<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.580> intended

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
of the car so this system is intended

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.830 
of the car so this system is intended
primarily<00:03:07.810> for<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.380> motorway
