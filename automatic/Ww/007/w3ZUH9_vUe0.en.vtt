00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.700
 the 1 to 1 scale project can be downloaded 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 from the site to the engine free time item 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 vapor 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.129
 the motor is made of brass e 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.040
 branched glass for circuits 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.230
 printed the aluminum base itself is 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.629
 wanted to avoid the use of tone and for the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 flywheel closed a pulley of those 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.640
 that hold up one thing to spread the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 under the sun we start by cutting 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 the swing plate one shoulder 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.200
 of the support and the basement adel 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.090
 initially the holes are made with 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 a hand chuck and tip from a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 millimeter in diameter the crank 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.649
 comes from a lifetime and is welded onto a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.979
 small flywheel in solidarity vetronite 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.259
 to the crankshaft and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.930
 swashplate must be welded 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.300
 together in one time and once 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 make the piece check that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.710
 this fits perfectly to the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.950
 shoulder, if necessary , repeat with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.570
 very thin sandpaper the connecting rod yes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.420
 consists of a brass tube of the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.209
 external diameter of 2 mm internal of a 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.259
 millimeter in steel rod comes to you 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.060
 threaded into the reinforcement welded i 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.679
 bronze spacers and practice the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.679
 pouring forum that crosses the 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.380
 cylinder swing plate from a 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.630
 rod of 6 mm diameter are obtained 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
 the piston and the closing cap of the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.880
 cylinder the portion of the beauty that is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 inserts on the crank you create from a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.739
 brass sheet with a thickness of 3 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.989
 tenths of a millimeter that will come later 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.959
 welded following the very detailed 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.380
 indications on the site of which it is 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.239
 made here a summary summary evaluated 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.760
 the maximum point is the action towards 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.980
 left then insert a pin 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.130
 curved in the cylinder racking is 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.530
 marked this position performed a yes 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.569
 the action in the other sense that you mark 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.690
 high point of maximum field action 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.090
 these are the exact locations where 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.170
 drill the entry lights holes 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.280
 steam exiting the shoulder 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.560
 made correctly 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.600
 two transfer holes we build the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.810
 inlet and outlet manifold 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.840
 steam is then welded to the cap of 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.560
 cylinder closure thank you for 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.560
 kind attention
