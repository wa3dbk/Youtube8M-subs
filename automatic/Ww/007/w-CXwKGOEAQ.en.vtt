personal thing okay kind of doing it on
the<00:00:43.890> edge<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.519> little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:44.909> in<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.330> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the edge but a little bit in from the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.130 
the edge but a little bit in from the
edge<00:00:45.799> now<00:00:46.799> it<00:00:47.159> might<00:00:47.369> be<00:00:47.430> too<00:00:48.180> much<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.839> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
edge now it might be too much at this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
edge now it might be too much at this
point<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.830> actually<00:00:50.400> outline<00:00:50.820> these<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.360> the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.890 
finish some of these lines a little bit
and<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.590> could<00:01:43.830> write<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.870> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
fine line pen at a later time which I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
fine line pen at a later time which I
think<00:01:49.229> I'm<00:01:49.320> probably<00:01:49.530> gonna<00:01:49.800> end<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.580> so

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.430 
yeah let's give this one down here
a<00:02:28.040> treatment<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:30.170> catching<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:33.230> makes<00:02:34.230> no

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
a treatment of catching it makes no

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
a treatment of catching it makes no
sense<00:02:34.740> whatsoever<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.680> lot<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.710> times<00:02:38.040> okay

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
sense whatsoever but a lot of times okay

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.960 
sense whatsoever but a lot of times okay
this<00:02:38.880> time<00:02:38.910> I'm<00:02:39.450> going<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.990> do<00:02:40.560> something

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
this time I'm going to do something

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:56.850 
this time I'm going to do something
brighter<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.720> so

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.470 

doing<00:02:57.550> swirls<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.720> can't<00:02:59.050> really<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.620> him

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
doing swirls you can't really see him

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.040 
doing swirls you can't really see him
but<00:03:01.480> that's<00:03:01.690> okay<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:03.270> don't<00:03:04.270> really<00:03:04.480> want<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
but that's okay I don't really want to

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.400 
but that's okay I don't really want to
see<00:03:05.230> him<00:03:05.320> like<00:03:05.890> all<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.370> much

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.370 

I'm<00:03:13.950> not<00:03:14.190> digging<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.820> really<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.890> could

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
I'm not digging that really so I could

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.320 
I'm not digging that really so I could
maybe<00:03:19.380> take<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:20.070> pale<00:03:20.520> olive<00:03:21.120> color<00:03:21.660> here

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
maybe take this pale olive color here

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.970 
maybe take this pale olive color here
and<00:03:24.330> just<00:03:24.630> go<00:03:24.810> over<00:03:24.960> it<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:25.740> of<00:03:25.770> get<00:03:25.920> rid

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and just go over it and kind of get rid

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.660 
and just go over it and kind of get rid
of<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:28.610> there<00:03:29.610> we<00:03:29.700> go

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.980 

I<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:34.050> poster<00:03:34.650> paint<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.610> my<00:03:36.180> tip<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:36.959> I

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
I have that poster paint on my tip but I

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.980 
I have that poster paint on my tip but I
definitely<00:03:37.500> don't<00:03:37.650> want<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.660> stay

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
definitely don't want to have that stay

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.830 
definitely don't want to have that stay
on<00:03:40.170> there<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:41.550> I'm<00:03:41.640> just<00:03:41.819> getting<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.240> off<00:03:42.390> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
think that it's better it's not it's not

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.240 
think that it's better it's not it's not
on<00:03:49.080> there<00:03:49.550> I'm<00:03:50.550> totally<00:03:50.940> having<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.250> feeling

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
on there I'm totally having the feeling

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.430 
on there I'm totally having the feeling
of<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.700> extending<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.510> square<00:03:54.900> down<00:03:55.170> here

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.479 
of like extending this square down here
oh<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:56.760> forgot<00:03:57.270> that<00:03:57.709> pin<00:03:58.709> doesn't<00:03:59.010> work<00:03:59.280> on

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
oh I forgot that pin doesn't work on

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.330 
oh I forgot that pin doesn't work on
this<00:03:59.700> background<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.739> like<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:05.010> had

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
this background so like I just had

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.310 
this background so like I just had
though<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:06.239> had<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.570> weird<00:04:06.750> thought<00:04:07.020> so

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
though I just had that weird thought so

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.410 
though I just had that weird thought so
I<00:04:07.350> thought<00:04:07.680> I'm<00:04:08.400> gonna<00:04:08.580> go<00:04:08.760> with<00:04:08.970> it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
I thought I'm gonna go with it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.920 
I thought I'm gonna go with it
this<00:04:10.230> could<00:04:10.440> stay<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.340> way<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.970> but

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.599 

it<00:04:15.930> was<00:04:16.109> just<00:04:16.320> one<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.590> those<00:04:16.739> random<00:04:17.280> thoughts

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
it was just one of those random thoughts

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.800 
it was just one of those random thoughts
and<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.650> already<00:04:20.040> like<00:04:20.910> I'd<00:04:21.239> probably<00:04:21.540> do

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
and so already like I'd probably do

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.470 
and so already like I'd probably do
somewhere<00:04:22.109> down<00:04:22.290> here<00:04:22.910> especially<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.300> this

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
somewhere down here especially on this

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
pen just even a simple line around here

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:05.100 
pen just even a simple line around here
it<00:05:58.360> will<00:05:58.569> take<00:05:59.560> this<00:06:03.419> start<00:06:04.419> pulling<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.930> in

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110
