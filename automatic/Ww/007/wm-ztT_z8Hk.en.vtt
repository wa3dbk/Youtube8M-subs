 I want to buy them I recommend them 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.660
 because the price is not as expensive as the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.110
 professional professionals there are but 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.720

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.470
 to this camera is very good for the video 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.810
 but audio is also very important 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.860
 and maybe do a live streaming from 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.780
