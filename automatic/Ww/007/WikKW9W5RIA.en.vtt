00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.550 

the<00:00:22.950> first<00:00:23.190> thing<00:00:23.370> we<00:00:23.520> do<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.450> identify<00:00:24.660> values

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the first thing we do to identify values

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.010 
the first thing we do to identify values
is<00:00:25.860> to<00:00:26.550> try<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.360> scene<00:00:27.540> in<00:00:27.690> front<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
is to try to see the scene in front of

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.280 
is to try to see the scene in front of
us<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.320> black<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> white<00:00:29.360> to<00:00:30.360> do<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
us in black and white to do this the

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.710 
us in black and white to do this the
best<00:00:31.470> thing<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.010> to<00:00:32.130> try<00:00:32.310> to<00:00:32.369> squint<00:00:32.940> or

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
best thing to do is to try to squint or

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.540 
best thing to do is to try to squint or
take<00:00:34.260> off<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.560> glasses<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:35.100> you're<00:00:35.250> wearing

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
take off your glasses if you're wearing

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.820 
take off your glasses if you're wearing
them<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:36.809> try<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> scene

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
them you try to look at the scene

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.670 
them you try to look at the scene
through<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.520> eyelashes<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.900> almost<00:00:40.260> close

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
through your eyelashes so almost close

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
through your eyelashes so almost close
your<00:00:40.950> eyes<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> open<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.879> slightly<00:00:42.330> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
your eyes and open them slightly and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
your eyes and open them slightly and
look<00:00:43.440> through<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.830> scene<00:00:44.129> through<00:00:45.090> your

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
look through the scene through your

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.510 
look through the scene through your
eyelashes<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> take

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
eyelashes what this will do is to take

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
eyelashes what this will do is to take
out<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.330> color<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> scene

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
out all of the color out of the scene

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.460 
out all of the color out of the scene
and<00:00:49.760> simplify<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.570> smaller<00:00:51.930> number<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
and simplify it into a smaller number of

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.009 
and simplify it into a smaller number of
shapes<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.720> little

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
shapes so that what you see is a little

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.259 
shapes so that what you see is a little
bit<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.500> this

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
bit more like this

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.470 
bit more like this
now<00:00:57.269> that's<00:00:57.480> greatly<00:00:57.839> reduced<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.830> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
now that's greatly reduced as the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.579 
now that's greatly reduced as the
complexity<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.659> shapes<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.110> front<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.470> you

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
complexity of the shapes in front of you

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.250 
complexity of the shapes in front of you
and<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.640> got<00:01:02.850> rid<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.089> a<00:01:03.390> lot<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.050> color

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and also got rid of a lot of the color

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.890 
and also got rid of a lot of the color
so<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.800> see<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.640> different<00:01:06.180> shades<00:01:06.630> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so all you see is different shades of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.090 
so all you see is different shades of
gray

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.740 

now<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.850> make<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.450> sketch<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.190> major

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
now we make a sketch of all the major

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:27.120 
now we make a sketch of all the major
our<00:01:17.810> view<00:01:17.960> shapes<00:01:18.290> in<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.590> painting

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.460 

the<00:01:27.280> idea<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:30.150> keep<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.210> drawing<00:01:31.630> very

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
the idea is to keep the drawing very

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.640 
the idea is to keep the drawing very
simple<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.930> keep<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.380> number<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.740> shapes<00:01:36.040> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
simple and keep the number of shapes to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.330 
simple and keep the number of shapes to
basically<00:01:38.880> no<00:01:39.880> more<00:01:40.119> than<00:01:40.330> about<00:01:40.600> seven<00:01:41.340> seven

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
basically no more than about seven seven

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.789 
basically no more than about seven seven
or<00:01:42.460> eight<00:01:42.580> shapes<00:01:43.420> certainly<00:01:44.409> no<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:44.740> than

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
or eight shapes certainly no more than

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:53.639 
or eight shapes certainly no more than
about<00:01:45.070> ten<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.810> worry<00:01:53.020> too<00:01:53.259> much<00:01:53.289> about

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
about ten and don't worry too much about

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.460 
about ten and don't worry too much about
the<00:01:53.799> drawing<00:01:54.039> because<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.659> drawing<00:01:56.049> at<00:01:56.320> this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
the drawing because the drawing at this

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.380 
the drawing because the drawing at this
point<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.979> not<00:01:57.399> important<00:01:57.909> all<00:01:58.060> we're<00:01:58.210> trying

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
point is not important all we're trying

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:10.430 
point is not important all we're trying
to<00:01:58.479> do<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:59.140> map<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.069> values

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.620 

and<00:02:10.800> again<00:02:11.340> remember<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.970> squint<00:02:12.360> while

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and again remember to squint while

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:22.210 
and again remember to squint while
you're<00:02:12.840> doing<00:02:13.050> this

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.360 

and<00:02:23.410> remember<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.680> want<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.920> ignore<00:02:25.310> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
and remember you want to ignore the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.430 
and remember you want to ignore the
small<00:02:25.610> shapes<00:02:26.060> by<00:02:26.330> squinting<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.960> make<00:02:27.260> them

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
small shapes by squinting to make them

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.310 
small shapes by squinting to make them
blend<00:02:27.680> into<00:02:27.950> larger<00:02:28.400> shapes<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:30.170> will

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
blend into larger shapes and this will

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.720 
blend into larger shapes and this will
also<00:02:30.440> help<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:30.830> reduce<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.430> number<00:02:31.460> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
also help you reduce the number of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.860 
also help you reduce the number of
shapes<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.240> drawing<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.570> we<00:02:35.690> have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
shapes in the drawing so here we have

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
shapes in the drawing so here we have
most<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.410> major<00:02:37.370> value<00:02:37.910> shapes<00:02:38.240> just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
most of the major value shapes just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.230 
most of the major value shapes just
about<00:02:39.890> sketched<00:02:40.490> out<00:02:41.200> we've<00:02:42.200> got<00:02:42.380> one<00:02:43.240> light

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
about sketched out we've got one light

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.330 
about sketched out we've got one light
shape<00:02:45.220> here<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.430> well<00:02:47.650> okay<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:48.710> now<00:02:48.980> we've<00:02:49.190> got

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
shape here as well okay so now we've got

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.230 
shape here as well okay so now we've got
the<00:02:49.490> major<00:02:49.670> shapes<00:02:50.680> land<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.000> drawing

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
the major shapes land out in the drawing

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.590 
the major shapes land out in the drawing
in<00:02:53.450> terms<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.870> major<00:02:54.080> values
