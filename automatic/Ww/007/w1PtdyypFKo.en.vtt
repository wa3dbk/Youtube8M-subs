is right before the season 2 patch came

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.519 
is right before the season 2 patch came
out<00:00:28.380> where<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.609> updates<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.230> xbox

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
out where the updates are for the xbox

out where the updates are for the xbox
one<00:00:31.710> edition<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.309> conquest<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> as

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
one edition and conquest is not in it as

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.330 
one edition and conquest is not in it as
David<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.380> doubt<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.160> put

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
David I doubt they really want to put

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
David I doubt they really want to put
the<00:00:35.430> old<00:00:35.579> map<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.719> point<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the old map in at this point in there in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.260 
the old map in at this point in there in
the<00:00:38.129> game's<00:00:38.460> development<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.059> would<00:00:39.149> be

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the game's development that would be

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.209 
the game's development that would be
kind<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.629> odd<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.920> counterproductive

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
kind of odd and a bit counterproductive

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
kind of odd and a bit counterproductive
so<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.960> why<00:00:43.110> conquest<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:44.010> likely

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so that is why conquest is most likely

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.250 
so that is why conquest is most likely
not<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> game<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.660> things<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
not in the game so the things with it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.340 
not in the game so the things with it
are<00:00:49.469> definitely<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.750> difficulty

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
are definitely the more difficulty

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
are definitely the more difficulty
playing<00:00:52.620> certain<00:00:52.920> God's<00:00:53.309> less<00:00:54.120> double<00:00:54.390> kiltie

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
playing certain God's less double kiltie

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.439 
playing certain God's less double kiltie
playing<00:00:54.960> certain<00:00:55.289> gods<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.010> more<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
playing certain gods and more about just

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.650 
playing certain gods and more about just
getting<00:00:57.629> used<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.440> thing<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> third

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
getting used to kind of thing the third

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.970 
getting used to kind of thing the third
first<00:01:00.899> thing<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.109> gonna<00:01:01.199> start<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.710> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
first thing I'm gonna start out with is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
first thing I'm gonna start out with is
the<00:01:02.460> UI<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.149> i<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.660> great<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the UI the you i think is great for a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.590 
the UI the you i think is great for a
console<00:01:04.739> edition<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> game<00:01:05.519> works<00:01:06.390> out

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
console edition of this game works out

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.440 
console edition of this game works out
very<00:01:06.630> well<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.760> what<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> tebe

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
very well with the what the way a tebe

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.289 
very well with the what the way a tebe
looks<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.490> puts<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> focus<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
looks it really puts the focus on the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
looks it really puts the focus on the
places<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> need<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.900> looking<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.409> without

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
places you need to be looking at without

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
places you need to be looking at without
making<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.729> too<00:01:14.909> far<00:01:15.119> away<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> see

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
making them too far away for you to see

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
making them too far away for you to see
it<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.229> think<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> very<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:17.729> great

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it so I think it was a very very great

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.539 
it so I think it was a very very great
setup<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:19.020> console<00:01:19.799> edition<00:01:20.100> great<00:01:20.250> job<00:01:20.400> by

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
setup for a console edition great job by

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.870 
setup for a console edition great job by
them<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.570> controller<00:01:21.900> layouts<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> most

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
them the controller layouts for the most

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
them the controller layouts for the most
part<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.210> decent<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:25.560> im<00:01:25.680> using<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.070> think

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
part are decent when im using I think

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.219 
part are decent when im using I think
it's<00:01:26.369> disappeared<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.270> superior<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's disappeared the superior one I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
it's disappeared the superior one I
think<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> best<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> bit

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
think it's the best it is a bit

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
think it's the best it is a bit
difficult<00:01:30.750> getting<00:01:31.110> used<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
difficult getting used to with the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.510 
difficult getting used to with the
ultimate<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.180> leveled<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.520> use

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
ultimate I have leveled up and use

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.770 
ultimate I have leveled up and use
abilities<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> meant<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.720> my

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
abilities when I meant to use my

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
abilities when I meant to use my
ultimate<00:01:37.049> many<00:01:37.200> times<00:01:37.439> because<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.130> use<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
ultimate many times because they use a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660 
ultimate many times because they use a
combination<00:01:39.259> system<00:01:40.259> where<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.310> lb

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
combination system where you use your lb

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
combination system where you use your lb
and<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:41.880> RB<00:01:42.210> which<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.990> two<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> your

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and your RB which are two of your

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.649 
and your RB which are two of your
abilities<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.009> use<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.090> together<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.570> order

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
abilities and use them together in order

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.499 
abilities and use them together in order
to<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> ultimate<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> other<00:01:47.970> layouts

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
to use the ultimate the other layouts

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.410 
to use the ultimate the other layouts
for<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> most<00:01:49.079> part<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:51.149> more

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
for the most part are a bit more

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.370 
for the most part are a bit more
difficult<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:52.049> use<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.180> by<00:01:54.509> how<00:01:54.990> hard

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
difficult to use but I'm not by how hard

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
difficult to use but I'm not by how hard
it<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> use<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.920> abilities<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:57.119> how

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it is to use your abilities just how

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.410 
it is to use your abilities just how
hard<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.570> aiming<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:59.180> you<00:02:00.180> can't

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
hard it is aiming them as you can't

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.819 
hard it is aiming them as you can't
really<00:02:00.509> aim<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.049> you're<00:02:01.229> right<00:02:01.619> joystick

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
really aim if you're right joystick

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260

the face buttons which are your skills

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.289 
the face buttons which are your skills
on<00:02:04.710> those<00:02:04.860> layouts<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:05.909> why<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.090> think

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
on those layouts so that's why I think

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.700 
on those layouts so that's why I think
it's<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> best<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:06.960> which<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.560> works

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
it's the best one which I think works

of<00:04:41.530> course<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:41.949> we'll<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.160> see<00:04:42.370> how<00:04:42.430> that

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
of course so we'll just see how that
