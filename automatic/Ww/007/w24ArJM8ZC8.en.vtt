00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.240
 I will not make the noise 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.560
 both my camera and I will liquefy those that 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.230
 I am back 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.340
 good girls I already have what here 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.700
 Ecuador 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.500
 and here I have what it is for bread very 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.830
 important girls for whom I was wrong 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.510
 This is the chocolate taught them to 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.280
 vanilla I made the vanilla but the 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.990
 rule with cocoa and so I stay chocolate 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.300
 well in this pan I put my sugar 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.370
 because this Teflon pan and I'm going to 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.870
 put on low heat and I'll make my 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.909
 candy to put it on the base 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.180
 well what are we going to do here with the 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.709
 refractory and with this butter in 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.709
 spray we're going to bathe 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 well really I have my candy already 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.920
 ready and I'll add it there 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.570
 I already have it here and I'm going to add it 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.660
 very careful girl because she will be less 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:29.870
 very hot and we can stay 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.280
 and we see it like that 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.280
 until it dries 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.820
 alone and if it does not look good on the camera 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.050
 because he can not find another better 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.099
 angle to record them 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.099
 but so 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:54.280
 so it has to be 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:59.040
 I hope it cools to add more 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.040
 the things that carry 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.710
 Y 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.860
 good since it's cold I'm going to add 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.270
 what 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.270
 what beat the bread 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.700
 and with the help of a spatula 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.110
 I'm going to finish what I get with a lot 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.110
 watch out 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.289
 and all this very carefully 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:47.900
 good since we get the east like this is going to 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:51.200
 I do not know if you can see it there 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:56.860
 I'm closer to the camera 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:01.280
 what it will do if we add it little by little 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:06.430
 I will add what the judge 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.430
 little by little as you want when 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:16.700
 when it starts to bake all this 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.700
 it comes off alone 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.510
 but we add it 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.010
 girls if they want to flan add the 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.680
 vanilla me because it really happened to me 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:40.780
 no longer do not buy this I ended but so 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.790
 so it's going to stay, I'm going to do it in a bathroom 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.390
 Maria right now I will teach you how to 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.980
 arrange it on a fret so that because 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.780
 as they have the candy I can not 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.940
 put directly because it would burn 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.450
 then it would have to be in the water bath 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:59.950
 so now I teach you how good 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:02.380
 so I cover my mold and put a 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.840
 tray with water because I'm going to make it 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.420
 bain marie as I told you I'm going to 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.210
 put for an hour at 350 degrees 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.930
 I'm going to cover here also to make it 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.570
 cooking easier and get out fast 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.850
 well then that's the way I 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.850
 I'll wait and see how we get
