00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.710
 the indices 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 3 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.820

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.689
 in which 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.929
 no we no longer look at the netherlands 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.179
 and why 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.209
 they were not thinking of it 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.920
 we were just gone 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.169

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.289
 then 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
