the deep sink in the mobile spots there
are<00:03:43.329> some<00:03:43.660> very<00:03:43.930> important<00:03:44.620> system<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.829> first

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
are some very important system the first

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.770 
are some very important system the first
thing<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.700> fluence<00:03:49.030> feels<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.420> lot<00:03:49.720> more

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
thing is the fluence feels a lot more

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.870 
thing is the fluence feels a lot more
fun<00:03:50.320> there's<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.010> lot<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.340> sound<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.790> wind

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
fun there's a lot of sound and wind

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.319 
fun there's a lot of sound and wind
making<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.480> world<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:53.049> existence<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:54.190> the

making of world of existence and the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.180 
making of world of existence and the
second<00:03:55.329> thing<00:03:55.510> is<00:03:55.690> there's<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.290> bigger<00:03:56.620> turbo

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
second thing is there's a bigger turbo

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.370 
second thing is there's a bigger turbo
which<00:03:57.670> means<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.090> fluence<00:03:58.570> comes<00:03:58.810> with<00:03:59.019> Alvin

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
which means the fluence comes with Alvin

having<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.209> bigger<00:04:19.510> turbo<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.380> get

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
having a bigger turbo is that you get

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.029 
having a bigger turbo is that you get
more<00:04:20.709> turbo<00:04:21.100> lag<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.729> under<00:04:22.320> $2,200<00:04:23.320> M<00:04:23.560> you

more turbo lag so under $2,200 M you

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.250
