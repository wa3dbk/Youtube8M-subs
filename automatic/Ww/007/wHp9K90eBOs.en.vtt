fingers and slowly pull this loop up

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.850 
fingers and slowly pull this loop up
your<00:01:23.740> line<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.930> what<00:01:26.080> you<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.380> do<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.650> start

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
pulling the tag end and it's going to go

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.860 
pulling the tag end and it's going to go
ahead<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.729> get<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.030> line<00:01:31.180> closer<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> eye

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
ahead and get the line closer to the eye

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.219 
ahead and get the line closer to the eye
of<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.200> hook<00:01:33.360> still<00:01:34.360> we're<00:01:34.690> not<00:01:34.720> going<00:01:35.140> to

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
of the hook still we're not going to

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.480 
of the hook still we're not going to
cinch<00:01:35.500> down<00:01:35.560> yet<00:01:35.920> we're<00:01:36.070> going<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.250> do<00:01:36.400> this

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
cinch down yet we're going to do this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.000 
cinch down yet we're going to do this
one<00:01:36.760> more<00:01:36.940> time<00:01:39.090> pull<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.360> up<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.799> line<00:01:41.979> a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
one more time pull this up the line a

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.060 
one more time pull this up the line a
little<00:01:42.220> ways<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.700> slowly<00:01:43.680> pull<00:01:44.680> your<00:01:44.710> tag

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
little ways and slowly pull your tag

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.060 
little ways and slowly pull your tag
what<00:01:45.970> this<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.270> doing<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.840> getting<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
what this is doing this is getting the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.130 
what this is doing this is getting the
whole<00:01:48.280> knot<00:01:48.549> closer<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.750> eye<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.110> that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
whole knot closer to the eye so that

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.990 
whole knot closer to the eye so that
when<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.530> do<00:01:50.740> cinch<00:01:51.010> down<00:01:51.250> we're<00:01:51.549> going<00:01:51.729> to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
when we do cinch down we're going to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.390 
when we do cinch down we're going to
eliminate<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:53.409> know<00:01:53.530> two<00:01:53.590> or<00:01:53.770> three<00:01:53.920> inches

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
eliminate you know two or three inches

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.609 
eliminate you know two or three inches
of<00:01:54.549> line<00:01:54.790> burn<00:01:55.119> that's<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:55.990> creates<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.439> weak

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
of line burn that's what creates a weak

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.500 
of line burn that's what creates a weak
point<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:56.979> that's<00:01:57.189> why<00:01:57.400> if<00:01:57.700> you're<00:01:58.210> breaking

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
point and that's why if you're breaking

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.870 
point and that's why if you're breaking
off<00:01:58.869> with<00:01:59.110> fluorocarbon<00:01:59.590> line<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.640> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
off with fluorocarbon line this is the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.399 
off with fluorocarbon line this is the
reason<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.780> how<00:02:01.900> you're<00:02:02.080> going<00:02:02.290> to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
reason this is how you're going to

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.120 
reason this is how you're going to
eliminate<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:04.210> go<00:02:04.360> ahead<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.950> do<00:02:06.040> it

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
eliminate that so go ahead you can do it

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.119 
eliminate that so go ahead you can do it
