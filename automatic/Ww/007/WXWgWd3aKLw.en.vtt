00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.809
 for all guys and welcome back to those 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.830
 two on the server we finally talk to you about 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.300
 a very competitive competitive game 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 exact competitive it is a game 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.410
 which is not normal is a game 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.109
 absolutely crazy 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.269
 we are talking about plain sight in which 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 we are called to impersonate gods 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.329
 cute ninja robots that succeed to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.040
 to absorb energy to grow and to 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.320
 blow yourself up 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 there are suicidal ninjas right there 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.540
 we will read in the description on steam 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.930
 ninja on the cc however the game itself is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.840
 very interesting because it is very fast 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.149
 and besides stimulating a due nausea 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 at the speed of the game and also 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.949
 fun because you have to take everyone 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 how many your enemies and speed 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.480
 no light is accurate 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.280
 there are no weapons despite these 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 robots go around wielding one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 mechanical katana don't even use the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.360
 hut the way to destroy them is a lot 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.659
 simple once in the vicinity of a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 enemy must block them operation that 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.930
 will happen automatically after that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 you must hold the button down 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.880
 left mouse to load the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 your attack more time than that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.860
 hold this button down longer 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 destructive ok rivers and you will say but 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.810
 I already had the good news in it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 effects if we start with everything first 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 by saying that it is a game that makes the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 gravity a sneer 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.009
 yes indeed you can say wander around 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.009
 for the absolutely 3d map is 360 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.870
 degrees ie you can jump into each 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.270
 map point exactly co 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.160
 the partially occurring type casted yes yes 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.520
 Exactly do you realize that your map 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.010
 is actually a small planet with a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.870
 with a gravitational core in the center 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.900
 so that you can attach yourself to 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.420
 any surface of the map the thing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.610
 interesting is that when you go to give 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.860
 look at the modes and number 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.110
 of the maps one remains truly without 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.750
 breath yes indeed there are so many 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.290
 modes and lots of maps all very much 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 pretty 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:25.630
 there is not a bad is not a game see 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.260
 there are beautiful textures and beautiful that they do 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.490
 I know the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.040
 there is no complexity of design 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.500
 none of these are textures 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.960
 they are practically absent in the world that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.640
 where you will go to play though the game there 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.650
 takes so much that you don't me 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.120
 cares a cabbage 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 nevertheless not imagine a 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.990
 graphic of the case are putting in 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.420
 pleasant game to watch is not that 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.580
 be ugly but we want to say there are 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.830
 very few robot models are all 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.170
 equal no particle effects 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.930
 of the notes however is a very game 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 engaging and very fun that one 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.600
 which we want to talk about is also the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.489
 very low price of this title 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.310
 because if you are thinking that maybe it's a 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.070
 free to play or maybe I paid 20 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.650
 euro you are wrong no it is well 2010 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.080
 it is not that one can afford to 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.209
 ask for too much even if there are 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.340
 titles and despite being very old 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.860
 let alone , however, they do this 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.440
 title you find it on g2 to type a euro e 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.410
 something I on steam for 5 euros 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.570
 it is not an absolutely spent one 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.300
 funny how we played in 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.250
 lan with friends very very tasty 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.959
 also because you have the possibility of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.260
 create your match then 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.730
 choosing various modifiers e 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.140
 customizing the clash we have the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.380
 death match we capture the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.480
 flag we have so many 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.190
 beautiful modes including some that 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.440
 we had never seen in anyone else 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.560
 game although in reality a mode 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.410
 reminiscent of art mode and you have worked in 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.590
 head the head of a dinosaur yes 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.740
 you are kind of dinosaur tv and you have to 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.290
 destroy others but let's say that 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.060
 are modalities seen with some 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.570
 additional peculiarity that makes them 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.520
 unique 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.200
 let's say what made us love 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.770
 immediately this game because if you 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.540
 the boxes of the usual tps are broken 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.880
 fps deleted the rat scene fee 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.370
 this game could offer you some 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.290
 hours of fun out of the ordinary yes 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.670
 attention to the sense of vomiting that is not 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.010
 due to the beauty of the game 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.320
 I want to emphasize the pro why 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.510
 at the beginning, nothing is understood 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.510
 you actually risk vomiting
