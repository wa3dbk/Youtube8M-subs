so I'm doing it is switching these gears
on<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.379> output<00:00:07.830> shaft<00:00:09.740> because<00:00:12.860> this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
on to this output shaft because this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.279 
on to this output shaft because this
pinion<00:00:14.509> is<00:00:15.509> chipped<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.830> not

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
pinion is chipped and that one is not

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.910 
pinion is chipped and that one is not
this<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.680> mind<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.359> syncro<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
this was out of mind the syncro and the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.779 
this was out of mind the syncro and the
forth<00:00:22.920> gears<00:00:24.439> just<00:00:25.439> broken<00:00:25.830> happened

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
forth gears just broken happened

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
forth gears just broken happened
I<00:00:28.160> got<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> transmission<00:00:29.699> from<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.990> guy<00:00:31.199> for

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
I got a transmission from this guy for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
I got a transmission from this guy for
$200<00:00:32.870> like<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.880> but<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> fine<00:00:38.480> all

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
$200 like this but it is fine all

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.010 
$200 like this but it is fine all
besides<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> case<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.600> screwed<00:00:42.930> up

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
besides that and the case is screwed up

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
besides that and the case is screwed up
but<00:00:43.200> I'm<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.649> case<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:45.989> already

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
but I'm gonna use my case so I already

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.010 
but I'm gonna use my case so I already
unlocked<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> bolt<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.600> I'm<00:00:51.600> gonna<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
unlocked the bolt and I'm gonna have to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.920 
unlocked the bolt and I'm gonna have to
unlock<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.680> next<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.629> want<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> show<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
unlock that one next I want to show you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
unlock that one next I want to show you
that<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:58.070> slides<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.629> fully<00:01:00.629> intact<00:01:05.060> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that it just slides out fully intact the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730 
that it just slides out fully intact the
hard<00:01:06.240> part<00:01:06.510> about<00:01:06.600> doing<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.409> getting

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
hard part about doing this was getting

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
hard part about doing this was getting
the<00:01:08.270> clamps<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:10.020> hold<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.060> output<00:01:12.060> shaft

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the clamps and to hold the output shaft

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.539 
the clamps and to hold the output shaft
in<00:01:12.479> place<00:01:12.830> because<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> would<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.189> roll

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in place because it would just roll

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
in place because it would just roll
around<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:16.530> much

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
around and you know it was pretty much

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.480 
around and you know it was pretty much
impossible<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:18.479> tools<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> actual

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
impossible the tools for it the actual

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.289 
impossible the tools for it the actual
tools<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.119> hold<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.570> opinion<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.170> place<00:01:22.439> were

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
tools to hold the opinion in place were

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
tools to hold the opinion in place were
super<00:01:24.299> expensive<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:26.340> just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
super expensive and you know I'm just

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.310 
super expensive and you know I'm just
not<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.030> couldn't<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> spend<00:01:28.320> $200<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> tool

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
not I couldn't I spend $200 on the tool

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.039 
not I couldn't I spend $200 on the tool
so<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.380> used<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> vise<00:01:32.430> grip<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.270> clamp<00:01:33.600> for

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so I used the vise grip and a clamp for

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.460 
so I used the vise grip and a clamp for
wood<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:36.560> jerry-rigged<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.090 

and<00:01:41.010> before<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> take<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.120> bolt<00:01:43.050> off<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and before you can take the bolt off you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.480 
and before you can take the bolt off you
have<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.810> knock<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.320> indentations<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
have to knock out the indentations on

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.140 
have to knock out the indentations on
the<00:01:47.520> bolt

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
the bolt

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.690 
the bolt
I<00:01:49.070> used<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.280> flathead<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:51.950> Hammer<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.370> hit

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
I used a flathead and Hammer just hit

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.170 
I used a flathead and Hammer just hit
them<00:01:53.760> out<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:55.110> them<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:56.060> even<00:01:57.060> as

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
them out and got them as even as

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.750 
them out and got them as even as
possible<00:01:57.920> without<00:01:58.920> hitting<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> shaft

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
possible without hitting the shaft

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.880 
possible without hitting the shaft
because<00:02:00.270> again<00:02:00.860> chip<00:02:02.780> then<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.990> took<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
because again chip then when I took the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.730 
because again chip then when I took the
gears<00:02:05.160> off<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.850> made<00:02:06.270> sure<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.540> keep<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
gears off I made sure to keep all the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.150 
gears off I made sure to keep all the
washers<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.429> bearings<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.030> place

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
washers and the bearings in place

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.990 
washers and the bearings in place
because<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.530> mix<00:02:13.890> those<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.700> put<00:02:14.880> them

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
because if you mix those up and put them

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.760 
because if you mix those up and put them
in<00:02:15.090> backwards<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.810> something<00:02:16.200> stupid<00:02:16.560> like

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
in backwards or something stupid like

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.510 
in backwards or something stupid like
that<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.430> probably<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> lot<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.930> problems

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.310 

so<00:02:23.520> what<00:02:23.610> I've<00:02:23.670> done<00:02:23.880> here<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.510> got<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:24.930> clamps

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
so what I've done here I got my clamps

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.120 
so what I've done here I got my clamps
and<00:02:25.440> all<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:26.270> put<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> bolt<00:02:27.600> back<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:28.459> to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
and all that put the bolt back on to

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.530 
and all that put the bolt back on to
exactly<00:02:32.130> where<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> was<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.209> tell<00:02:33.360> by<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
exactly where it was you can tell by the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.740 
exactly where it was you can tell by the
little<00:02:33.840> rivets<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.830> know<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:36.420> where<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
little rivets and you know to where the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750 
little rivets and you know to where the
shaft<00:02:36.990> really<00:02:37.560> sticks<00:02:37.830> out<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.040> torque<00:02:38.580> did

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
shaft really sticks out a torque did

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.330 
shaft really sticks out a torque did
that<00:02:40.310> started<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.459> 75<00:02:42.650> foot<00:02:43.650> pounds<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.250> then

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that started at 75 foot pounds and then

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.180 
that started at 75 foot pounds and then
went<00:02:44.550> up<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> 80<00:02:45.590> because<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:46.920> right<00:02:47.100> in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
went up to 80 because that's right in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.280 
went up to 80 because that's right in
the<00:02:47.250> middle<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.500> spec<00:02:49.500> range<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:52.080> I'm<00:02:52.140> just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the middle the spec range so I'm just

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.240 
the middle the spec range so I'm just
gonna<00:02:52.380> leave<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.620> at<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.010> it's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
gonna leave it at that because it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.290 
gonna leave it at that because it's
right<00:02:53.459> where<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.850> was<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.730> should<00:02:56.940> be<00:02:57.060> good

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
right where it was and it should be good

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.350 
right where it was and it should be good
everything<00:02:58.019> seems<00:02:58.260> fine
