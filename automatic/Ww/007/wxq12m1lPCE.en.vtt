00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.180
My name is Pepa, and youre watching GALtv!

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:20.170
Hi Girls, for all of those who don't know
who I am, my name is Pepa and im one of the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.170
new members of the chanel!

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.160
On our facebook page we posted a question
asking what you guys wanted to see in the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160
next video.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.619
Alot of people wanted to see a short haired
gyaru hair tutorial!

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.180
Im bringign you a look thta is a bit complicated
but with a bit of patience and some practice

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.890
it will come out great!

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.260
This hairstyle is called Sujimori, which means
striped hair.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.610
The idea is to create all these hair stripes
and stack them ontop of eacother to create

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.610
volume.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.370
Hope you enjoy and lets start the tutorial!!

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.680
Before we started I already straightened my
hair.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.140
I find that straight hair helps with separating
the strands later on so its super important.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.210
We have to separate the fringe and the body
of the hair from where we will be making the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.210
twisties.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.600
The fringe goes diagonally and the line where
your twisties will start should be around

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.290
the middle of the eyebrow.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:23.700
You have to separate the hair with clips and
pins so you can work on each piece of the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670
hairstyle individually.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:38.049
Since we are starting with the twisties first
I move the fringe and the body of the hair

00:01:38.049 --> 00:02:01.799
out of my way.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:21.240
Split the hair in two roughly through the
middle.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:57.580
Now tugging towards the back of the head,
twist horizontally.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.180
Secure with a pin and repeat for the second
twistie!

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.030
Now apply hairspray and move the fringe away
from the main hair.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.910
Now that that is out of the way, the boring
part starts.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.100
You need to tease and hairspray each section
until you get almost to the top.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.819
Remember this style is all about volume so
dont let the hair clump up and stick together,

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.819
separate it.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.459
Tease, spray, separate and lower the next
section.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.680
Tease, spray,separate.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:44.150
A trick that helps is teasing the hair and
laying it on the opposite side.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:53.750
So you can pull out the strands later and
your hair is ready and nicely teased.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.260
Now you separate the strands, place them and
repeat.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.810
Honestly there is no true secret to this,
just repeat the steps:

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.620
Separate, curl the ends, place.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.350
Spray it so it dosn't budge and repeat!

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.350
Separate, curl, place and hairspray!

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.330
You have to repeat this thousands of times.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:34.229
The idea is to keep on tacking the thin strands
on top of eachother to create that volume.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:50.010
The more strands and the thinner they are,
the bigger the hair and the better the sujimori.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:05:05.080
When you get to the front be careful and pay
attention to the shapeit has, this is the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.050
first thing everyone will see when looking
at it.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.750
When you get to the end remember to round
out the shape to prevent looking like a helmet

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.520
head or an alien.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.870
Put strands towards the back, one side and
the other, giving it shape.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.320
Please dont forget to style the back!!!

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.310
Separating, curling and spraying til the last
strand,.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.550
Organize the strands, curl te bangs and spray!

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.720
This is the final result.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.229
I know it wasnt an easy look, but patience
and practice will allow anyone to do it.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.229
