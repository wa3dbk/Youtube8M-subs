00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 ah 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.710
 I present the new guaraní pro glove 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.140
 g2 ltd guaraní the new line of reus 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.610
 as we can see a big double cloud 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.170
 It goes through the whole area of ​​the back that 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.450
 will allow to have different points of 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.850
 flexion and above all it serves to give you the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.770
 name the new line thanks to the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.570
 warrior tribe called guaraní that 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.820
 inhabited the areas of the Amazons that 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.489
 The World Cup went through Brazil 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.800
 Brazil this summer and Guarani represents 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.420
 perfectly the warrior style that 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.420
 Hereu and to equip his new glove 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.760
 as you know aside from a model looks 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.770
 where hereu is fully loaded 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.870
 technology on the back there is also a 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.910
 glove the pro g 2 which is the most used 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.010
 usually by professionals who 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.200
 we are analyzing and stands out for everything 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.460
 otherwise it is a very technical glove 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.229
 but extremely simple is to say 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.300
 use the necessary technology to 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.979
 that endurance is as comfortable as 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.950
 we find two pieces of latex 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.990
 natural separated by the big w of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.119
 guaraní that will generate the points of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.470
 bending you do not have oxilia that pretends 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.090
 be a light glove not a glove 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.890
 excessively armed and if we 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.840
 we found with the fabric projects that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.580
 will allow all points to be generated 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
 of possible bending so that endurance is 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.380
 very technical with the textile air bell that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.300
 we can see in the zones in the zones of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.580
 January 2 or what he is going to do is 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.890
 that the inner area of ​​the glove is 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.380
 hot when it's cold in winter 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.869
 outside and be cool when in summer 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.520
 make a lot of heat outside the area of 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.020
 thumb we see we also have a 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.509
 latex area we see that it also has the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 Elastic fabric pro flex therefore we 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.990
 let's find with a very glove 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.950
 light very technical and that fits 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 perfectly to our brand 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.679
 then we go to the palm as 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.100
 all models of top range of reus in 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.860
 the compound that mounts is the g 2 g 2 is 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 the latex of maximum adhesion of reus and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.340
 It is a latex grip stays 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.320
 Extreme like all range models 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.630
 high but it stands out especially because in 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.780
 Wet meets almost almost like the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.760
 specific plants for water is 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.400
 mounted a flat cut the cut more 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.959
 classic as extra technologies then we 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.750
 we find these areas that we see in 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.190
 the fingertips in blue 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.170
 simulate fingerprints but it's a 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.600
 resource that reus uses to give us 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.090
 some areas with an extra grip and also 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.560
 that they absorb the erosion that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.930
 can produce when the glove contacts 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.459
 against the ball or against the ground 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.440
 second important zone the finish 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.670
 angular of the fingertips we see 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.220
 that instead of ending in a rounded 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.660
 as they usually end up at an angle with 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.060
 this we get to make the glove more 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.070
 comfortable and especially that the latex area 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.800
 be as uniform and as big 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.270
 possible when we know the blockages and 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.620
 to finish as a curiosity because we 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.930
 we found that the pinkie area 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.090
 on the inside has an extra 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.420
 latex and not the characteristic textile air 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.819
 bend 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.170
 in the rest of fingers this is because it is 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.239
 because making a lock usually the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.860
 little finger is the one that sticks out and the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.599
 ball many times contact 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.709
 this area and we need that too 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.709
 have flu 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.300
 we went on to talk about the doll and the 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.890
 closing on this occasion red yes pulling 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.540
 totally of classicism and only 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.549
 introduces two technologies that are going to 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.349
 help put on and take off the glove 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.180
 especially when we already have a glove 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.129
 in our hand the first of these 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900
 helps is this shooter who has the area 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.090
 of the closure and will do that when 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.519
 We want to open the glove having a 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.860
 finger busy with another glove opening 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.239
 be as simple as possible and in the area 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.650
 internally we find the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.750
 traditional pool this is already a system 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.819
 that comes from years ago that makes 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.140
 we can grab the wristband here and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.590
 put on the glove without any 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.180
 difficulty 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.650
 once with the glove on we 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.349
 we found with a doll of the ticas 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.060
 of the most classic system and a single strip 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.709
 Velcro closure that will make 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.129
 the glove fits perfectly to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.129
 our hand
