and Sharmon is about to show us the
interlocking<00:00:14.539> technique<00:00:15.160> it's<00:00:16.160> a<00:00:16.369> new

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
interlocking technique it's a new

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.220 
interlocking technique it's a new
technique<00:00:16.940> that<00:00:16.970> apparently<00:00:17.690> arm<00:00:17.990> is

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
technique that apparently arm is

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.640 
technique that apparently arm is
patented<00:00:19.270> but<00:00:20.270> lets<00:00:20.419> people<00:00:20.570> show<00:00:20.929> me<00:00:21.109> that<00:00:21.320> I

patented but lets people show me that I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.790 
patented but lets people show me that I
tell<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.429> detail<00:00:22.789> is<00:00:22.910> all<00:00:23.029> about

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
tell you the detail is all about

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.359 
tell you the detail is all about
interlocking<00:00:24.800> technique<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:27.650> interlocking

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
interlocking technique the interlocking

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.319 
interlocking technique the interlocking
technique<00:00:28.820> is<00:00:28.999> give<00:00:29.210> you<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.359> flat<00:00:30.999> circle<00:00:31.999> on

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
technique is give you a flat circle on

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.950 
technique is give you a flat circle on
the<00:00:32.509> hair<00:00:33.670> so<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:34.730> don't<00:00:35.090> have<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.840> don't

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the hair so you don't have the you don't

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.270 
the hair so you don't have the you don't
have<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.260> feel<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.500> bump<00:00:37.240> and<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:39.710> thickness<00:00:39.980> of

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
have to feel a bump and the thickness of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.910 
have to feel a bump and the thickness of
the<00:00:40.460> hair<00:00:40.900> because<00:00:41.900> you<00:00:42.050> actually<00:00:42.230> lock<00:00:42.740> in

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
the hair because you actually lock in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.370 
the hair because you actually lock in
the<00:00:43.070> hair<00:00:43.340> in<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:43.970> you<00:00:44.540> actually<00:00:44.960> hidden<00:00:45.200> the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
the hair in and you actually hidden the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.640 
the hair in and you actually hidden the
hair<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.930> person<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:48.350> have<00:00:48.440> long<00:00:48.620> hair

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
hair in so the person I have long hair

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.590 
hair in so the person I have long hair
then<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:49.490> don't<00:00:49.670> have<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:49.820> worry<00:00:50.150> because<00:00:50.330> all

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
then you don't have to worry because all

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.770 
then you don't have to worry because all
you<00:00:50.780> do<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.020> interlock<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.940> find<00:00:53.240> areas

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
you do is interlock it you find areas

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.720 
you do is interlock it you find areas
where<00:00:54.850> there's<00:00:55.850> no<00:00:56.150> here<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.280> leave<00:00:58.490> you

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
where there's no here and you leave you

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.820 
where there's no here and you leave you
put<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.090> there<00:00:59.330> so<00:00:59.780> that<00:00:59.990> there's<00:01:00.290> nothing

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
put it there so that there's nothing

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.600 
put it there so that there's nothing
showing<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.110> can<00:01:03.470> put<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:03.890> your<00:01:03.920> space

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
showing and you can put it in your space

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.580 
showing and you can put it in your space
actually<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.049> don't<00:01:06.229> have<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.439> worry

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
actually so you don't have to worry

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.279 
actually so you don't have to worry
about<00:01:06.710> your<00:01:06.979> client<00:01:07.430> worrying<00:01:07.960> what<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.109> can

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
about your client worrying what you can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.859 
about your client worrying what you can
do<00:01:09.469> with<00:01:09.679> the<00:01:09.799> hair<00:01:10.009> itself<00:01:13.509> so<00:01:14.509> as<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.719> can

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
do with the hair itself so as you can

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.419 
do with the hair itself so as you can
see<00:01:14.929> it's<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.439> flat<00:01:15.710> surface<00:01:17.049> it's<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.140> flat<00:01:18.409> look

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.249 

you<00:01:22.429> keep<00:01:22.640> doing<00:01:22.999> that<00:01:23.119> in<00:01:23.390> any<00:01:23.630> area<00:01:24.049> any

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
you keep doing that in any area any

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.929 
you keep doing that in any area any
direction<00:01:24.679> you<00:01:24.920> want<00:01:25.249> as<00:01:25.490> long<00:01:25.579> as<00:01:25.700> you're

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
direction you want as long as you're

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.899 
direction you want as long as you're
comfortable<00:01:26.179> with<00:01:26.689> it

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
comfortable with it

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.770 
comfortable with it
it<00:01:28.909> doesn't<00:01:29.509> hurt<00:01:30.100> does<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.219> hurt

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
it doesn't hurt does it hurt

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.380 
it doesn't hurt does it hurt
it<00:01:32.780> doesn't<00:01:33.140> hurt<00:01:34.000> then<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.119> get<00:01:35.270> everything

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
it doesn't hurt then you get everything

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:46.719 
it doesn't hurt then you get everything
in<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:36.409> nice<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.829> flat<00:01:45.429> I've<00:01:46.429> created

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
in and it's nice and flat I've created

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.550 
in and it's nice and flat I've created
this<00:01:47.000> technique<00:01:47.450> only<00:01:47.599> because<00:01:47.990> my<00:01:48.020> client

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
this technique only because my client

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.649 
this technique only because my client
had<00:01:48.679> a<00:01:48.709> lot<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.039> hair<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.579> I<00:01:50.209> didn't<00:01:50.539> know

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
had a lot of hair and I didn't know

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.279 
had a lot of hair and I didn't know
where<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:50.929> put<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.439> hair<00:01:51.969> so<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:53.479> just<00:01:53.989> came<00:01:54.259> up

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
where to put the hair so I just came up

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:03.249 
where to put the hair so I just came up
with<00:01:54.469> this<00:01:54.829> idea<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:02.000> it's<00:02:02.119> basically<00:02:02.599> looping

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
with this idea so it's basically looping

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.469 
with this idea so it's basically looping
into<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.280> hair<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.670> keep<00:02:07.939> looping<00:02:08.179> until

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
into the hair so you keep looping until

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.190 
into the hair so you keep looping until
you're<00:02:08.780> finish<00:02:09.170> whichever<00:02:09.679> way<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.369> can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
you're finish whichever way you can

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.949 
you're finish whichever way you can
until<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.349> hair<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.910> entire<00:02:14.209> length<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.870> in

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.290 

so<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.829> can<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.579> flat

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.390 

and<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.260> ready<00:02:27.530> for<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.980> Hollywood
