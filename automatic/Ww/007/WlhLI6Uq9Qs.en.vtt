00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
generate more spin on the ball and we'll

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
generate more spin on the ball and we'll
give<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.790> extra<00:01:41.970> pump<00:01:42.680> second

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
give you a little extra pump second

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.109 
give you a little extra pump second
