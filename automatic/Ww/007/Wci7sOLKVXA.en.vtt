 also the possibility of policy power and 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.439
 the opposition together find a way out of this 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.710
 situation break 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.009
 issue of a bill of exchange 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.389
 but it seems in stability in 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:19.599
 Ukraine is interested 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.319

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:34.779
 law enforcement 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.579
 but in alcoholism the media look at the fact that 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.499
 happens in at least a better future for 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:40.949
