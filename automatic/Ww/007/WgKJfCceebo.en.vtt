00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
pack is very expensive

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
pack is very expensive
so<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.120> will<00:02:15.240> show<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.200 
so you go to this and it will show you
where<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.760> by<00:02:17.880> using<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
where it is you can get it by using the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.450 
where it is you can get it by using the
media<00:02:18.450> fire<00:02:18.690> or<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.500> mirror<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.830> think<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.250> had

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
media fire or the mirror I think I had

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460 
media fire or the mirror I think I had
chosen<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> mirror<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.690> says<00:02:21.990> here<00:02:22.350> it

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
chosen the mirror and it says here it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.810 
chosen the mirror and it says here it
has<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.920> eight<00:02:23.100> hours<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
has like eight hours because it's a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.700 
has like eight hours because it's a
really<00:02:24.210> large<00:02:24.390> file<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:25.050> cancel<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.440> again

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
really large file they cancel it again

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.480 
really large file they cancel it again
because<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.490> already<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:28.460> basically<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
because I already have that basically I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.400 
because I already have that basically I
have<00:02:29.940> all<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.360> these<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.840> black<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.260> white
