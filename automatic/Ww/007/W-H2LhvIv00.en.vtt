00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
is gonna be for the blueprint known as

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.530 
is gonna be for the blueprint known as
surprise<00:00:38.410> em<00:00:38.860> f's<00:00:39.130> now<00:00:39.399> this<00:00:40.030> blueprint<00:00:40.360> will

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
surprise em f's now this blueprint will

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.360 
surprise em f's now this blueprint will
be<00:00:40.630> on<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.870> far<00:00:41.230> east<00:00:41.530> side<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.980> map<00:00:42.190> you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
be on the far east side of the map you

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.729 
be on the far east side of the map you
have<00:00:42.399> to<00:00:42.670> go<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.090> Brooklyn<00:00:43.480> Bridge<00:00:43.750> I<00:00:44.380> did

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
have to go to the Brooklyn Bridge I did

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.960 
have to go to the Brooklyn Bridge I did
a<00:00:44.770> video<00:00:45.040> on<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:46.180> medkit<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.930> goldmine

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
a video on the medkit the goldmine

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.210 
a video on the medkit the goldmine
earlier<00:00:48.970> this<00:00:49.570> week<00:00:49.810> and<00:00:50.110> what<00:00:50.890> you<00:00:50.980> have<00:00:51.100> to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
earlier this week and what you have to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.370 
earlier this week and what you have to
do<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.580> climb<00:00:52.210> up<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.510> bridge<00:00:52.750> support<00:00:53.230> now

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
do is climb up this bridge support now

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.080 
do is climb up this bridge support now
so<00:00:53.620> it's<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:53.950> long<00:00:54.100> ways<00:00:54.310> up<00:00:54.490> and<00:00:54.970> you're

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
so it's a long ways up and you're

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.540 
so it's a long ways up and you're
probably<00:00:55.270> gonna<00:00:55.510> die<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:56.080> couple<00:00:56.350> times<00:00:56.740> but

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
probably gonna die a couple times but

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.370 
probably gonna die a couple times but
you<00:00:57.790> have<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.060> put<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.510> dot<00:00:58.810> in<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.110> middle

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
you have to put your dot in the middle

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.590 
you have to put your dot in the middle
of<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.590> beam<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.100> just<00:01:00.340> walk<00:01:00.550> up<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.060> it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
of the beam and just walk up and it's

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.210 
of the beam and just walk up and it's
fairly<00:01:01.840> easy<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.320> do<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:02.950> can<00:01:02.980> be

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
fairly easy to do but it can be

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.840 
fairly easy to do but it can be
aggravating

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
aggravating
