00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.700
 By this Punyopunyo 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.450
 Do you know something 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.750
 For example, when riding a bike 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.279
 With Oakley sunglasses, wind is more involved compared to ordinary flat sunglasses 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.490
 Will be reduced 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:24.470
 For example , the wind entrapment is better than ordinary sunglasses by fitting to such a feeling face 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.289
 Will be reduced 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 However 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.050
 The part that makes this sunglasses even more powerful is the part before that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.900
 I really want to wear 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:44.290
 Well then from now on this Spirit Jacket 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.290
 I would like to put on a gasket upgrade kit . 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 First of all 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.590
 This is a helper- 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.490
 This is also very easy to put on the side of here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.960
 It is this third only 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.000
 this 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.100
 At the root of this stay section 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.380
 I will catch 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.380
 In this way, the hook 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.020
 I can say this side 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.090
 After the flowers teeth 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.950
 Wet inside 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.649
 It is completed in fe 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:39.220
 After that I think if you can put in accordance with the Well It is this strap This is taste 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.960
 Because the hole is open 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.960
 Just plug in here 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.280
 Reverse side anymore 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.010
 I can say 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 This is completed 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.310
 I tried to put it on 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.310
 How is it 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.479
 With sunglasses 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.980
 Between your face 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.849
 There is a degree of adhesion to the face by entering this earp 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.860
 When used on a motorcycle etc. by doing this 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.470
 Further more performance than ever 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 It is a sunglasses part that I will demonstrate 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.790
 So today we introduced the Casquette Upgrade Kit
