engineering spectacle but it's also

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.460 
engineering spectacle but it's also
about<00:01:45.460> trying<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.210> create<00:01:46.660> a<00:01:46.869> super<00:01:47.200> community

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
between we kind of come up with like a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.550 
between we kind of come up with like a
task<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.330> would<00:01:49.540> make<00:01:49.690> sense<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.080> do<00:01:50.229> weekly

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560

and we realize that we used to taking
family<00:01:52.119> photos<00:01:52.270> every<00:01:53.020> week<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.590> just

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619
