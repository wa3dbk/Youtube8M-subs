00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.910
 in that phase of penalty has been decisive 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.190
 and also 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.980
 we are also very fortunate to 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.620
 have the best goalkeeper in the world in that 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.500
 facet and perhaps regarding the penalty 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.870
 Well yes moments that mark the 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.260
 difference moments that maybe for me 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.449
 well I had thought I wanted you not to 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.859
 I'm going to lie but I know it's true 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.050
 that until the end a one does not decide 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.929
 until you do not see how as a current goalkeeper 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.689
 and maybe after my last experience 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.090
 in in champions with with real madrid 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.000
 Well many comments were said 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.590
 that maybe the footballer in my case 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.360
 I was not prepared to assume this 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 kind of responsibility from iu to one like 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.480
 footballer always touches the pride and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.340
 Today, I wanted to return to 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.949
 that responsibility because emotionally 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.809
 I was confident but good what 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.600
 important the history of the team and the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.000
 go to the end of the criticisms of the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.370
 mistakes one is when the more real 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.859
 he really learns but yes it is true 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.780
 that coming from our coach that 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.369
 he knows us perfectly 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.799
 more or less you can make an idea of 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.670
 I was able to do something like that because 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.560
 it has been trying for many years and knows 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.299
 that deep down I'm a little crazy that 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.860
 will remember the whole world is that 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.810
 Spain continues to make history that 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.509
 what we have achieved has not 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.330
 got nobody and now we have the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.149
 icing from finishing the job with back 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.670
 to win the final on Sunday and hopefully 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.320
 so be it because I believe that despite 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.680
 all the years that we have 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.170
 working after all for the people 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.300
 does not value the effort that Spain makes 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.539
 difficult to get to where we have 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.159
 come and it would be a shame not to win that 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.220
 final but it can also happen because 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.350
 it's football and Spain will not win 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.390
 always but let's hope that this Sunday 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.979
 if it is said like that, it has not lent much 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 attention to what happened are not moments 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.860
 of a lot of tension of a lot of nervousness and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.830
 practically the only thing that one is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.080
 pending the penalties of your 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.030
 colleagues that go to the bottom of the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.250
 network and above all of what 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.990
 of what and what is right that the truth 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.860
 no one is a chance that we 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.860
 it fails because it is unique
