00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
something you would do in public but if

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.220

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you have to and you do it then you know

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.430 
you have to and you do it then you know
it<00:00:55.590> becomes<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> proposition<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.440> of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it becomes really a proposition of of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.479 
it becomes really a proposition of of
disposal<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.670> would<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.350> guess<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> could

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
disposal I would think I guess you could

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
disposal I would think I guess you could
say<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> same<00:01:02.789> thing<00:01:03.030> too<00:01:03.570> about

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
say the same thing too about

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190 
say the same thing too about
I<00:01:04.500> mean<00:01:05.400> smoking<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.330> people<00:01:06.750> still<00:01:06.990> smoke

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
I mean smoking right people still smoke

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.149 
I mean smoking right people still smoke
but<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> cigarette

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
but what do you do with the cigarette

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
but what do you do with the cigarette
butts<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> point<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.210> wouldn't<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> much

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
butts the point is I wouldn't so much

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.440 
butts the point is I wouldn't so much
condemn<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> behavior<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> trimming<00:01:12.360> your

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
condemn the behavior of trimming your

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
condemn the behavior of trimming your
nails<00:01:12.689> assuming<00:01:13.260> you're<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.380> biting<00:01:13.680> them

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
nails assuming you're not biting them

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.140 
nails assuming you're not biting them
and<00:01:14.040> spitting<00:01:14.340> them<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.700> trimming

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and spitting them but actually trimming

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
and spitting them but actually trimming
them<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.570> wouldn't<00:01:16.350> confuse<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.979> behavior

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
them I wouldn't confuse that behavior

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.170 
them I wouldn't confuse that behavior
visa<00:01:18.390> vie<00:01:18.630> crosnes<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.670> choice<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
visa vie crosnes with the choice you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
visa vie crosnes with the choice you
make<00:01:21.360> visa<00:01:21.750> vie<00:01:22.020> disposing<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.670> guess<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
make visa vie disposing so my guess is

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
make visa vie disposing so my guess is
if<00:01:24.299> you're<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> person<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.080> throws

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
if you're the kind of person that throws

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.749 
if you're the kind of person that throws
the<00:01:25.470> cigarette<00:01:25.799> butt<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> ground<00:01:26.369> or
