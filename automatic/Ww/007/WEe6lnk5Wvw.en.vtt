gonna be a problem you need to deal with
it<00:00:21.700> either<00:00:22.390> remove<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.020> vegetation<00:00:23.200> if<00:00:23.980> you

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
it either remove the vegetation if you

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.800 
it either remove the vegetation if you
hadn't<00:00:24.400> watered<00:00:24.669> up<00:00:24.759> your<00:00:24.939> field<00:00:25.270> yet<00:00:25.419> you<00:00:25.660> can

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
hadn't watered up your field yet you can

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.030 
hadn't watered up your field yet you can
go<00:00:25.930> in<00:00:26.110> there<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.349> mow<00:00:26.590> it

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
go in there and mow it

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.670 
go in there and mow it
we<00:00:27.340> did<00:00:27.550> it<00:00:27.700> whatever<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.500> remember<00:00:29.500> that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
we did it whatever and remember that

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.470 
we did it whatever and remember that
this<00:00:29.800> thing<00:00:29.860> is<00:00:30.189> going<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.399> run<00:00:30.610> and<00:00:30.880> basically

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
this thing is going to run and basically

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.960 
this thing is going to run and basically
a<00:00:31.840> track<00:00:32.200> in<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:32.950> certain<00:00:33.220> track<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.790> so<00:00:33.910> you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
a track in a certain track and so you

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.090 
a track in a certain track and so you
don't<00:00:34.149> have<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.480> clear<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.809> whole<00:00:34.960> thing<00:00:35.230> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
don't have to clear the whole thing the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.040 
don't have to clear the whole thing the
water<00:00:36.309> depth<00:00:36.579> ideal<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.390> run<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.660> duck<00:00:37.840> thing

water depth ideal to run the duck thing

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.690 
water depth ideal to run the duck thing
would<00:00:38.230> be<00:00:38.380> between<00:00:38.620> five<00:00:38.950> and<00:00:38.980> ten<00:00:39.370> inches

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
would be between five and ten inches

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.910 
would be between five and ten inches
deeper<00:00:40.480> water<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.840> not<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.020> problem<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.649> can<00:00:41.679> get

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
deeper water is not a problem it can get

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.560 
deeper water is not a problem it can get

loosening this boat right here just
about<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.260> quarter<00:02:05.620> turn

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:25.850 

tightening<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:12.500> until<00:02:24.320> when<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.410> turn<00:02:25.650> that

tightening that until when you turn that
my<00:02:25.980> hand<00:02:26.220> it'll<00:02:26.970> rotate<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.480> shaft<00:02:27.690> right

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
my hand it'll rotate the shaft right

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.470 
my hand it'll rotate the shaft right
there<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.350> each<00:02:28.530> leakage<00:02:29.240> when<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.330> got

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
there of that each leakage when you got

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.510 
there of that each leakage when you got
that<00:02:30.660> done<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.380> properly<00:02:31.830> tensioned<00:02:32.100> you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
that done it's properly tensioned you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.950 
that done it's properly tensioned you
don't<00:02:32.700> want<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.880> over<00:02:33.120> tension<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
don't want to over tension it because it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.690 
don't want to over tension it because it
puts<00:02:34.230> more<00:02:34.380> load<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.830> your<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.310> your<00:02:35.520> battery

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
puts more load on your on your battery

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.940 
puts more load on your on your battery
and<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> way<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> run<00:02:37.440> down<00:02:37.650> quicker

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and that's the way to run down quicker

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.010 
and that's the way to run down quicker
so<00:02:38.850> when<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:39.090> properly<00:02:39.510> attention<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
so when that's properly attention you

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.630 
so when that's properly attention you
probably<00:02:40.440> won't<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.980> bother<00:02:41.340> with<00:02:41.490> it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
probably won't have to bother with it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.130 
probably won't have to bother with it
again<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.210> long<00:02:42.360> long<00:02:42.570> time<00:02:42.840> make<00:02:43.110> sure

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
again for a long long time make sure

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.040 
again for a long long time make sure
that's<00:02:43.590> tightened<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.070> right<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.930> once<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
that's tightened up right there once you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.440 
that's tightened up right there once you
have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> drive<00:02:46.560> motor<00:02:46.830> posts<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.850> attach

at that point you look right in left and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.200 
at that point you look right in left and
decide<00:03:07.230> which<00:03:07.470> way<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.680> want<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> pull<00:03:08.700> right

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
decide which way you want to pull right

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.660 
decide which way you want to pull right

another post in another idler pulley

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.729 
another post in another idler pulley
assembly<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.570> repeat<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.140> same<00:03:19.470> thing

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
assembly and you repeat the same thing

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.060 
assembly and you repeat the same thing
on<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.010> other<00:03:20.100> other<00:03:20.760> side<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.420> then<00:03:22.230> move

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
on the other other side and then move

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.130 
on the other other side and then move
them<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.489> need<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:24.300> increase<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
them if you need to to increase the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.570 
them if you need to to increase the
tension<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.590> belt<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.190> got<00:03:26.340> enough

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
tension on the belt so it's got enough

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.250 
tension on the belt so it's got enough
friction<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.150> drive<00:03:27.360> pulley<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.840> make

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
friction on the drive pulley to make

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.010 
friction on the drive pulley to make
this<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.500> complete<00:03:28.920> circuit<00:03:29.640> now<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.450> last<00:03:30.780> one

you set you'll use it to tension the
belt<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.209> then<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.660> always<00:03:33.840> adjust<00:03:34.140> them

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
belt and then you can always adjust them

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.140 
belt and then you can always adjust them

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
and move them if you need to you can do

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.460 
and move them if you need to you can do
that<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.700> change<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> look<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> if<00:03:43.260> it

that to change the look of it if it
doesn't<00:03:43.769> suit<00:03:43.920> you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
doesn't suit you

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.090 
doesn't suit you

or to put more tension in the belt and
have<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.489> do<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.180> can<00:03:48.330> drive<00:03:48.480> long

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
have to do that then you can drive long

end you could put a pair of decoys on

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.180 
end you could put a pair of decoys on
this<00:04:43.460> one<00:04:43.669> off<00:04:43.819> of<00:04:43.970> one<00:04:44.120> tether<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.770> we<00:04:45.770> go<00:04:45.979> all

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
this one off of one tether and we go all

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.939 
this one off of one tether and we go all
the<00:04:46.220> way<00:04:46.340> up<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.970> six<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.780> six<00:04:48.169> pack<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.620> call<00:04:48.800> it

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
the way up to six a six pack we call it

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.770 
the way up to six a six pack we call it
so<00:04:49.099> you<00:04:49.160> can<00:04:49.370> pull<00:04:49.580> six<00:04:49.940> off<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.270> one<00:04:50.419> tether<00:04:50.660> if

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
so you can pull six off of one tether if

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.960 
so you can pull six off of one tether if
you<00:04:50.870> want<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.139> use<00:04:51.289> those<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:52.310> changes<00:04:52.759> up<00:04:52.880> the

you want to use those it changes up the
way<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.180> look<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.509> way<00:04:53.810> you're<00:04:54.229> spread<00:04:54.710> loops

way you look the way you're spread loops

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.580 
way you look the way you're spread loops

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
you've got groups of because if you so

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.950 
you've got groups of because if you so
wish<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.039> have<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.729> it's<00:05:02.599> fairly

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
wish to have that and it's fairly

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.399 
wish to have that and it's fairly
inexpensive<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:05.509> have<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:05.810> rid<00:05:05.990> your<00:05:06.080> decoy

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
inexpensive you have to rid your decoy

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.620 
inexpensive you have to rid your decoy
slightly<00:05:06.979> differently<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.849> use<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.240> tethers

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
slightly differently to use the tethers

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:18.730 
slightly differently to use the tethers
in<00:05:09.560> this<00:05:09.800> case<00:05:10.069> a<00:05:15.699> swivel<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:17.870> attached<00:05:18.349> to<00:05:18.380> the

in this case a swivel is attached to the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.740 
in this case a swivel is attached to the
eye<00:05:18.800> on<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.069> decoy<00:05:19.400> or<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.300> keel<00:05:22.750> with
