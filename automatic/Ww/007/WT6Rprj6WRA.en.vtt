the design in terms of looks actually

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
the design in terms of looks actually
looks<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.869> nice<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> glossy<00:01:56.250> finish

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
looks really nice with the glossy finish

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
looks really nice with the glossy finish
along<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> matte<00:01:57.570> padding<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.829> can

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
see along the edges you have pretty much

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.100 
see along the edges you have pretty much
all<00:02:01.290> kinds<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.619> logos<00:02:01.950> across<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.509> top<00:02:03.780> and

the<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.740> thing<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.520> about<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the one thing I do not like about the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
the one thing I do not like about the
design<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> fact<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:11.009> both<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.459> left

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
design is the fact that on both the left

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.640 
design is the fact that on both the left
and<00:02:11.879> right<00:02:12.120> side<00:02:12.390> feature<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.870> glossy

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and right side feature a glossy

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
and right side feature a glossy
finish<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.129> mean<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> know<00:02:14.790> glossy<00:02:15.299> finish<00:02:15.629> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
finish I mean I know glossy finish is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.679 
finish I mean I know glossy finish is
nice<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:16.819> glossy<00:02:17.819> finishes<00:02:18.120> tend<00:02:18.510> to

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
nice and all but glossy finishes tend to

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.780 
nice and all but glossy finishes tend to
get<00:02:18.980> fingerprints<00:02:19.980> which<00:02:20.250> leaves<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.610> lot<00:02:20.760> of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
get fingerprints which leaves a lot of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.910 
get fingerprints which leaves a lot of
fingerprint<00:02:21.269> magnets<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:21.900> tend<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.799> get

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
fingerprint magnets and tend to get

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.069 
fingerprint magnets and tend to get
scratched<00:02:23.310> up<00:02:23.519> easy<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.090> mean<00:02:24.269> for<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> headset

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
to have a glossy finish on and it would

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.640 
to have a glossy finish on and it would
be<00:02:29.700> better<00:02:29.909> with<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.209> matte<00:02:30.390> finish<00:02:30.599> or<00:02:30.959> another

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
road trip I tend to be using these a bit

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.890 
road trip I tend to be using these a bit
more<00:04:43.740> often<00:04:44.100> because<00:04:44.729> just<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.419> know<00:04:45.570> hearing

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
more often because just you know hearing

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.510 
more often because just you know hearing
your<00:04:46.020> Vita<00:04:46.229> games<00:04:46.530> sound<00:04:46.860> much<00:04:47.040> more<00:04:47.070> clear

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
your Vita games sound much more clear

your Vita games sound much more clear
with<00:04:47.699> these<00:04:47.910> on<00:04:48.090> rather<00:04:48.600> than<00:04:48.750> using<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
with these on rather than using the

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.840 
with these on rather than using the
speaker's<00:04:49.620> built-in<00:04:50.010> or<00:04:50.220> just<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.550> standard

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
speaker's built-in or just a standard

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
ear but these performed a lot better so

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.530 
ear but these performed a lot better so

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
I think about the headphones first off

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.189 
I think about the headphones first off
in<00:05:26.280> terms<00:05:26.550> of<00:05:26.729> what<00:05:26.850> do<00:05:26.910> I<00:05:27.000> like<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.479> like<00:05:28.080> the

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
in terms of what do I like I like the

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.330 
in terms of what do I like I like the
fact<00:05:28.410> that<00:05:28.560> these<00:05:28.740> are<00:05:28.800> extremely

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
fact that these are extremely

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.940 
fact that these are extremely
lightweight<00:05:29.520> these<00:05:30.210> swivel<00:05:30.720> down<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.380> the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
lightweight these swivel down and the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.860 
lightweight these swivel down and the
microphone<00:05:32.669> overall<00:05:33.030> performs<00:05:33.510> really<00:05:33.720> well

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
microphone overall performs really well

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.960

the<00:05:34.680> only<00:05:34.800> thing<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.130> do<00:05:35.190> not<00:05:35.400> like<00:05:35.580> about<00:05:35.729> the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
the only thing I do not like about the

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.029 
the only thing I do not like about the
headphones<00:05:36.360> is<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.600> fact<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.110> on<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.800> left

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
headphones is the fact that on the left

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.500 
headphones is the fact that on the left
and<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.250> right<00:05:38.400> hand<00:05:38.550> side<00:05:38.669> feature<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.180> glossy

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
and the right hand side feature a glossy

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.270 
and the right hand side feature a glossy
finish<00:05:39.720> which<00:05:40.229> means<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.740> these<00:05:40.860> are<00:05:40.919> going

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
finish which means that these are going

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.960 
finish which means that these are going
to<00:05:41.400> get<00:05:41.610> scratched<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.240> very<00:05:42.599> very<00:05:42.960> easy<00:05:43.080> and<00:05:43.970> on

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
to get scratched a very very easy and on

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.120 
to get scratched a very very easy and on
the<00:05:45.270> adjustable<00:05:45.750> straps<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.590> quality<00:05:47.039> of

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
the adjustable straps the quality of

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.460 
the adjustable straps the quality of
these<00:05:47.250> don't<00:05:47.610> feel<00:05:47.910> like<00:05:48.330> up<00:05:48.599> to<00:05:48.750> par<00:05:49.020> like<00:05:49.320> it

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
these don't feel like up to par like it

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.469 
these don't feel like up to par like it
feels<00:05:49.680> like<00:05:49.860> if<00:05:50.099> you<00:05:50.280> abused<00:05:50.729> these<00:05:50.910> enough<00:05:51.240> it

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
feels like if you abused these enough it

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.180 
feels like if you abused these enough it
feels<00:05:51.840> like<00:05:51.960> these<00:05:52.080> may<00:05:52.349> snap<00:05:52.650> pretty<00:05:52.950> easily

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
feels like these may snap pretty easily

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.770 
feels like these may snap pretty easily
so<00:05:53.580> that's<00:05:53.910> one<00:05:54.120> thing<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.330> take<00:05:54.599> in
