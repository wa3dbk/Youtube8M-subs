00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
explode if you touch them so that's very

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
explode if you touch them so that's very
unfortunate<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.890> something<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
unfortunate but something really of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.589 
unfortunate but something really of
interest<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> lower<00:00:30.210> portions<00:00:30.570> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
interest here in the lower portions of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
interest here in the lower portions of
the<00:00:30.660> room<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.140> some<00:00:31.320> barrels<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.920> jars<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the room just some barrels and jars that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.310 
the room just some barrels and jars that
have<00:00:32.520> recovery<00:00:32.880> hearts<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> such<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.260> can

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
have recovery hearts and such you can

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
have recovery hearts and such you can
kill<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> skull<00:00:34.890> fish<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> get<00:00:35.610> magic

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
kill the skull fish here to get magic

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.510 
kill the skull fish here to get magic
actually<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> defeat<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.190> your

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
actually so if you defeat them with your

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
actually so if you defeat them with your
fins<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.030> whatnot<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.719> get

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
fins or whatnot you can actually get

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
fins or whatnot you can actually get
your<00:00:40.590> magic<00:00:40.950> back<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.460> don't<00:00:41.730> worry<00:00:41.790> about

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
your magic back so don't worry about

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180 
your magic back so don't worry about
running<00:00:42.450> low<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.899> these<00:00:43.530> jars<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
running low on that these jars here do

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.069 
running low on that these jars here do
have<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:45.059> arrows<00:00:45.390> though<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> run<00:00:45.989> out

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
have some arrows though if you run out

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.290

of<00:00:46.110> those<00:00:46.399> I'm<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> ride<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.850> platform

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
of those I'm going to ride this platform

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.790 
of those I'm going to ride this platform
here<00:00:48.510> upwards<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> top<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.739> to

jump<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> next<00:00:50.910> platform<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.420> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
jump over to the next platform that is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
jump over to the next platform that is
straight<00:00:51.690> ahead<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> can

there's actually a small chest that is
on<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.039> mini-map<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> look<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
on your mini-map if you look over to the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.670 
on your mini-map if you look over to the
right<00:00:57.629> you'll<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.079> there<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.289> actually

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

right you'll see that there is actually
a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:59.010> alcove<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.760> hiding<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.270> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
a little alcove that is hiding there in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.670 
a little alcove that is hiding there in
the<00:01:00.510> corner<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.140> hookshot<00:01:01.320> to

either the torch or the chest itself and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.270 
either the torch or the chest itself and
then<00:01:03.899> open<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.379> find<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> tenth<00:01:04.949> straight

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
then open it to find the tenth straight

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.140 
then open it to find the tenth straight
ferry<00:01:07.130> once<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> hop

back<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.100> platform<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:12.060> up

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
back up to that platform to get back up

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
back up to that platform to get back up
there

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
there

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
always kind of bothered me like there's
nothing<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.600> draining<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> water<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
nothing that's draining the water out of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
nothing that's draining the water out of
here<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.040> tons<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.490> water<00:01:20.610> that's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
here but there's tons of water that's
flowing<00:01:21.060> into<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.600> room<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> mean<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.710> main

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
flowing into this room I mean the main
room<00:01:23.159> has<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.549> water<00:01:23.790> flowing<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
room has all this water flowing into it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.539 
room has all this water flowing into it
and<00:01:24.720> there's<00:01:25.049> also<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> waterfall<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.340> my

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and there's also a waterfall like my

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
and there's also a waterfall like my
goodness<00:01:26.820> there's<00:01:27.270> isn't<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.810> wouldn't<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
goodness there's isn't that wouldn't it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.249 
goodness there's isn't that wouldn't it
flood<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.770> crazy<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> doesn't

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
flood like crazy in here but it doesn't

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
flood like crazy in here but it doesn't
video<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.470> logic<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:33.060> once<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> get

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
video game logic for you so once you get

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.880 
video game logic for you so once you get
to<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> end<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.320> dead<00:01:34.500> end<00:01:34.530> you'll

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to the end here it's a dead end you'll

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
to the end here it's a dead end you'll
see<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.490> paddles<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> are

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
see that there's paddles here that are

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
see that there's paddles here that are
powered<00:01:36.810> by<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.020> waterfall<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.070> rotating

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
powered by a waterfall that is rotating

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.010 
powered by a waterfall that is rotating
the<00:01:38.700> water<00:01:38.880> wheel<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.450> there's<00:01:39.600> only<00:01:39.810> some

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the water wheel so if there's only some

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
the water wheel so if there's only some
way<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> stop<00:01:40.829> spinning<00:01:41.750> now<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
way we can make it stop spinning now to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.450 
way we can make it stop spinning now to
shoot<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> waterfall<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> nice<00:01:44.040> arrow<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
shoot the waterfall with a nice arrow to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.160 
shoot the waterfall with a nice arrow to
freeze<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.060> jump<00:01:45.450> onto<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> paddles

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
freeze it and then jump onto the paddles

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
freeze it and then jump onto the paddles
once<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.560> stop<00:01:46.770> moving<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.610> then

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
once they stop moving which you can then

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.399 
once they stop moving which you can then
use<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.030> reach<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> next<00:01:48.780> door

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
use to reach the next door

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
use to reach the next door
but<00:01:50.100> first<00:01:50.430> you'll<00:01:51.000> notice<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.420> there<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but first you'll notice that there is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240 
but first you'll notice that there is
still<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> chest<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.530> mini-map<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> want

still a chest on your mini-map you want

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
still a chest on your mini-map you want
to<00:01:53.310> turn<00:01:53.399> off<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.390> climb<00:01:54.630> onto

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
to turn off to the right then climb onto

fire arrows and ice arrows to melt or
freeze<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.970> waterfalls<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.170> mess<00:02:47.320> up<00:02:47.350> now

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
freeze the waterfalls if you mess up now

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.470 
freeze the waterfalls if you mess up now
the<00:02:48.190> goal<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.580> use<00:02:48.790> them<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.090> reach<00:02:49.270> the

green platform on the far west and use

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.940 
green platform on the far west and use
the<00:02:51.820> giant<00:02:52.030> switch<00:02:52.770> it's<00:02:53.770> pretty

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the giant switch it's pretty

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.470 
the giant switch it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.910> like<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> say<00:02:55.300> if<00:02:55.390> you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
self-explanatory and like I say if you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.610 
self-explanatory and like I say if you
messed<00:02:55.660> up<00:02:55.780> you'll<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:55.960> have<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.230> use<00:02:56.260> the

have<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.390> like<00:04:54.630> hit<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.260> bubble<00:04:55.770> right<00:04:55.980> in<00:04:56.100> the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
have to like hit the bubble right in the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.710 
have to like hit the bubble right in the
middle<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.670> for<00:04:56.910> an<00:04:56.970> order<00:04:57.180> for<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:57.480> work

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
middle of it for an order for it to work

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.720 
middle of it for an order for it to work
so<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:58.110> actually<00:04:58.470> think<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:58.980> easier<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.550> pop

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
so I actually think it's easier to pop

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.730 
so I actually think it's easier to pop
the<00:04:59.850> bubble<00:05:00.120> first<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:01.170> disadvantage<00:05:01.620> of

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
the bubble first the disadvantage of

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.290 
the bubble first the disadvantage of
this<00:05:01.950> way<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.850> straight<00:05:03.120> brain

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
this way is that the straight brain

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.730 
this way is that the straight brain
starts<00:05:03.540> floating<00:05:03.810> around<00:05:03.870> in<00:05:04.080> circle<00:05:04.440> but<00:05:04.620> you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
starts floating around in circle but you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.990 
starts floating around in circle but you
just<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.070> barely<00:05:05.310> touch<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.760> for<00:05:05.880> two

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
just have to barely touch it for two

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.910 
just have to barely touch it for two
counts<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:06.510> alternatively<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:07.830> also

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
counts so alternatively you can also

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.620 
counts so alternatively you can also
just<00:05:08.280> stand<00:05:08.460> on<00:05:08.550> top<00:05:08.730> of<00:05:08.790> the<00:05:09.000> green<00:05:09.210> pipe<00:05:09.450> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
just stand on top of the green pipe and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.940 
just stand on top of the green pipe and
where<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.840> great<00:05:09.990> various<00:05:10.260> mast<00:05:10.470> real<00:05:10.710> that

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
where the great various mast real that

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.620 
where the great various mast real that
straight<00:05:11.760> variant<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.210> takes<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.510> little

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
straight variant that takes a little

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.570 
straight variant that takes a little
while<00:05:12.810> now<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:13.770> want<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:13.920> re-enter<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.280> final

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
while now you want to re-enter the final

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.770 
while now you want to re-enter the final
room<00:05:14.700> and<00:05:14.880> float<00:05:15.030> up<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.240> top<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.690> you'll

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
room and float up to the top and you'll

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.270 
room and float up to the top and you'll
see<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.230> last<00:05:16.470> straight<00:05:16.710> berry<00:05:16.950> is<00:05:17.070> in<00:05:17.190> a

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
see that the last straight berry is in a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.600 
see that the last straight berry is in a
bubble

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
bubble

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.130 
bubble
underneath<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:18.120> platform<00:05:18.600> but<00:05:18.780> how<00:05:18.930> do<00:05:18.990> we

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
underneath this platform but how do we

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.800 
underneath this platform but how do we
get<00:05:19.320> it<00:05:19.700> go<00:05:20.700> stand<00:05:20.940> on<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.090> green<00:05:21.240> pipe<00:05:21.450> nearby

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
