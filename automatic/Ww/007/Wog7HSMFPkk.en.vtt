00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.910
 you know why the so-called cars 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.069
 segment there are the most sold in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.349
 europe I will answer by looking at the new one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.210
 peugeot 308 that five-door 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.980
 it's not too big and outside a spacious one 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.150
 in another complete, in short, that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.100
 everyone should like it a little 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.619
 and we'll see in this why to buy it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.619
 but if the formula works out like 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.609
 just to please the tastes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 more customers possible 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.660
 the French designers have not trod the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.460
 hand on luca of the 308 which is a lot 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.840
 classic and elegant 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.309
 even more so if you choose to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.309
 dark color like this blue 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.330
 useless a little German is sober 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.400
 in the frontal part than in the rear one 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.260
 which gives the idea of ​​robustness and then there is 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.270
 the hi tech touch of the front headlights the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.380
 full led standard on the stand 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.060
 leader is spacious the 308 is 4 meters long 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.070
 and twenty-five something less respect 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.990
 to the main competitors but this 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.680
 it does not mean that we give up space 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.680
 rather 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.950
 trunk with 420 liters is among the most 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840
 great in the category to a good one 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.670
 load threshold but above all and well 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.079
 usable in depth in height 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 even if the floor is not completely 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.590
 dish 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 inside it goes up well thanks to the turn door 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.960
 enlarged and cut horizontally there 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.000
 a good space for the legs and for the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.860
 head while the central tunnel limits 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 a bit the habitability of the fifth place 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.770
 seat however remains comfortable for all 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 rear passengers and quality 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.800
 worst is ever more attentive to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.330
 quality perceived above all with his 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.920
 latest generations of cars e 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 this 308 is no less 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.660
 says six of the dashboard and minimalist but 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.000
 also technological they call it ai 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.650
 cockpit are a few buttons and one 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.720
 touch screen that contains a bit of everything 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.670
 the aesthetic is impactful and transmits one 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.380
 good feeling of quality also because 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.570
 all plastics are soft and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.190
 pleasant to touch and then as on 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 last peugeot there is the small steering wheel 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.450
 with the instrumentation it is moved upwards 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.979
 you have to get used to it but then it becomes easy 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.870
 find the driving position thanks 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.760
 to the numerous seat adjustments 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.290
 then there are the storage compartments and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.240
 bottle holder in the run to the central 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.470
 we are not at the levels of a minivan but 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.970
 a space is not lacking also thanks 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.860
 to the elimination of some commands 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.380
 integrated in the central screen 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.120
 finally it is worth to spend 550 euros 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.440
 for the panoramic glass roof because 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.900
 makes traveling very enjoyable and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.180
 especially for those sitting behind 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.330
 how the browser works the screen 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.880
 touchscreen is huge measuring 9.7 inches 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.440
 and it is fundamental because it controls both 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.900
 the automatic climate control that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.160
 the computer science of 308 or the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.230
 on-board computer 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.420
 the phone with speakerphone and then again the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.000
 radio and multimedia section and of course 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.519
 the navigator that offers all the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.060
 functionality of gps models always in 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.060
 touch mode 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 of city as it goes 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.460
 the dimensions are not too difficult 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.230
 to handle in traffic is not a city 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.010
 car is true but the dimensions do not exist 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 they will make life impossible 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.750
 visibility in the parking lot is not 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.450
 perfect because rear window is a 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.490
 small the 450 euros required for the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.660
 however, park assist is well spent because 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.660
 there is also a reversing camera 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.920
 and beautiful to drive 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.349
 these 308 to driving behavior 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.849
 very sincere, always stable and never 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.470
 brusque even when its strength a little 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.420
 on cornering you really feel that the new one 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.340
 modular platform is lighter and the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.840
 sacred hard but without compromising the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.670
 truly appreciable comfort 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.220
 despite the circles are 17 inches 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.780
 so large but not over the top as of 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.110
 usually it happens on the stands more 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.540
 wealthy 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.310
 the three-cylinder petrol engine I was at 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.530
 130 horses that are not few 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.959
 considering that it is a 1200 il 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.980
 turbo then is very gradual and helps 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.930
 enjoy everybody 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.609
 steering it to an easy answer thanks 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.379
 also to the variable ratio that of 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.629
 series with a steering wheel so small then i 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.669
 changes of direction are instantaneous and 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.530
 every now and then she even took to playing with it 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.209
 a little for how simple it is to manage 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.400
 and at this point you will have to press the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.960
 sport key in this way the engine is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.970
 quicker the sound more down 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.310
 engaging and instrumentation yes 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.699
 lights up red with the tachometer it is 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.699
 in reverse 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.169
 the gearbox is a six-speed manual with i 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.970
 fair relationships and grafts a lot 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.440
 precise sin only for the lever that has 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:51.320
 the run a little too long as 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.990
 consumes this new 308 and lighter 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.820
 of about 140 kg compared to the past and the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.340
 downsizing of the 1200 motor allows 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.889
 declared consumption of 4.6 liters per 100 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.630
 kilometers or about 21 km liter 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.460
 but if you want to get a realistic idea 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.410
 of what you can consume in 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.150
 worst conditions of use or 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.570
 in the city you know that consumption is 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.990
 they are as high as 6.1 liters per 100 km 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.479
 it will cost the 308 he drove is the 1200 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.520
 and thp allure from 130 horses 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.860
 the top of the range for this engine a 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.150
 three cylinders and this version starts from 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.800
 22,800 euros 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.330
 if instead you want to spend something in 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.460
 less but keep a lot of preparation 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.780
 complete as the active here starts from 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.820
 21 thousand euros for the same 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.310
 motorization level lenses of the range 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.160
 308 instead starts with 1200 always a 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.650
 18,500 euro petrol and the top of the 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.150
 range instead the non plus ultra is 2000 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.520
 turbodiesel with automatic transmission e 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.440
 27,750 euros for homework faults is needed 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.940
 nice to look at but I find it excessive to do 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.100
 switch all car management 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.479
 the climate through the central screen 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.039
 for example I would have let him have i 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.520
 physical keys on the old dashboard 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.680
 way 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.450
 then the voice commands are missing that su 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.970
 other cars are very comfortable to manage 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.760
 phone and browser what is the version 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.740
 better if four out of 10 customers 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.930
 choose a 308 petrol one reason there 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.639
 it will be a pleasant and fuel-efficient engine 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.950
 do not overdo it and have your neck pulled 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.479
 or if you don't travel often full load 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.160
 but if you grind many kilometers 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.380
 at the best time to focus on the 1600 diesel 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.250
 from 115 horses maybe in the preparation 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.349
 business would recommend it size 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.849
 ideal so much balanced design 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.310
 technology and a range of engines 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.590
 complete the peugeot 308 puts on the table 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.389
 a menu of very tasty contents but 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.979
 as often happens the diners do not 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.389
 they are watching at his table sit 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.770
 in fact the illustrious competitors as for 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.870
 example alfa romeo giulietta o 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.000
 volkswagen golf to name a few 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.500
 308, however, has a lot of handling 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.240
 pleasant to drive a quality 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.010
 high constructive and a version 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.669
 very good health if you like 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.669
 a first choice
