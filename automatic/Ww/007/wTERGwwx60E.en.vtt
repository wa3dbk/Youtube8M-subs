00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.900
 print 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.120
 I think it's a great level with the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.730
 players 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.160
 and I believe that now we are going to pass a 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.529
 new stage with a lot of desire to win 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.330
 something for chili and I hope it's 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.740
 the Cuban that that as well the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.210

 home if the university is very nice that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.439
 has a radio played and I hope that it 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.570
 can stay at home and how you compare 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.770
 level of South American football with the 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.649
 European football 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.710
 well I've been in several leagues of 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.469
 europe and I think it will make more similar of 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.600
 the americas I think the Italian eni 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.750
 and the comparison of Italian football in 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.510
 Spanish like which one you feel 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.640
 more comfortable loose liano Spanish fire 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.579
 exactly as comfortable to all the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.070
 league and what the team needs I see that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.249

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.220
