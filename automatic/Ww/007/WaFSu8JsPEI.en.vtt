your brake lines are bad they're
cracking<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.210> probably<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:54.960> they're

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
cracking this is probably what they're

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.100 
cracking this is probably what they're

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
to get that done and fixed as soon as

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.749 
to get that done and fixed as soon as
you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.689> now<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> ordered<00:02:02.040> brake<00:02:02.250> lines<00:02:02.520> from

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you can now I ordered brake lines from

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.660 
you can now I ordered brake lines from
one<00:02:02.969> line<00:02:03.350> replace<00:02:04.350> those<00:02:04.680> brake<00:02:05.070> lines<00:02:05.340> these

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
one line replace those brake lines these

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.340 
one line replace those brake lines these
brake<00:02:05.969> lines<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> date<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.140> it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
brake lines actually have a date on it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.550

the<00:02:07.920> date<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:09.289> July<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:11.540> 97<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.989> these<00:02:13.260> brake

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the date is July of 97 so these brake

rare<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:33.940> rear<00:02:34.360> brake<00:02:34.660> guys<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.319> car

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
rare now the rear brake guys in this car

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.400 
rare now the rear brake guys in this car
doesn't<00:02:36.220> fluctuate<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.299> have<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.019> wear

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
doesn't fluctuate and have this wear

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.949 
doesn't fluctuate and have this wear
problem<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.849> they<00:02:40.329> didn't<00:02:40.660> need<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.780> be

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
problem so they didn't need to be

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.319 
problem so they didn't need to be
replaced<00:02:41.379> but<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.829> front<00:02:42.190> ones<00:02:42.370> did<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:42.910> I

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
replaced but the front ones did and I

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.449 
replaced but the front ones did and I
would<00:02:43.780> imagine<00:02:44.049> that's<00:02:44.379> likely<00:02:44.920> when<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.159> lot

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
would imagine that's likely when a lot

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.930 
would imagine that's likely when a lot
of<00:02:45.640> front-wheel<00:02:46.180> drive<00:02:46.209> cars<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:48.129> if<00:02:48.459> the

of front-wheel drive cars so if the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.030 
of front-wheel drive cars so if the

can go ahead and ask by the way after I
replace<00:03:09.400> these<00:03:09.609> brake<00:03:09.970> lines<00:03:10.049> with<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.230> new

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
replace these brake lines with the new

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.610 
replace these brake lines with the new
ones<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.129> car<00:03:12.459> actually<00:03:12.790> seems<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:14.049> break<00:03:14.319> a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
ones the car actually seems to break a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.949 
ones the car actually seems to break a
lot<00:03:14.980> better<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.910> don't<00:03:16.030> have<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.420> push<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
lot better you don't have to push on the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.870 
lot better you don't have to push on the
pedal<00:03:17.260> as<00:03:17.379> hard<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.890> get<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> same<00:03:18.579> braking

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
pedal as hard to get the same braking

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.970 
pedal as hard to get the same braking
force<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.870> imagine<00:03:20.139> these<00:03:20.500> glands<00:03:20.769> were

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
force so I imagine these glands were

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.250 
force so I imagine these glands were
swelling<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.639> little<00:03:21.910> bit<00:03:22.090> under<00:03:22.780> pressure<00:03:23.049> as

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
swelling a little bit under pressure as

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.069 
swelling a little bit under pressure as
well<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:24.010> there<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.090> have<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.299> replace<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
well so there you have it replace the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.990 
well so there you have it replace the
brake<00:03:26.290> lines<00:03:26.530> if<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.130> mechanic<00:03:27.549> recommends

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.449 
brake lines if the mechanic recommends
it<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.870> matter<00:03:29.169> of<00:03:29.260> fact<00:03:29.380> if<00:03:29.919> you<00:03:30.130> take<00:03:30.310> your

car in for a brake job you can ask the
