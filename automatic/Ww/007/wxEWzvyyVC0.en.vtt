different solutions but they decided to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.010 
different solutions but they decided to
go<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:51.390> probably

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
go with this which is actually probably

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.319
