this voice all about well essentially it
is<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:23.890> smaller<00:00:26.380> Xperia<00:00:27.380> Arc<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:28.190> screen<00:00:28.490> is

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
is a smaller Xperia Arc the screen is

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.540 
is a smaller Xperia Arc the screen is
2.3<00:00:29.390> inches

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.130 

big<00:00:32.379> it<00:00:33.379> has<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:34.040> similar<00:00:34.899> mobile<00:00:35.899> bravia

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
big it has a similar mobile bravia

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.710 
big it has a similar mobile bravia
engine<00:00:36.410> technology<00:00:37.129> in<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:38.239> runs<00:00:38.480> 1

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
engine technology in it it runs 1

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.009 
engine technology in it it runs 1
gigahertz<00:00:38.989> processor<00:00:39.199> there's<00:00:39.879> 300<00:00:40.989> MB<00:00:41.989> of

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
gigahertz processor there's 300 MB of

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.710 
gigahertz processor there's 300 MB of
internal<00:00:42.680> storage<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:45.470> also<00:00:45.649> an<00:00:45.920> 8.1

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
internal storage this is also an 8.1

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.329 
internal storage this is also an 8.1
megapixel<00:00:48.400> camera<00:00:49.400> shoots<00:00:49.760> 720p<00:00:50.800> videos<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
megapixel camera shoots 720p videos and

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.450 
megapixel camera shoots 720p videos and
it<00:00:52.940> also<00:00:53.150> has<00:00:53.329> eczema<00:00:53.960> are<00:00:54.230> at<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.100> same<00:00:55.250> time

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
it also has eczema are at the same time

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.549 
it also has eczema are at the same time
there's<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:56.059> secondary<00:00:56.690> microphone<00:00:56.930> noise

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
there's a secondary microphone noise

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.670 
there's a secondary microphone noise
cancellation<00:00:58.220> so<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.260> roughly<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.290> same

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
cancellation so it is roughly the same

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.430 
cancellation so it is roughly the same
as<00:01:01.479> as<00:01:02.479> an<00:01:02.690> expert<00:01:03.160> in<00:01:05.140> terms<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.259> features

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
as as an expert in terms of features

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.380 
as as an expert in terms of features
again<00:01:07.160> it's<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.399> same<00:01:07.580> as<00:01:07.729> just<00:01:07.880> it<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.180> has

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
again it's the same as just it just has

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.440 
again it's the same as just it just has
a<00:01:08.420> smaller<00:01:08.780> screen<00:01:09.369> but<00:01:10.369> but<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.179> screen

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
a smaller screen but but the screen

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.260 
a smaller screen but but the screen
density<00:01:11.960> because<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.700> expiry<00:01:13.700> has<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.910> smaller

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
density because the expiry has a smaller

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.469 
density because the expiry has a smaller
screen<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.660> 3.3<00:01:15.380> inch<00:01:15.560> screen<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:17.300> has<00:01:17.450> a

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
screen a 3.3 inch screen it has a

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.510 
screen a 3.3 inch screen it has a
similar<00:01:18.880> resolution<00:01:20.380> 854<00:01:21.380> x<00:01:21.440> 480<00:01:22.070> which<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.490> a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
similar resolution 854 x 480 which is a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.990 
similar resolution 854 x 480 which is a
similar<00:01:22.789> as<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.630> Xperia<00:01:24.320> Arc<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.789> means

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
similar as the Xperia Arc so that means

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.859 
similar as the Xperia Arc so that means
the<00:01:26.770> density<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.920> pixel<00:01:28.310> density<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:28.940> for

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the density the pixel density for for

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.399 
the density the pixel density for for
the<00:01:29.960> Xperia

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the Xperia

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.809 
the Xperia
ray<00:01:32.039> is<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.569> I<00:01:34.640> don't<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.700> what

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
ray is really good and I don't know what

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you can see it on the on the video but

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.929 
you can see it on the on the video but

you know using the naked eye it's it's a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.319 
you know using the naked eye it's it's a
