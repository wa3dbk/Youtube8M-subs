00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
behind I went I googled the asparagus

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.670 
behind I went I googled the asparagus
just<00:01:24.780> because<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.200> something<00:01:25.409> less<00:01:25.650> than

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just because it was something less than

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
just because it was something less than
I<00:01:25.890> talked<00:01:26.189> about<00:01:26.460> neither<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> us<00:01:27.090> found

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
I talked about neither one of us found

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.020 
I talked about neither one of us found
the<00:01:27.509> time<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> found

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the time to do it and when I found

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
the time to do it and when I found
pictures<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> realized<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.650> was

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pictures of it I realized that there was

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.580 
pictures of it I realized that there was
a<00:01:31.770> plan<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> back<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.790> our<00:01:32.939> yard<00:01:33.560> by<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
a plan in the back of our yard by the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.219 
a plan in the back of our yard by the
old<00:01:34.890> barn<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:36.180> Leslie<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.689> had<00:01:36.810> noticed

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
old barn that Leslie and I had noticed

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
old barn that Leslie and I had noticed
and<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> thought<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.189> dill<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> she

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and I thought it was dill and she

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.380 
and I thought it was dill and she
thought<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> fennel<00:01:41.119> but<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> looked

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
thought it was a fennel but it looked

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
thought it was a fennel but it looked
like<00:01:42.540> something<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
like something that was not you know a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
like something that was not you know a
wild<00:01:44.880> plant<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.420> much<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.890> realized<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
wild plant so much and I realized that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.569 
wild plant so much and I realized that
that<00:01:47.610> was<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> asparagus<00:01:49.189> because<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.369> went

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that was the asparagus because I went

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.039 
that was the asparagus because I went
out<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.970> saw<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:51.659> completely

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
out there I saw that it was completely

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
covered in poison ivy it's an area of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.340 
covered in poison ivy it's an area of
our<00:01:54.180> yard<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:54.659> there's<00:01:54.869> poison<00:01:55.140> ivy

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
our yard where there's poison ivy

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.240 
our yard where there's poison ivy
everywhere<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:58.170> knew<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.530> once<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.070> know

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
everywhere and I knew that once you know

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
everywhere and I knew that once you know
we<00:01:59.430> let<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> go<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.719> poison<00:02:01.049> ivy<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
we let it go the poison ivy would get so

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200 
we let it go the poison ivy would get so
dense<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.189> couldn't<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.759> there<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> was

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
dense we couldn't get in there it was

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.020 
dense we couldn't get in there it was
already<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:04.040> covering<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
already you know covering it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.180 
already you know covering it
it<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.450> early<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.079> spring<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it was early you know spring so I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740 
it was early you know spring so I
decided<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:08.970> had<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
decided you know we just had to go do it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.999 
decided you know we just had to go do it
so<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:09.989> dropped<00:02:10.229> everything<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.950> were

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so we dropped everything that we were

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
so we dropped everything that we were
doing<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.209> what<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.480> were

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
doing and like that was what we were

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
doing and like that was what we were
going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.020> day<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.440> they

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
going to do that day is they

ivy isn't nearly as deep and have some
experience<00:04:40.340> this<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.150> very<00:04:41.360> similar<00:04:41.660> I

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
experience this is a very similar I

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.200 
experience this is a very similar I
think<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.669> two<00:04:44.139> bamboo<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.699> seems<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.090> be

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
think to two bamboo so it seems to be

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.850 
think to two bamboo so it seems to be
three<00:04:47.479> major<00:04:47.720> plants<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.560> don't<00:04:48.620> know<00:04:48.740> how

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
three major plants and I don't know how

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.070 
three major plants and I don't know how
many<00:04:49.060> crowns<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.360> stuff<00:04:50.630> we'll<00:04:50.780> get<00:04:50.960> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
many crowns and stuff we'll get to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.340 
many crowns and stuff we'll get to
divide<00:04:51.350> out<00:04:51.620> of<00:04:51.800> them<00:04:56.020> we're<00:04:57.020> reading<00:04:57.199> the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
divide out of them we're reading the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.029 
divide out of them we're reading the
roots<00:04:57.560> can<00:04:57.770> be<00:04:57.919> wired<00:04:58.160> up<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.340> 10<00:04:58.639> feet<00:04:58.850> deep

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:34.700

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
so one of the things that we had to do

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.950 
so one of the things that we had to do

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
here there's an old fence post here

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.000

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
flopped it for the asparagus and test it

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
was the fence full bull here at the end

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.320 
was the fence full bull here at the end
of<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.340> dig<00:06:03.340> that<00:06:03.520> up<00:06:04.470> underneath<00:06:05.470> of<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:06.330> we

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
of it dig that up underneath of that we

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.560 
of it dig that up underneath of that we
want<00:06:07.540> to<00:06:07.660> cut<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.020> fence<00:06:08.260> around<00:06:08.590> the

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
want to cut the fence around the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:25.500 
want to cut the fence around the
asparagus<00:06:22.320> about<00:06:23.320> a<00:06:23.350> pipe<00:06:23.680> RL<00:06:24.390> to<00:06:25.390> the

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
asparagus about a pipe RL to the

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:35.580 
asparagus about a pipe RL to the
asparagus<00:06:26.050> unfortunately<00:06:27.990> standing<00:06:34.410> on<00:06:35.410> the

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
asparagus unfortunately standing on the

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.790 
asparagus unfortunately standing on the
fence<00:06:36.690> we're<00:06:37.690> going<00:06:37.900> to<00:06:37.960> do<00:06:38.020> is<00:06:38.140> cut<00:06:38.380> it<00:06:38.530> along

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
fence we're going to do is cut it along

00:06:38.800 --> 00:07:19.559 
fence we're going to do is cut it along
here<00:06:39.450> and<00:06:40.450> then<00:06:40.540> we<00:06:40.630> can<00:06:40.810> lift<00:06:41.020> it

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:19.569 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:23.529 

so<00:07:20.569> it's<00:07:20.690> a<00:07:20.750> poison<00:07:21.139> ivy<00:07:21.319> and<00:07:21.650> the<00:07:22.419> barbed<00:07:23.419> wire

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:23.539 
so it's a poison ivy and the barbed wire

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:35.920 
so it's a poison ivy and the barbed wire
isn't<00:07:23.990> exactly<00:07:24.590> free<00:07:26.289> asparagus<00:07:34.810> make<00:07:35.810> sure

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
isn't exactly free asparagus make sure

isn't exactly free asparagus make sure
we<00:07:36.020> don't<00:07:36.139> leave<00:07:36.319> our<00:07:36.470> tools<00:07:36.800> out<00:07:37.069> hands
