00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
vanos unit that the the the clearance

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.170 
vanos unit that the the the clearance
the<00:01:30.689> factory<00:01:31.140> clearance<00:01:31.680> between<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.880> prong

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the factory clearance between this prong

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
the factory clearance between this prong
and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> opening<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> hole<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.770> had

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and the opening of the hole here had

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.849 
and the opening of the hole here had
widened<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.179> little<00:01:36.450> bit<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> buy<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
widened a little bit so when you buy the

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.469 
widened a little bit so when you buy the
car<00:01:38.070> brand<00:01:38.340> new<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.700> pretty<00:01:38.939> good<00:01:39.149> they're

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
car brand new it's pretty good they're

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:39.980 
car brand new it's pretty good they're
quiet

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
quiet

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.719 
quiet
but<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.469> you<00:01:40.619> drive<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> obviously

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
but as you drive it obviously

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.599 
but as you drive it obviously
metal-on-metal<00:01:42.210> wears<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.159> clearance

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
metal-on-metal wears so the clearance

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.440 
metal-on-metal wears so the clearance
between<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:45.390> hole<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.439> problem<00:01:47.450> had

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
between that hole and this problem had

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.239 
between that hole and this problem had
grown<00:01:48.749> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> notice<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
grown a little bit so if you notice if I

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:51.859 
grown a little bit so if you notice if I
just<00:01:50.490> put<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.789> into<00:01:50.999> this<00:01:51.119> hole<00:01:51.359> you<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.719> see

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
just put this into this hole you can see

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.489 
just put this into this hole you can see
how<00:01:51.929> much<00:01:52.049> plays<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.380> what

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
how much plays in there is that what

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.230 
how much plays in there is that what
makes<00:01:55.679> that<00:01:55.829> rascal<00:01:56.399> causes<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> rattle

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
makes that rascal causes it to rattle

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
makes that rascal causes it to rattle
because<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.749> base<00:01:57.869> unit<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> engine<00:01:59.219> revs

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
because the base unit as the engine revs

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.489 
because the base unit as the engine revs
up<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.789> down<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.329> vanos<00:02:00.689> unit<00:02:00.719> will<00:02:01.079> load<00:02:01.319> the

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
up and down the vanos unit will load the

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.899 
up and down the vanos unit will load the
pump<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.069> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.249> load<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.609> back<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
pump one way and then load it back the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.410 
pump one way and then load it back the
other<00:02:03.030> way

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
other way

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.050 
other way
much<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.189> much<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.579> instance<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
much like much like for instance a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
much like much like for instance a
camshaft<00:02:06.539> on<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.200> valve<00:02:07.619> spring<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
camshaft on a valve spring it's going to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
camshaft on a valve spring it's going to
come<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.270> load<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:09.869> pop<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.770> over

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
come in to load and then pop and go over

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.590 
come in to load and then pop and go over
let<00:02:11.370> me<00:02:11.460> come<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> load<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.120> pop<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.450> over

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
let me come in to load and pop it over

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.630 
let me come in to load and pop it over
so<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> motor<00:02:13.350> revs<00:02:13.590> up<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.890> down<00:02:14.010> that'll

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
so as the motor revs up and down that'll

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.860 
so as the motor revs up and down that'll
happen<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:15.480> you're<00:02:15.600> hearing

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
happen so that's what you're hearing

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.240 
happen so that's what you're hearing
right<00:02:15.990> there<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.770> were<00:02:16.920> talking<00:02:17.040> about

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
right there now you were talking about

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.110 
right there now you were talking about
the<00:02:17.730> dock

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the dock

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.930 
the dock
vanos<00:02:18.540> rebuild<00:02:19.170> yeah<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.310> med<00:02:20.519> went<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
vanos rebuild yeah so a med went and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.970 
vanos rebuild yeah so a med went and
bought<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.450> before<00:02:22.050> he<00:02:22.260> had<00:02:22.410> problems<00:02:22.709> he

bought the before he had problems he

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.920 
bought the before he had problems he
caught<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> before<00:02:23.760> he<00:02:24.120> had<00:02:24.209> problems<00:02:24.599> he<00:02:24.629> went

caught it before he had problems he went
and<00:02:25.019> got<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.500> vanishing<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.310> rebuilt

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and got the vanishing a rebuilt

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.640 
and got the vanishing a rebuilt
remanufacture<00:02:27.569> vanishing<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.140> from<00:02:28.530> dr.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
remanufacture vanishing it from dr.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.150 
remanufacture vanishing it from dr.
vanos<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:30.150> noticed<00:02:30.569> right<00:02:30.750> away<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
vanos and we noticed right away that the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.020 
vanos and we noticed right away that the
holes<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.730> are<00:02:32.790> bored<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.489> oil<00:02:35.489> pump<00:02:35.790> in

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
most people that have these cars get to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.170

experience that rattle noise especially

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.619 
experience that rattle noise especially
on<00:03:03.540> startup<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.470> it'd<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.620> nice<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.129> that

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
on startup so it'd be nice to have that

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:14.050 
on startup so it'd be nice to have that
better

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060
