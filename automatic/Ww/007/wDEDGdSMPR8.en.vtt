00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.920
 it comes alone peugeot presented 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.550
 a video in which I use access disks to the cash network 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.719
 and sat 2 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.449
 although if I do not believe 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.799
 to connect to the internet theater 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.799
 not sure that a sequel to the first video that had put on youtube 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.550
 so we also at first the deputy of saÃ´ne-et-loire where we 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.949
 feel that you'll see 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.949
 so why do you see me 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.700
 for me it's a global growth center 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
 so I liked it 3 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 so we go below forum is excluded 2 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 so the game will run in high definition 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.920
 We care about trotski scale 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.050
 so I will not go to invite you so far you may already know a 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.130
 rusk 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 so play in the eure where the connections 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.220
 I'm going to their advanced option 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 I configure an external device 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.010
 lucho a memory card 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.440
 so we did not want to have done an oppressive that these three airports 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 metros connection so we chose the production 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.320
 and water plane to enter the ip network device country address in 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.940
 the occurrence on the need of gogol that I'm going to put so employees 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 who pay these 216 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 216 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.889
 239 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.829
 59,104 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.339
 59 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.919
 104 in Mauritania 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.099
 move to sing a few titles these words noting that the production is done 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.840
 well you'll see the built-in browser is pretty basic we collaborate 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 the mouse 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.889
 so we changed his good news 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.879
 unpublished in e1 we will see if we can listen to music you already have 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.929
 tried 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:09.119
 in such an area where I do not have unanimity and it does not work so we 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.799
 will go to the website 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 two analysts 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.969
 while I was wrong 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.629
 so seeing it at the bottom indicates that its load simply 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.519
 so yes I am only shareholder of the three hills breaking the head on 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.519
 look for something else 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.579
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.209
 I especially hope it will work because in their video room so 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.529
 red that did not walk 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.269
 while I had but if she is sure it's better so maybe that 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.269
 it's a country that counts can not do not know 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.529
 here we are so it's still planted I'm sorry 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:18.759
 it does not work so that on the playstation 3 does not work on the 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.439
 possession of his walk 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.439
 rd i'm excited that shortly 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.980
 so good I hope that already it opens more windy a little 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.240
 that we can go on the track and I love you on a sofa kpc channel 3 with 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.629
 the network access disk 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:35.789
 and percent 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.219
 and so that's actually it's afterwards the collection program got all 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.319
 simply
