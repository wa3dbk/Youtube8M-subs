your<00:00:14.610> slab<00:00:14.790> you're<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.209> to<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.450> using<00:00:15.629> your

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
your slab you're going to be using your

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080 
your slab you're going to be using your
wedge<00:00:16.410> ball<00:00:16.800> clay<00:00:17.100> which<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:17.970> an

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
wedge ball clay which you can see in an

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.830 
wedge ball clay which you can see in an
earlier<00:00:18.420> video<00:00:18.630> entitled<00:00:19.320> wedging<00:00:20.250> clay<00:00:20.840> I'm

earlier video entitled wedging clay I'm

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.390 
earlier video entitled wedging clay I'm
going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> show<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.380> two<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:22.710> methods

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
going to show you two different methods

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.579 
going to show you two different methods
and<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.480> decide<00:00:24.779> which<00:00:24.929> one<00:00:25.140> works<00:00:25.320> best

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589 
and you can decide which one works best

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.259 
and you can decide which one works best
for<00:00:25.679> you<00:00:25.919> and<00:00:26.099> depending<00:00:26.669> on<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> materials

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
for you and depending on the materials

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.659 
for you and depending on the materials
you<00:00:27.390> may<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:27.749> one<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.199> than<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> other<00:00:28.669> the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
you may like one more than the other the

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.849 
you may like one more than the other the
most<00:00:29.880> important<00:00:30.419> key<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.869> note<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
most important key to note is that you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.190 
most important key to note is that you
need<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> newspaper<00:00:32.640> down<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.930> put

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
need a newspaper down if you do not put

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.630 
need a newspaper down if you do not put
your<00:00:34.320> newspaper<00:00:34.710> down<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> table<00:00:35.310> your<00:00:35.490> clay

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
your newspaper down the table your clay

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
your newspaper down the table your clay
is<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.120> stick<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.960> you'll<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
is going to stick and then you'll have a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
is going to stick and then you'll have a
big<00:00:37.590> mess<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:38.010> hands<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> you'll<00:00:38.670> end<00:00:38.850> up

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
big mess on your hands and you'll end up

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.960 
big mess on your hands and you'll end up
with<00:00:39.120> no<00:00:39.270> slab<00:00:39.920> once<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.220> your<00:00:41.520> wedge

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
with no slab once you get your wedge

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.180 
with no slab once you get your wedge
ball<00:00:42.330> clay<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> start<00:00:43.470> by<00:00:43.590> taking<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
ball clay you can start by taking it and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.600 
ball clay you can start by taking it and
turning<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.580> into<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.850> pancake<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.690> shape<00:00:46.610> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
turning it into a pancake like shape to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.050 
turning it into a pancake like shape to
do<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.060> you<00:00:48.150> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.330> do<00:00:55.700> you<00:00:56.700> start<00:00:56.970> on

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
do this all you have to do you start on

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.000 
do this all you have to do you start on
a<00:00:57.120> pancake<00:00:57.360> shape<00:00:57.810> now<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
a pancake shape now the first and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770 
a pancake shape now the first and
probably<00:00:59.310> simplest<00:00:59.790> method<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> understand

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
probably simplest method to understand

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.350 
probably simplest method to understand
is<00:01:00.960> taking<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.530> rolling<00:01:02.130> pin<00:01:02.310> which<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
is taking a rolling pin which is this

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.980 
is taking a rolling pin which is this
and<00:01:03.600> rolling<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> clay<00:01:05.450> to<00:01:06.450> flatten<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and rolling into the clay to flatten it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
and rolling into the clay to flatten it
out<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> problem<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.420> this

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
out now the problem I have with this

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.219 
out now the problem I have with this
method<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.130> roll<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.749> you<00:01:12.749> usually

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
method is as you roll this you usually

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.469 
method is as you roll this you usually
end<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.590> doing<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.130> inconsistencies<00:01:14.969> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
end up doing some inconsistencies that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.239 
end up doing some inconsistencies that
means<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.079> push<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.380> harder<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.009> one

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
means if you push down harder on one

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:19.609 
means if you push down harder on one
area<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.820> thinner<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.439> lot<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
area it's gonna be thinner a lot of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.059 
area it's gonna be thinner a lot of
times<00:01:19.909> you'll<00:01:20.909> end<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.450> only<00:01:22.380> flattening<00:01:22.979> out

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
times you'll end up only flattening out

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.669 
times you'll end up only flattening out
certain<00:01:23.460> areas<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:25.530> ways<00:01:25.649> to

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
certain areas one of the ways to

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.770 
certain areas one of the ways to
counteract<00:01:26.249> that<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.579> to<00:01:26.789> regularly<00:01:27.210> flip<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
counteract that is to regularly flip it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
counteract that is to regularly flip it
and<00:01:27.869> look<00:01:28.109> at<00:01:28.289> it<00:01:28.490> make<00:01:29.490> sure<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.909> each<00:01:30.090> area

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and look at it make sure that each area

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.349 
and look at it make sure that each area
is<00:01:30.600> getting<00:01:30.749> flattened<00:01:31.229> out<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.499> same<00:01:31.740> rate

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
is getting flattened out the same rate

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.090 
is getting flattened out the same rate
but<00:01:33.359> it<00:01:33.479> does<00:01:33.689> work<00:01:33.869> nice<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> effect<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
but it does work nice for the effect the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
but it does work nice for the effect the
report<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.999> it<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.539> very<00:01:36.780> simple<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
report and it is very very simple to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
report and it is very very simple to
understand<00:01:37.740> they're<00:01:38.219> just<00:01:38.249> rolling<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.939> out

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
understand they're just rolling it out

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.550 
understand they're just rolling it out
like<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.389> would<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.569> batch<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.139> cookie<00:01:40.530> dough

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
like you would a batch of cookie dough

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.249 
like you would a batch of cookie dough
you<00:01:41.569> end<00:01:42.569> up<00:01:43.429> your<00:01:44.429> slab<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:45.240> slab<00:01:45.780> remembers<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you end up your slab so slab remembers a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.129 
you end up your slab so slab remembers a
flat<00:01:46.590> sheet<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> clay<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> second<00:01:48.929> method

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
flat sheet of clay the second method

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.010 
flat sheet of clay the second method
which<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.249> I<00:01:50.280> use<00:01:50.639> most<00:01:50.880> often<00:01:51.119> mostly

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
which is what I use most often mostly

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.170 
which is what I use most often mostly
because<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.439> don't<00:01:52.499> have<00:01:52.709> a<00:01:52.799> real

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
because I don't have a real

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.300 
because I don't have a real
and<00:01:53.300> always<00:01:53.600> ready<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:53.930> waiting<00:01:54.290> for<00:01:54.320> me<00:01:54.620> is

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
and always ready and waiting for me is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.920 
and always ready and waiting for me is
to<00:01:55.550> take<00:01:55.730> your<00:01:55.910> clay<00:01:56.090> which<00:01:56.510> has<00:01:56.660> already<00:01:56.810> been

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
to take your clay which has already been

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.230 
to take your clay which has already been
wet<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:58.430> you're<00:01:58.580> going<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.820> take<00:01:59.570> it<00:02:01.240> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
wet and you're going to take it and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.390 
wet and you're going to take it and
you're<00:02:02.480> going<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.870> be<00:02:03.080> actually<00:02:03.440> throwing<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
you're going to be actually throwing the
