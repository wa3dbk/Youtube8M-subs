becoming much more opaque and this is

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300 
becoming much more opaque and this is
what<00:01:59.880> we're<00:02:00.090> looking<00:02:00.390> for<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.649> reason<00:02:02.159> I'm

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
what we're looking for the reason I'm

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
what we're looking for the reason I'm
doing<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.939> way<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.770> see

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
doing it this way is because you can see

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.580 
doing it this way is because you can see
the<00:02:05.310> distinct<00:02:05.880> lines<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.990> differences

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the distinct lines and differences

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.490 
the distinct lines and differences
between<00:02:08.009> each<00:02:08.489> shape<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.269> you've<00:02:09.450> made<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
between each shape that you've made and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.949 
between each shape that you've made and
this<00:02:11.069> creates<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.640> kind<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.090> wavy<00:02:12.540> ombre

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
this creates the kind of wavy ombre

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:25.520 
this creates the kind of wavy ombre
effect<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.560> we're<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:24.380> for<00:02:25.380> your
