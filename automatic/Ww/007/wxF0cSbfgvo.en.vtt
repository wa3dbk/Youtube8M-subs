00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 great fighters in the last issue we 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.600
 asked the question which towers lie outside 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.639
 premium hangar this tower 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.889
 american sherman but variations 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 Shermans in the game as much as 5 pieces it is 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.940
 complicated the task but not for us because 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.100
 thanks to the game developers we knew 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.560
 the correct answer them in advance was 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 tower with the name d 51 080 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 mounted on m4a medium tank 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 3rd 8 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.539
 only two people sent the right one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.519
 the name of the tower to our mail and we them 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 congratulations to the rest I want to wish 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 good luck next time and give advice not 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000
 hurry up with the answer because we are not in vain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.219
 we choose the most tricky questions that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 you send us 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.480
 well now let's talk about the facts 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.390
 German light tank of the second level 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.660
 panzerkampfwagen 2 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.970
 worth 3000 silver seems to be nothing 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.739
 special but if its flimsy body 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.579
 you want to pack top 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.070
 radio stations 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 then it will have to fork out because she 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 more than 7 times as expensive as the tank itself 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.170
 will cost you twenty one thousand 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.170
 six hundred coins 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.170
 ms-1 small yes remove his top engine 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.170
 170 pounds heavier than the mouse 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.580
 German light tank of the third level 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.350
 grooves 1c stands out not only for its 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.830
 top speed but also top 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.820
 the instrument 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.380
 its caliber is only 7.92 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 millimeter to compare caliber pistol 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.590
 three hundredths machine gun sword 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.590
 less millimeter 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.159
 object 430 soviet tank 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.649
 ranked tenth 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 An alternative branch of medium tanks was 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.340
 the prototype of the main battle tank of the USSR 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.959
 t-64 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 work on 430 was started in 1954 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.770
 the main task of the designers was 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.599
 development of a fundamentally new combat 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.690
 units which subsequently had to 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.099
 replace the t-54 but during the tests it became 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.959
 it is clear that a significant increase 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.759
 there were no characteristics therefore 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.459
 taking into account the remaining reserve 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.470
 modernization of the t-54 project was closed 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.420
 but this bad experience and helped create 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.879
 concept machine with fasting tea shim level 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.770
 protection of excellent maneuverability 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.330
 and powerful weapons in which became 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.670
 object 430 2 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.670
 later called t-64 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.710
 in the technical specifications of the Soviet tank 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.630
 t-28 was the clause according to which he 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.060
 should have been able to overcome the moon 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.070
 no landscapes in the 30s of the past 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.930
 century engineer not yet thought about 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.550
 space race and did not try to create 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.770
 prototype of the modern rover 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.330
 kyuriositi thing is that the moon 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.950
 landscapes called terrain 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.950
 affected by artillery strikes 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.200
 looking at some wall fences garages 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.780
 you can understand what people like to leave 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.459
 different inscriptions something can and 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.170
 worlddoftics but in this case there 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.030
 option save if you want 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.010
 decorate your favorite tank with the same 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.930
 inscriptions or emblems Komi then this is for you 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.239
 cost fifty percent cheaper 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.170
 true this rule only works with 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.170
 buying for gold 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.380
 And now let's move on to the question. 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920
 release before you trailer the french on 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.060
 approach 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.800
 which saw the light of December 20, 2011 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.630
 the question sounds like what 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.870
 a french tank was featured in this 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.890
 video but still not appeared in the game 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.720
 the correct answer will be considered 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.220
 letter sent to our mail from 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.500

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.930
 modifications all useful links will be in 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.580
 description the author of the first three songs with 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.650
 the correct answer will get 1000 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.840
 gold also increase gold reserves 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.850
