00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 who has everything but your name is good morning e 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.300
 found I am never happy and today 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 Prepare five square sheets of paper 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.660
 small like this e 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 of the glue and we can start well 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.470
 first we fold the sheet into 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.470
 diagonal for a single diagonal 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 subsequently we will fold the sheet of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.960
 new in half so we will bring this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 then he points to his opposite 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.329
 reopen the latter fold and holding 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 the triangle with the central point 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.739
 downward 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:02.930
 let's take this side and bring it to the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.930
 center and we repeat it also with this 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.610
 we take the model we turn it to the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.130
 contrary and assuring us that the parties 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 can be opened downwards 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.220
 let's take this side and bring it to the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.850
 center and when we do it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.090
 we will exit the triangle towards 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.090
 the outside 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.380
 sorry and as I said we will have to 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.630
 repeat also with this side and also 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:58.510
 on this side we will go outside 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 at the triangle we now take this 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:07.000
 this part here of sheet e 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:11.490
 we apply it to the back leaving 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.610
 leaving his twin the one behind 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:21.930
 so here we will not apply it and this 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.930
 point opening here inside 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:33.519
 we ask the sheet in half in this 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.200
 way and we'll do four more units like 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.750
 these then we should have in everything 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:44.769
 five modules and once done vi 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:51.900
 I explain how to assemble them arm yourself with 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:51.900
 glue we glue these sides 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:10.390
 we take the first side we take the other 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:11.380
 sheet and the name I call and we will do it for 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.880
 all other models 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.680
 ok let's do some speed up because 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.660
 so you don't need to look at it anyway 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.370
 passage endless times so then 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.540
 keep on continuing to bend e 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.340
 paste what you are doing there 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.560
 I say when to stop because I begin to 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.970
 talk now 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.100
 at this point we should 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.240
 then glue the last two pieces together 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.240
 also here with the oar we will open one side 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.130
 our little flower and let's touch 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:47.710
 the two ends squeeze we leave that 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:55.420
 the ball will dry and we will have ours 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:57.190
 beautiful flower of barbarism finished by 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.690
 michael bay of ideas almost everything for today 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.240
 as usual we leave each other with one 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.220
 maximum in every person there is cash 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.420
 a thin person who seems layers arts 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.420
 signals to exit 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.699
 at the edges 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.699
 come on
