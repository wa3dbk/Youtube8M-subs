00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.065
 Translation: Celentic 

00:00:01.444 --> 00:00:02.565
 EXBC! 

00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:06.504
 I will cook Powerade Ramen! 

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:10.745
 I prepared Powerade, but I drank too much. 

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:17.406
 Let's pour it into the pot! 

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:24.785
 We have cooked with Powerade. 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.729

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:34.579
 This time I will cook ramen with Powerade. 

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.426
 I will use this "golden ramen" to cook 

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:43.146
 Pour the dishes into the pan. 

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:46.594
 This is the cuisine of golden ramen! 

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:50.244
 Can this be turned into a real ramen? 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200
 It started to roll. 

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:01.588
 I am ready to put the face in. 

00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:03.227
 Ready 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.860
 are you ready? 

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:06.986
 Um~ I am ready! 

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:11.632
 Throw it in! 

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.185
 ( Soup without ramen soup powder) 

00:01:20.397 --> 00:01:21.437
 It feels weird! 

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:26.897
 Almost better! 

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:31.484
 Look at this! 

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:35.504
 Can you see this? dyeing! This color! 

00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:40.042
 Almost done! carry out! 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.850
 Look at this color! 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.060
 Why do you feel green? 

00:01:44.198 --> 00:01:47.398
 Because the face is yellow, so. . . 

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.051
 Come and try it! 

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:59.104
 What the hell is this! 

00:02:02.464 --> 00:02:03.744
 Look at this color! 

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:07.403
 Come and try it! 

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:25.220
 Give it a try! 

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:32.874
 Come to the ramen soup! 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.179
 Also known as the magic powder, can this ramen soup powder make this delicious? 

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.484
 Blended! Blended! 

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:51.858
 Visual, it looks so bad! 

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.601
 This is not the color I want! 

00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:59.601
 I have seen the same color in the repair shop today! The same as car lubricants! 

00:02:59.756 --> 00:03:00.796
 Let me give it a try! 

00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:23.784
 very sour! ! The acidity is too strong! 

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:26.424
 Ok, let's try the soup! 

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.644
 Must you swallow it? 

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.365
 The acidity is too strong! ! ! ! 

00:03:54.696 --> 00:03:55.976
 This is not a joke! 

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.127
 Really sour! 

00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:01.042
 Not the sour taste of fresh fruit! 

00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:03.765
 Can not express the strange sour taste. 

00:04:04.084 --> 00:04:04.609
 It seems like sour pickles! 

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:06.825
 Sour pickles! 

00:04:06.922 --> 00:04:08.042
 Broken kimchi! 

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:11.985
 Not sour, it is a broken kimchi! 

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:17.173
