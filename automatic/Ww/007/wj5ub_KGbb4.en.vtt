Cleveland Browns what he thought of them

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
just to take a pick a sixth round pick

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
just to take a pick a sixth round pick
and<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> fullback<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.290> then<00:00:34.680> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and a really a fullback and then we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.830 
and a really a fullback and then we
don't<00:00:35.160> even<00:00:35.309> know<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> 2012<00:00:36.570> draft

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
don't even know if there's a 2012 draft

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
don't even know if there's a 2012 draft
yet<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> conditional<00:00:37.920> pick<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.460> what

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
yet and a conditional pick I think what

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.490 
yet and a conditional pick I think what
it<00:00:38.910> shows<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.149> they're<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.899> ready<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.320> cut

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it shows is they're just ready to cut

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
it shows is they're just ready to cut
their<00:00:40.680> losses<00:00:40.860> move<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.450> try<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> go

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
their losses move on and then try to go

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.119 
their losses move on and then try to go
different<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> quarterback<00:00:43.950> position

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
different in the quarterback position

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
different in the quarterback position
they<00:00:44.489> got<00:00:44.610> no<00:00:44.789> value<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.270> Derrick<00:00:45.750> Anderson

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
they got no value for Derrick Anderson

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.540 
they got no value for Derrick Anderson
because<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> his<00:00:46.649> 10<00:00:46.829> million<00:00:47.100> dollar<00:00:47.250> salary

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
because of his 10 million dollar salary

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.840 
because of his 10 million dollar salary
he<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.510> released<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.980> trade<00:00:50.460> Quinn

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
he was released and now to trade Quinn

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.959 
he was released and now to trade Quinn
basically<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> 2011<00:00:52.920> pick<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> something

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
basically for a 2011 pick and something

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
basically for a 2011 pick and something
in<00:00:54.059> 2012<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> fullback<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
in 2012 and a fullback you can see that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.010 
in 2012 and a fullback you can see that
they<00:00:56.520> didn't<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.969> much<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.780> Brady

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
they didn't think much of what Brady

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
they didn't think much of what Brady
Quinn's<00:00:58.350> future<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.010> Cleveland<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.520> are

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
Quinn's future was in Cleveland what are

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
Quinn's future was in Cleveland what are
they<00:00:59.699> saying<00:00:59.940> why<00:01:00.359> didn't<00:01:00.989> work<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.469> for

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
they saying why didn't work out for

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.319 
they saying why didn't work out for
Brady<00:01:02.070> Quinn<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.789> Cleveland<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.239> are

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
Brady Quinn there and Cleveland what are

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
Brady Quinn there and Cleveland what are
they<00:01:03.420> saying<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.930> well<00:01:04.500> they're<00:01:04.799> not

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
they saying there well they're not

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.289 
they saying there well they're not
saying<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.090> read

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
saying but I think what you can read

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.030 
saying but I think what you can read
into<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.990> he<00:01:07.110> wasn't<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> accurate

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
into it is that he wasn't the accurate

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
into it is that he wasn't the accurate
quarterback<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:08.880> had<00:01:09.000> hoped<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.630> even

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
quarterback that they had hoped and even

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
quarterback that they had hoped and even
though<00:01:10.260> certainly<00:01:10.650> he<00:01:11.369> came<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
though certainly he came in there with a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
though certainly he came in there with a
little<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> hometown<00:01:13.290> advantage<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
little bit of a hometown advantage you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
little bit of a hometown advantage you
know<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.460> didn't<00:01:15.030> wild<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> fans<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
know he just didn't wild the fans and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.390 
know he just didn't wild the fans and
certainly<00:01:16.409> didn't<00:01:16.830> while<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> new

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
certainly didn't while the new

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
certainly didn't while the new
management<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.090> looked<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> tape

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
management when they looked at the tape

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.320 
management when they looked at the tape
and<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.979> end<00:01:20.130> accuracy<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and so in the end accuracy is so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
and so in the end accuracy is so
important<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.350> bringing<00:01:22.530> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
important and if you're bringing in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
important and if you're bringing in
somebody<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> run<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> team<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.820> Mike

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
somebody to run the team like Mike

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.730 
somebody to run the team like Mike
Holmgren<00:01:24.299> he's<00:01:24.810> gonna<00:01:24.960> look<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.259> an<00:01:25.470> accurate

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
Holmgren he's gonna look for an accurate

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
Holmgren he's gonna look for an accurate
quarterback<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> apparently<00:01:26.850> he<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.150> not

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
quarterback and apparently he did not

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
quarterback and apparently he did not
see<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.930> Brady<00:01:28.170> Quinton<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.710> you

wants value in a quarterback so I think

that<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.159> seeing<00:01:56.579> everything<00:01:56.939> being
