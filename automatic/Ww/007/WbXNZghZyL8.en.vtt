00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.349 
really did try to do the tartan but it
was<00:03:24.829> just<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.190> difficult<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.850> get<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.180> line

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
was just so difficult to get the line

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.660 
was just so difficult to get the line
straight<00:03:26.840> might<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.769> able<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
straight might be able to see but the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.420 
straight might be able to see but the
black<00:03:29.739> line<00:03:30.739> through<00:03:31.130> there<00:03:33.160> where<00:03:34.160> I've<00:03:34.250> just

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
black line through there where I've just

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.610 
black line through there where I've just
had<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.730> repaint<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.630> was<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.380> difficult

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
had to repaint it was just so difficult

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.210 
had to repaint it was just so difficult
to<00:03:37.010> get<00:03:37.190> every<00:03:38.000> line<00:03:38.470> right<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.739> just<00:03:39.920> didn't

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
to get every line right so I just didn't

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.069 
to get every line right so I just didn't
bother<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:40.910> think<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.420> looks<00:03:41.450> pretty<00:03:41.690> good

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079
