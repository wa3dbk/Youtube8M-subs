00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.060
 This video for you guys to get dressed with me 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.799
 I 'm going to a party that's carnival 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.309

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.889
 city and you will see in the game 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.850
 do hair makeup after you already 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.890
 lived in exchange let's go there I started 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:35.340
 dividing my hair into various parts 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 to be able to do the baby then I am 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.600
 doing babyliss on the underside of the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 my hair I split well 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.329

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.430
 I wanted it to be in good site boxes 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.579

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.250
 wrap him do a little finger and place 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 He will have more to play with and a teacher 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.680
 so you can take it only on time 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.010
 then I also caught roll always 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 babyliss in the case to make the bunch to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.299

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.550
 In front of me, I can do the makeup. 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.280
 quieter and I'll put a 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.350
 fixer had already put in the truth 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.270
