00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
Sony this is the pxw X 70 now it looks

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.050 
Sony this is the pxw X 70 now it looks
very<00:00:22.010> similar<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:23.510> Sony's<00:00:23.990> ax<00:00:24.529> 100<00:00:25.220> camera<00:00:25.640> but

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
very similar to Sony's ax 100 camera but

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.700 
very similar to Sony's ax 100 camera but
it's<00:00:26.210> actually<00:00:26.570> very<00:00:26.810> very<00:00:26.929> different<00:00:27.590> it

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
it's actually very very different it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.890 
it's actually very very different it
does<00:00:27.890> have<00:00:28.130> some<00:00:28.429> similarities<00:00:29.119> but<00:00:29.720> the

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
does have some similarities but the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.990 
does have some similarities but the
ergonomics<00:00:30.650> of<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:30.980> camera<00:00:31.429> are<00:00:31.609> quite

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
ergonomics of this camera are quite

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.660 
ergonomics of this camera are quite
different<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:33.110> hand<00:00:33.650> grip<00:00:33.950> here<00:00:34.220> the<00:00:34.370> whole

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
different the hand grip here the whole

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.430 
different the hand grip here the whole
shape<00:00:35.300> of<00:00:35.600> this<00:00:35.780> hand<00:00:36.050> grip<00:00:36.260> has<00:00:36.410> been

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
shape of this hand grip has been

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.950 
shape of this hand grip has been
completely<00:00:37.040> changed<00:00:37.670> over<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.000> ax<00:00:38.210> 100<00:00:38.840> and

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
completely changed over the ax 100 and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.320 
completely changed over the ax 100 and
what<00:00:39.860> that<00:00:40.010> means<00:00:40.310> is<00:00:40.520> that<00:00:40.550> when<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:40.970> hold

just<00:02:13.640> here<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:13.940> little<00:02:14.150> hard<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.570> see<00:02:14.900> there's<00:02:15.620> a

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
just here a little hard to see there's a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.839 
just here a little hard to see there's a

switch for the
nd<00:02:17.269> filters<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.989> camera<00:02:18.349> has<00:02:18.499> built-in<00:02:18.890> ND

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
nd filters so the camera has built-in ND

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.970 
nd filters so the camera has built-in ND
filters<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.689> ND<00:02:21.049> filters<00:02:21.560> allow<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:21.829> to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
filters and the ND filters allow you to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.429 
filters and the ND filters allow you to
control<00:02:22.430> your<00:02:22.700> depth<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.120> field<00:02:23.420> if<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.200> use<00:02:24.409> a

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
control your depth of field if you use a

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.000 
control your depth of field if you use a
lot<00:02:24.799> of<00:02:24.829> nd<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> large<00:02:26.599> aperture<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.829> get<00:02:27.980> a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
lot of nd with a large aperture to get a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.890 
lot of nd with a large aperture to get a
decent<00:02:28.430> exposure<00:02:28.760> you'll<00:02:29.060> have<00:02:29.209> very<00:02:29.450> shallow

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
decent exposure you'll have very shallow

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.869 
decent exposure you'll have very shallow
depth<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.439> field<00:02:30.499> and<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.400> gives<00:02:31.579> you<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> very

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
depth of field and that gives you a very

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.030 
depth of field and that gives you a very
filmic<00:02:32.420> look<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:33.290> if<00:02:33.379> you're<00:02:33.530> trying<00:02:33.769> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
filmic look but if you're trying to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.559 
filmic look but if you're trying to
shoot<00:02:34.489> something<00:02:34.700> where<00:02:34.939> you<00:02:35.030> need<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.209> lot<00:02:35.510> of

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
shoot something where you need a lot of

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.089 
shoot something where you need a lot of
depth<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.019> field<00:02:36.139> where<00:02:36.379> there's<00:02:36.590> lots<00:02:36.829> that

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
depth of field where there's lots that

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.709 
depth of field where there's lots that
you<00:02:37.219> need<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.549> focus<00:02:37.939> at<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.180> same<00:02:38.389> time

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:38.719 
you need in focus at the same time

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.339 
you need in focus at the same time
switch<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.430> ND<00:02:40.760> filters<00:02:41.299> use<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> smaller

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
switch out the ND filters use a smaller

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.020 
switch out the ND filters use a smaller
aperture<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.129> you'll<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.609> much<00:02:43.700> deeper

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
aperture and you'll have a much deeper

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.309 
aperture and you'll have a much deeper
depth<00:02:44.389> of<00:02:44.540> field<00:02:44.689> so<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.870> gives<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.079> really

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
depth of field so it gives you really

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.739 
depth of field so it gives you really
good<00:02:45.500> control<00:02:46.219> over<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> style<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.629> the

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:47.749 
good control over the style of the

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.959 
good control over the style of the
pictures<00:02:48.169> because<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.250> sensor<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:49.939> the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:49.969 
pictures because the sensor on the

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.229 
pictures because the sensor on the
camera<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.629> a<00:02:50.930> 4k<00:02:51.379> sensor<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.700> image<00:02:52.939> is<00:02:53.060> very

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
camera is a 4k sensor the image is very

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.300 
camera is a 4k sensor the image is very
very<00:02:53.540> sharp<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.560> even<00:02:54.859> when<00:02:54.980> you're<00:02:55.099> shooting

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
very sharp so even when you're shooting

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.640 
very sharp so even when you're shooting
in<00:02:55.609> HD<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.269> image<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.599> really<00:02:56.870> crisp<00:02:57.379> and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
in HD the image is really crisp and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.649 
in HD the image is really crisp and
really<00:02:57.949> clear<00:02:58.310> but<00:02:58.879> because<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.329> starting

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
really clear but because it's starting

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.890 
really clear but because it's starting
in<00:03:00.260> 4k<00:03:01.189> it<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:02.060> camera<00:03:02.389> doesn't<00:03:02.569> have<00:03:02.810> to

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
in 4k it the camera doesn't have to

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.839 
in 4k it the camera doesn't have to
apply<00:03:03.199> a<00:03:03.230> little<00:03:03.409> of<00:03:03.560> extra<00:03:03.760> enhancement<00:03:04.760> or

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
apply a little of extra enhancement or

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.280 
apply a little of extra enhancement or
other<00:03:05.000> Corrections<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.689> make<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.989> picture

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
other Corrections to make the picture

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.649 
other Corrections to make the picture
look<00:03:06.379> nice<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.829> just<00:03:06.859> simply<00:03:07.489> looks<00:03:08.090> nice<00:03:08.359> and

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
look nice it just simply looks nice and

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.659 
look nice it just simply looks nice and
that<00:03:09.109> helps<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.650> look<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.859> bit<00:03:09.889> more<00:03:10.040> film<00:03:10.459> like

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
that helps it look a bit more film like

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.399 
that helps it look a bit more film like
because<00:03:10.939> it<00:03:11.030> isn't<00:03:11.180> over<00:03:11.659> enhanced<00:03:12.169> isn't

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
because it isn't over enhanced isn't

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.789

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
record simultaneously to both cards so

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.390 
record simultaneously to both cards so
