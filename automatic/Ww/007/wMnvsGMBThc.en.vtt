 The Valencia River tributaries have been throughout the history source of wealth 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.350
 one of the most important cities was the girl 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.729
 ancient seat that in Roman times lived its greatest splendor 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.860
 Seneca changes are always controversial 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.869
 today here in alhambra that the real 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.849
 let's follow the archaeological footprints in this municipality 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.929
 to discover the city r al guadiana 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.149
 this report is sponsored by the consortium of the special high plan 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.140
 guadiana 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.400
 the waters of the Guadiana have always been a source of life 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.940
 one of the most prosperous cities was the Roman children 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.920
 ancient city enveloped in a halo of mystery since its location has been 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.150
 always an enigma 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.280
 its location we could find or the alhambra and we are in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.750
 one of the most historical places in the region 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.050
 from the city the new protect by 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.199
 all the cultures that happens in this chamber 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.090
 justly 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.710
 in those two sections of the rest of the population four thousand years ago, this is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.030
 people have had a human life continued for 4 4 thousand years that 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.070
 it is already favored that rodolfo the oldest deraa be the spear stain 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.509
 of the Lower Palaeolithic 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.020
 utensils of all kinds including dentures of more than three thousand years 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.800
 this is demonstrated 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.040
 This curious sculpture is from the time of the Iberians 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.250
 this vertigo magazine 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.690
 is going to die molins is the name of this place and because you look like 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 is a very abundant land of 7 moss kÃ¡nter asthma quarry 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.770
 e extraction this type of stone 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.150
 and that is a 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.560
 carved piece is a human feat 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.230
 for a large portion that is missing because in turn the heras bar de moe las 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:37.729
 land 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.260
 on the part of amd part of the good of this monument and it shows the claws 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.930
 the subject andÃºjar what if a person 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 They are remains that indicate the settlement of this culture in the area 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.920
 but undoubtedly those who left a more significant mark were the Romans 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.470
 and if it were not so, we would pass to the Romans, which could be the time of 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.220
 greater 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 all these pieces to be able to take the race 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.130
 the denomination by the name of the so questioned tape will remove say 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.479
 Controversy for not knowing where to locate it returns right 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.859
 let's say we can say that although the Alhambra 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.809
 with the amount of remains that have left us 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.090
 and is that the archaeological pieces that we find speak for themselves 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.559
 Anyway, he has found remains as time 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.949
 that is all 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.629
 concretely these 100 corresponds when answering 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.400
 in fall in the requests caesar percent comfortable to live this closing it 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.399
 found that in a grave of the jad 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.399
 it is fortuitous of a deposit in front of the public school 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.209
 of the next ones to the museum so that it was conserved with its description enough 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.280
 meaningful 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.709
 also curious utensils currencies coins and these two revelers togados 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.040
 that is why the Alhambra is the favorite place to locate the minimum 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:56.199
 the municipality the austral biomass of the folderna tribe and of importance since 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:00.399
 is part of the Roman road network plinio el viejo in the description of 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.659
 The cities of Roman Spain 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.439
 well 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.950
 he said that he has given truce of the population of the mini rosemont the unap 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.829
 the quarry of sandstone stones and is that they use them to affiliate that 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.529
 shuffles by Roman Empire then they arrive at the state it goes exactly the 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.939
 decision of that prize 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.760
 then it is one of the bases in at least others we say that alhambra thus 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.119
 the programmed the girl 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.119
 and is that the natural wealth of this place was key to its location 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.779
 the highlighted fact exercise of the Guadiana river in the area rich in water but the 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.709
 would be the reason why he felt that such an important city 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.349
 have important French press we believe that the jar enabled by 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.759
 true before writing 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.889
 it was the sorry field 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.499
 In this field, the goal does not come precisely at the source of the river where 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:50.239
 named then is currently located is a tributary of the Guadiana river that are 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.269
 to the good race 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.269
 water was undoubtedly a precious commodity by the ancients 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.219
 the brook alamar here they die one of the most important tributaries of guadiana 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.500
 and was born at the foot of these lands it supplied the municipality 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:10.259
 by ap ap here is born the wire stream with a gun in thousands of 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.939
 years was full of water not 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.749
 if possibly be about two thousand years ago 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:18.249
 we want everything was bogged down I want to make everyone very wet 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:19.840
 of which 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.990
 per cent the populations and petra to be a little higher 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.699
 in fact this population being completely walled 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.190
 you had a little one in country houses that I had before and Ivan villegas that 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.080
 it was located sixth along the length of the brook of apra 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.560
 that then that same roll 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.699
 just flows into the azuer river 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 a little later the agents in the beautiful swamp a prosperous corner of 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.740
 the law in the little girl light for life and not only for its natural wealth 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.129
 this attack shows that this is a defensive zone a strategic point within 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.180
 of the zone the uneasiness that demonstrates 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.340
 which is always looking for a higher place to be able to defend 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.820
 attacks of other tribes or other sites that should therefore 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.290
 welcome and stay established concretely here we are having a 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.300
 Muslim castle 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.289
 in that eighth and they entered the area 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.720
 i invaded names 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.450
 in fact the name alhambra comes from there justly 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.060
 and is that after the Muslim brothers and also visited two marked the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.100
 history the alhambra 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.700
 a historic enclave of the region and almost certainly place chosen by the 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.180
 Romans to get her child the lost city of high Guadiana 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.059
 this report has been sponsored by the consortium of the high special plan 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.319
