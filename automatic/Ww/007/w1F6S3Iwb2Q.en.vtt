everything<00:02:16.300> else<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.720> think<00:02:16.960> that<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.290> know<00:02:17.410> he

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
everything else I think that you know he

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.430 
everything else I think that you know he
fought<00:02:17.740> well<00:02:17.980> before<00:02:18.970> well<00:02:19.150> he<00:02:19.300> won<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
fought well before well he won but I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.410 
fought well before well he won but I

think that his his post-fight comments

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.870 
think that his his post-fight comments
he<00:02:22.900> should<00:02:23.170> he<00:02:23.830> shouldn't<00:02:24.190> have<00:02:24.220> he<00:02:24.580> sent<00:02:24.790> have

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
he should he shouldn't have he sent have

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
disrespectful I personally believe that

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630 
disrespectful I personally believe that
he<00:02:28.840> said<00:02:28.990> 'no<00:02:29.110> commented<00:02:29.530> after<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> fight<00:02:30.070> if
