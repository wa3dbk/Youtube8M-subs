talking<00:01:48.850> about<00:01:49.090> somebody<00:01:49.780> studying

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
talking about somebody studying

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.300 
talking about somebody studying
successful<00:01:51.940> teams<00:01:52.240> over<00:01:53.070> unsuccessful<00:01:54.070> teams

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
successful teams over unsuccessful teams

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.190 
successful teams over unsuccessful teams
and<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.700> big<00:01:54.910> indicator<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.479> performance<00:01:55.630> was

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
and a big indicator of performance was

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.640 
and a big indicator of performance was
the<00:01:56.920> ratio<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.550> positive<00:01:58.530> comments<00:01:59.530> and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
the ratio of positive comments and

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.499 
the ratio of positive comments and
feedback<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.430> negative<00:02:00.850> comments<00:02:01.360> in

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
feedback to negative comments in

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.469 
feedback to negative comments in
feedback<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.140> Yellin<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.890> screamin<00:02:03.300> would<00:02:04.300> be

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
feedback so Yellin and screamin would be

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.690 
feedback so Yellin and screamin would be
the<00:02:04.930> negative<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.160> optimum

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
the negative but I think the optimum

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180 
the negative but I think the optimum
ratio<00:02:09.880> was<00:02:10.330> like<00:02:10.570> ten<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.650> eleven<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.160> one

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
ratio was like ten to one eleven to one

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.619 
ratio was like ten to one eleven to one
twelve<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.820> one

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
twelve to one

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.910 
twelve to one
and<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.680> don't<00:02:15.739> know<00:02:16.160> many

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.620 

I<00:02:20.950> would<00:02:21.340> agree<00:02:21.520> with<00:02:21.700> John<00:02:21.880> maybe<00:02:22.150> they<00:02:22.390> say

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
I would agree with John maybe they say

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.250 
I would agree with John maybe they say
they<00:02:22.840> do<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.640> even<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.240> ask<00:02:25.420> anybody<00:02:25.930> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
they do but even if you ask anybody and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.220 
they do but even if you ask anybody and
maybe<00:02:26.620> you're<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.100> their<00:02:27.430> coach<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.230> it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
maybe you're not their coach and it's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.490 
maybe you're not their coach and it's
just<00:02:29.500> person-to-person<00:02:30.720> what<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.870> prefer

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
just person-to-person what do you prefer

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.430 
just person-to-person what do you prefer
positive<00:02:33.160> feedback<00:02:33.340> negative<00:02:33.850> feedback<00:02:34.440> it's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
positive feedback negative feedback it's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.430 
positive feedback negative feedback it's
a<00:02:35.560> no-brainer<00:02:35.710> know<00:02:36.580> anybody<00:02:36.970> they<00:02:37.690> said<00:02:37.990> no<00:02:38.410> I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
a no-brainer know anybody they said no I

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.050 
a no-brainer know anybody they said no I
want<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:39.060> go

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
want to go

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.120 
want to go
or<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.330> did<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.750> awfully<00:02:42.200> or

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
or I did it awfully or

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.040 
or I did it awfully or
I<00:02:44.160> don't<00:02:45.120> think<00:02:45.180> you're<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.660> find<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.960> lot

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
I don't think you're going to find a lot

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.610 
I don't think you're going to find a lot
of<00:02:46.110> yelling

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.420 

potentially<00:02:50.620> because<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.860> think<00:02:51.069> they<00:02:51.159> used<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
potentially because I think they used to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.860 
potentially because I think they used to
say<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.760> ratio<00:02:51.909> is<00:02:52.180> 3:1

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
say the ratio is 3:1

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.170 
say the ratio is 3:1
yeah<00:02:53.349> it's<00:02:53.590> now<00:02:53.769> yeah<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.579> fact<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:54.939> I've

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
yeah it's now yeah the fact that I've

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.910 
yeah it's now yeah the fact that I've
Oscars<00:02:55.629> but<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.930> ratio<00:02:56.230> was<00:02:56.409> yeah<00:02:56.650> when<00:02:56.860> you

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
Oscars but that ratio was yeah when you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.949 
Oscars but that ratio was yeah when you
sent<00:02:57.159> 10<00:02:57.280> 10<00:02:57.640> 11<00:02:57.760> 12<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.299> makes<00:02:58.510> sense<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.840> you

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
sent 10 10 11 12 that makes sense to you

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.500 
sent 10 10 11 12 that makes sense to you
see<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.439> I<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.920> see<00:03:00.129> that<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.549> number<00:03:01.329> is

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
see that I can see that that number is

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.129 
see that I can see that that number is
much<00:03:01.780> higher<00:03:02.019> than<00:03:02.230> most<00:03:02.409> people<00:03:02.769> expressed
