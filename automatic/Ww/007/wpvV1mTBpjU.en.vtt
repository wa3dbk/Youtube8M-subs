00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.200
 I am posting a gunpla production video. It is a gunpla team. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.820
 It is not Gunpla to introduce this time ... 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.480
 This is the Dengeki Hobby Magazine January 2015 issue. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.280
 So, the content of this magazine is 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.080
 I would like to buy a magazine and read it 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500
 I wonder why I bought this magazine, 

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.262
 This time, the appendix is ​​this. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.300
 Appeared in Gundam Build Fighters Try, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Build Burning Gundam's 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.920
 It is a head display base. 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.780
 This is attached as an appendix of this Dengeki Hobby Magazine January issue. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.480
 So before ... 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.180
 Here, 

00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:00.512
 G's Recon Gista 

00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.955
 It's G-self. It is this head display base 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.340
 This was the one for Hobby Japan, but 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.140
 It feels like this, so this time 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.220
 Build Burning Gundam's 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.500
 It is in the form of a head display base. 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.620
 So now, build burning Gundam too 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.134
 In the process of making, 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.740
 Once you're done 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.120
 I would like to use this display base to decorate. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.860
 For now, let's open this time a little 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 I would like to make it. 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 Contents, only this. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.140
 Maybe in this magazine 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.860
 I think there is a way to make this display based ... 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.354
 I will look for a little 

00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:10.553
 This time, as an article 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.360
 This Hi ガ ン ダ ム Gundam or something 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.640
 Article of Gundam Astray is quite, 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.000
 It is an article that I want to read firmly. 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.660
 Very cool ... 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.480
 And there is also an article of the unicorn Gundam of PG. 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.620
 This is already ... 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.460
 It feels like I can not wait to reach home, but ... 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.940
 It looks like this, there was a page of the assembly drawing part, 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.720
 Along this 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.840
 It is this display base. I want to make it. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.560
 This time as well as G-self head de base, 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.280
 I would like to finish with a matte spray after assembly. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.960
 Well, I've finished cutting out my hearts, so I want to assemble it. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.940
 From this time on, I say a little new weapons, 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.320
 It's another angle camera, isn't it? 

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:27.513
 Well, even though it's an iPhone, it's an camera 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.520
 It is iPhone6. Prepare that too, 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.260
 I'd like to see a little from another angle. 

00:04:25.948 --> 00:04:27.948
 I could make a part of my face, but 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.860
 It's pretty real and cool! 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.360
 It seems that even if you paint or smear this color, it looks pretty good. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.280
 The assembly of the head display base is complete. 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.700
 Because there are few parts and is big 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.680
 It can be assembled relatively easily. 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.940
 Because this gloss has a plastic unique gloss, 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.820
 From now on, I would like to apply a matte spray here. 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.920
 I just applied roughly a matte spray, 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.680
 The gloss is closed 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.880
 Personally, I finished in my favorite atmosphere. 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.340
 I also thought when I made the G-self head display base, 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.140
 When applying a matte spray to white parts, 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.100
 It looks like a plaster statue. 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.920
 As a display base, I think it became a good feeling. 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.540
 So you are the G-Self who made a little while ago, 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.180
 It looks like this. 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.200
 It is similar in size. 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.100
 I can see clearly with the naked eye, but 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.280
 The colors are slightly different. 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.100
 G-self is somewhat yellowish or greenish white, though 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.640
 Because those of build burning Gundam will be white parts 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.200
 Than··· 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.060
 It is close to the plaster statue. 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.240
 I think there are original designs, but 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.955
 If you like me 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.620
 Build Burning Gundam 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.140
 Such a part of the chest, fine Mizo, and is firmly engraved, etc 

00:07:11.393 --> 00:07:13.393
 I like it pretty much, this one. 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.020
 So, this time 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.980
 Appendix of Dengeki Hobby Magazine January 2015 issue 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.300
 Build Burning Gundam's 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.440
 It was a head display base introduction.
