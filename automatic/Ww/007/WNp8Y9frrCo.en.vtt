00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.549
 it was the year 1996 the two engineers a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.919
 industrial and the other civilian did not know nor 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.680
 it did not even cross his mind that at 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.380
 know their history and that of thousands of 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.840
 people was going to change both him and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.850
 she shared the passion and desire of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.120
 be creators and owners of their own 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.070
 destination the sports lover and she of 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.170
 independence they met in the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.999
 University of the Andes where 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.449
 they had registered to make a send 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:38.670
 there will tell your tastes your talents and 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.260
 skills in a degree thesis that does not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.329
 it just stayed on the shelves of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 university library but 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.949
 today is a company that houses daily 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 thousands of people who love the activity 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.979
 physical and I like ardi and nicol치s loaiza 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 the protagonists of this story 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.999
 they started as they do most of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.690
 entrepreneurs with a lot of desire but with 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.789
 little money in your pocket 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.699
 the corner of the seventh race with 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.770
 63rd street in the city of bogot치 was the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.140
 point chosen by the two to open a 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.330
 gym that gave them the possibility of 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.909
 live what they liked the most 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.940
 physical activity standing on this corner 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.940
 strategic day and night counted cars 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.740
 they counted people counted buses but not 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.320
 they had the money to open the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.630
 local raised their mortgage savings 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.240
 the houses of his parents and with a small 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.950
 capital started they started but to ask 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.990
 more money then what they had not 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.060
 it reached the doors of 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.819
 different banks but they did not find echo 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.649
 in its proposal was only natural the 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.750
 country was going through one of the worst 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.550
 financial crises of all time 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.560
 and surely in the minds of the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.390
 bankers did not fit a project to create 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.819
 a place to exercise without 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.250
 But someone advised them to go to the bottom 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.080
 national guarantee visit to this 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.539
 entity was practically the last 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.580
 letter that they had left and like when everything 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.890
 it's darker because it's about 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.500
 of dawn there they saw a light 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.380
 wilson eduardo su치rez background advisor 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.509
 he received it in his office I know 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.489
 and then visited the entrepreneurs in the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.770
 office of these is to say in the 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.900
 Carulla supermarket that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.640
 works in the opposite corner to what 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.090
 today is the first headquarters of your company 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 there a napkin a coffee and a donut 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.680
 they were the witnesses of the birth of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.290
 a proud and one hundred company for 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.569
 Colombian cent with the money ready and 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.250
 the increased desire contacted the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.349
 owner of the famous corner store 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.050
 but she did not believe in the project either 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.269
 like any good entrepreneur insisted 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.130
 until tired and like perseverance 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.739
 overcome what happiness does not reach 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.599
 they managed to be leased with the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.590
 expectation that parents feel 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.780
 see his son born on February 9 , 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.200
 1998 before the eyes of curious friends 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.780
 passers-by guests and some 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.989
 affiliates the first headquarters was opened 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.910
 of the medical club sports bodytech las 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.640
 more optimistic projections of the two 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.489
 engineers were to have 800 people 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.709
 in three times but to his surprise 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.870
 they had a demand of 1800 the first 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.680
 month they discovered then that there was more 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.930
 people like 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.989
 and that he loved sports look and feel 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.180
 better every day with these figures in the 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.400
 head and while everyone was still celebrating 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.079
 the opening of the chapinero nicol치s headquarters 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.950
 I was thinking about a new point for your 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.750
 deal 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.969
 equally strategic but in another 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.069
 place of the city was like that in the 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:33.379
 In 2000, the cedars headquarters opened its 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.959
 doors a year later they tried 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.719
 franchise the third venue the hill 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.549
 but this strategy did not work so 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.829
 which all bodytech venues from 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.810
 that time and to this day 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.180
 under a single model of operation 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.669
 attention and service with three locations 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.159
 bodytech had what many companies 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.019
 great would envy a board of directors 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.819
 of high level with presidents and 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.219
 directors of important companies of the 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.530
 country who gave him new points 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.540
 of view to the business and in some cases 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.159
 financial resources to continue with 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.989
 the expansion of it 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.629
 in this way they became part of 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.340
 the company partners and friends in love 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.290
 of the project and identified with the 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.090
 purpose of improving the quality of life 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.669
 of people through practice 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.590
 professional of the exercise for that 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.040
 then the city of bogota stayed 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.990
 little 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.360
 and that's why they decided to offer the 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.130
 services to other cities in the country 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.020
 fortunate were the inhabitants of the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.520
 city of Cartagena where 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.400
 built a headquarters in the sector 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.900
 tourist and residential of bocagrande 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.210
 one more venues were added 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.060
 generating a positive impact on 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.250
 cities and their inhabitants parallel to 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.380
 the openings of colombia the bet 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.190
 now it was to leave the country and conquer 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.770
 Latin America 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.350
 that's why in 2008 with the support of the fund 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.990
 of investment is made today you get to Peru 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.120
 and in 2012 thanks to the injection of 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.880
 resources of teca capital arrives in chile 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.520

 positive the bodytech dream like 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.670
 many others would not have been possible without
