00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.520
 not 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.810
 for quite a long time dancing, I realized how 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.070
 you danced you still little mother 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.080
 an individual look over the new dance 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.890
 come to the conclusion that developing your 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.980
 artistry 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.530
 you still pay attention to the basis 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.650
 which are so important to us coach I 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:45.820
 always believed that the classic is the basis of any 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:49.170
 pain artist should artist but they are good 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.900
 know the basics of your craft 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:57.340
 to achieve true freedom itself 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.739
 I donâ€™t understand everything in life often 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.150
 strive to express too much not 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.989
 possesses for this necessary 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.459
 technical base and without it your 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.680
 expressiveness limit you always 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.989
 seek free expression 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.850
 and freedom is possible only when you 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.330
 do you understand what you do 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.620
 technique 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.479
 very correct remark on you khan as 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.650
 with your vision 20 sense of dancing and 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:28.470
 gives to adjust to the demand of porn 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:31.050
 don't just argue true i'm completely 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.580
 I agree that there must be an ideal 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.550
 harmony of technique and artistry and 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.600
 sometimes it seems to me that the technique takes 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:49.770
 the top here and here it is important to find it thin 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:52.889
 balance besides how a woman is 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.660

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.770
 vision and he trusted and it is not always 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.410
