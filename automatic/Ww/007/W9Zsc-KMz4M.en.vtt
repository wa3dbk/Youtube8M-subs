zombie maps woohoo okay so since my last
update<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.590> confirmed<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.369> there

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
update I have not confirmed that there

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.189 
update I have not confirmed that there
is<00:00:17.760> definitely<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> new<00:00:18.720> gun<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
is definitely going to be a new gun the

it cooks the zombies from inside out so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
it cooks the zombies from inside out so
we'll<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.350> how<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.469> works<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
we'll see how that works out but we

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.500 
we'll see how that works out but we
don't<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.700> how<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> shoot<00:00:42.300> yet

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
but that's new gun new power gun so

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.590 
but that's new gun new power gun so
that's<00:00:44.550> awesome<00:00:44.969> glad<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
there next thing is a QED device this is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
there next thing is a QED device this is
what<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.100> can't<00:00:50.100> tell<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
what it looks like I can't tell you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
what it looks like I can't tell you
anything<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> does<00:00:51.420> because<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.960> am

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
anything about what it does because I am

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.830 
anything about what it does because I am
NOT<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> quantum<00:00:52.890> physicist<00:00:53.539> it's<00:00:54.539> something

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
NOT a quantum physicist it's something

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
NOT a quantum physicist it's something
to<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.079> quantum<00:00:55.559> physics<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.280> quantum

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to do quantum physics or quantum

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
to do quantum physics or quantum
mechanics<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.270> something<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.079> called<00:00:58.440> the

mechanics or something it's called the
quantum<00:00:58.739> entanglement<00:00:59.370> device<00:00:59.520> it's<00:01:00.090> some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
quantum entanglement device it's some

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.569 
quantum entanglement device it's some
does<00:01:00.600> something<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.620> teleportation<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.340> think

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
does something for teleportation I think

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
does something for teleportation I think
or<00:01:02.820> something<00:01:03.329> it'll<00:01:04.170> help<00:01:04.320> us<00:01:04.409> kill<00:01:04.650> zombies

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
or something it'll help us kill zombies

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
or something it'll help us kill zombies
or<00:01:05.189> help<00:01:05.400> us<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.610> away<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:05.820> them<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
or help us get away from them one of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.789 
or help us get away from them one of
those<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:06.810> it'll<00:01:07.110> definitely<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> can

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
those things it'll definitely do I can

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
those things it'll definitely do I can
promise<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> QED<00:01:09.299> we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
promise you that so that's the QED we

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
promise you that so that's the QED we
also<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.530> couple<00:01:10.830> new<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.610> know

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
also know some couple new things we know

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.710 
also know some couple new things we know
that<00:01:11.939> there's<00:01:12.090> definitely<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that there's definitely going to be a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
that there's definitely going to be a
new<00:01:12.869> perk<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.380> didn't<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
new perk I didn't know about that in the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.920 
new perk I didn't know about that in the
last<00:01:14.520> episode<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> last<00:01:15.390> video<00:01:15.689> but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
last episode or the last video but

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570 
last episode or the last video but
there's<00:01:16.470> definitely<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.799> new<00:01:16.890> perk<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.400> sure

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
there's definitely a new perk not sure

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.980 
there's definitely a new perk not sure
what<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.850> yet<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.240> no<00:01:18.420> idea<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:18.869> it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
what it is yet have no idea what it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080 
what it is yet have no idea what it's
about<00:01:19.049> about<00:01:20.009> definitely<00:01:20.400> new<00:01:20.490> /<00:01:20.670> coming

which is great I love that there's going

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.039 
which is great I love that there's going
to<00:01:23.130> eight<00:01:23.310> perks<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:23.820> hopefully<00:01:24.479> consistent

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to eight perks now hopefully consistent

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
to eight perks now hopefully consistent
as<00:01:25.640> considering<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:26.729> bring<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> last

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
as considering they bring in the last
