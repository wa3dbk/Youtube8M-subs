00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.950
 hi girls how are you good as you see 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.360
 I have changed my look leaving in 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.309
 comments you like it or not I the truth 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.650
 I see a little weird but hey need 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.910
 a change and if my networks tell me 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.559
 I suppose you have already seen it 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.029
 because I already uploaded it if you do not follow me 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.400
 I'll leave them down here for us 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.589
 let's see every day very well and in the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.560
 Today's video I'm very happy because 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.509
 I wanted to route the channel through a site 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.279
 why I think he was not on track 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.699
 now because I had already focused 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.070
 too much in the comments 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.260
 tags to talk to you and I already wanted to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.850
 You can help a little and good as 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.110
 I know I'm not a professional and that I do not 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.960
 I want to put here show you how to do 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 a batman or a triple pirouette because no 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.420
 I know how to do it myself because I wanted to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.250
 start from the basics so I'm going 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.750
 to go little by little at the same time that I 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.310
 I'm learning, I want us to go 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.200
 learning all together because I 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.750
 it seems an incongruence to start 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.970
 directly with the rockets when I think 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.800
 that there are many girls that maybe 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.690
 can not go to class that maybe is in 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.460
 house and they want to do something easy that 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.290
 they will not hurt themselves by doing it and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.360
 that is the most basic of the ballet so 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.280
 in today's video I 'm going to teach you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.350
 some of the exercises that I do in 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.120
 bar to heat or go explaining everything 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.130
 as clear as I can and then in those 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.740
 Exercises ofra positions I will speak 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 of the positions in my body as I 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.970
 affect how I can get to them the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.890
 opening that I have since being frank and 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.510
 some warm-up exercises that 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.910
 I hope you serve much the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.370
 put in practice and many kisses 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.350
 very much love as always and see you 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.210
 here on Friday that comes with a video 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.200
 tips I'm looking forward already 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.630
 do what 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.490
 many little kisses thank you very much 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.409
 everyone 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.070
 good guys and let's start with the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.770
 positions will be something very simple where 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.750
 we will mark first position and slowly 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.020
 we will go to the 1st 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.690
 the important part of this part is to go slow 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.120
 forcing positions and 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.520
 keeping the position very well we will do 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.170
 the same in the second position and as 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.960
 I said the most fundamental thing here is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.380
 go down slowly but exercising 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.450
 although it does not seem the same in fourth 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.340
 getting abdominal and not letting the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 knees are we going to be the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.230
 absolute trend in fourth 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
 position and the same in fifth or in my 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.209
 case third position 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.489
 and now we repeat the same but 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.620
 double speed and we can accompany it 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.690
 with arm x the same in second 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.360
 position 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.180
 in fourth position watching the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
 knees and finally in third 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.360
 position 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.160
 let's know vices to force the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 instep and I like to make them two in 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.810
 two 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.850
 clearly forcing what is the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.520
 instep but above all without making us 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.620
 damage without forcing to the extreme where 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.440
 you can not anymore and it hurts you always arrived 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.140
 the limit of pain without exceeding it and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 we will repeat it twice on each side in 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.310
 eight times 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.890
 and we will end with a great click 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.630
 and the same in second and fourth position 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.240
 fifth but I here as an example os 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 I show the second position force well 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.980
 the instep and finish in the broad and huh 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.310
 now we go with the lady is that I 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:39.989
 I usually do on the fence before I start 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:46.480
 and the relief style has click stretched and 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:48.540
 Stretched foot style explains lb and lb is going 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.599
 little by little 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.610
 and then we force the instep again and 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.890
 the metatarsal 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.850
 that's very good to do it before 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.250
 start the class to not be so 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.210
 we can also make the wide relief 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.750
 in first position and repeat it in all 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.750
 the positions 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.020
 cut the instep girls well 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.580
 the presentation is the background and we usually 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.300
 mark with spades, biting well with the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.960
 instep and watching from bottom to pique 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.120
 world to pique irlo varying but over 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.680
 all go dragging well on the ground 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.760
 that I think is what most 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.760
 characterizes the background 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.680
 finally a few batman do is 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.490
 very important to maintain the posture 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.139
 and as you can see, it had started a bit bad 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.840
 balanced and I've put myself in first 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.300
 position and keep the shaft very well and not 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.729
 let's say lean on one leg is very 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.070
 important here re-recorded ahead and 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.380
 from behind for you to see it the best is 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.030
 that you are totally aligned 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.670
 It's already here, guys, I hope you have 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.820
 served a lot and as always very much 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.820
 love
