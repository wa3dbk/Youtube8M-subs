at<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.900> time<00:02:07.050> there<00:02:07.500> was<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> lot<00:02:08.100> of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
at that time there was a lot of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.560 
at that time there was a lot of
confusion<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.250> drugs<00:02:11.610> could<00:02:12.240> do

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
confusion about what the drugs could do

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.980 
confusion about what the drugs could do
what<00:02:12.959> they<00:02:13.110> would<00:02:13.350> do<00:02:13.620> they<00:02:14.690> made<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.840> very

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
what they would do they made you very

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.130 
what they would do they made you very
sick<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.459> was<00:02:17.610> easy<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.940> stay<00:02:18.240> away<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.810> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
sick so it was easy to stay away and I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.110 
sick so it was easy to stay away and I
think<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.770> if<00:02:20.489> you're<00:02:20.700> looking<00:02:21.030> at

think and if you're looking at

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.580 
think and if you're looking at
short-term<00:02:22.489> options<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:24.270> know<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:24.720> Ryan<00:02:25.320> were

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
short-term options you know if Ryan were

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.479 
short-term options you know if Ryan were
to<00:02:25.770> go<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.430> party<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.340> on<00:02:29.459> a

to go out and party you know or go on a

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.120 
to go out and party you know or go on a
bender<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> weekend<00:02:30.630> she<00:02:31.350> probably<00:02:31.620> felt

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
bender for the weekend she probably felt

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.920 
bender for the weekend she probably felt
much<00:02:32.340> better<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> midst<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.570> then

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
much better in the midst of that then

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.080 
much better in the midst of that then
she<00:02:34.110> did<00:02:34.290> sitting<00:02:34.739> at<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> hospital<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
she did sitting at the hospital with a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.420 
she did sitting at the hospital with a
bunch<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.420> other<00:02:36.600> sick<00:02:36.930> people<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.770> having<00:02:38.220> to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
bunch of other sick people and having to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.380 
bunch of other sick people and having to
take<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.790> atrocious<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.739> time<00:02:41.390> tasting

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
take this atrocious at that time tasting

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.420 
take this atrocious at that time tasting
a<00:02:43.430> drug<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.640> made<00:02:44.850> her<00:02:45.090> feel<00:02:45.780> even<00:02:46.080> sicker<00:02:46.430> in

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
a drug that made her feel even sicker in

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.820 
a drug that made her feel even sicker in
the<00:02:47.640> short<00:02:47.910> term<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.230> easy<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> stay

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the short term so it was easy to stay

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.680 
the short term so it was easy to stay
away<00:02:50.100> from<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> think<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.600> a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
away from that and I think you know a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
away from that and I think you know a
lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> people<00:02:52.019> did<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:53.040> similar<00:02:53.489> with

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
lot of people did it's it's similar with

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.940 
lot of people did it's it's similar with
chemotherapy<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:55.380> had<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:55.799> been<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
chemotherapy this had to have been a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.150 
chemotherapy this had to have been a
long<00:02:56.190> process<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.790> feel<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:58.160> had

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
long process to feel like you really had

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
long process to feel like you really had
become<00:02:59.549> her<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.390> would<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.690> know<00:03:00.840> what

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
become her and I would like to know what

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.530 
become her and I would like to know what
came<00:03:01.350> first<00:03:01.380> was<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> voice<00:03:02.489> was<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
came first was it the voice was it the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.590 
came first was it the voice was it the
mannerisms<00:03:04.170> was<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.830> everything<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.360> piece

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
mannerisms was it everything of a piece

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.470 
mannerisms was it everything of a piece
together<00:03:07.160> what's<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.760> building<00:03:09.209> a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
together what's it's like building a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.039 
together what's it's like building a
puzzle<00:03:09.690> right<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:12.269> have<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> lead

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
puzzle right you you you you have a lead

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.570 
puzzle right you you you you have a lead
you<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.620> something<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.190> fits<00:03:14.370> together

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
you have something that fits together

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.580 
you have something that fits together
you<00:03:15.150> work<00:03:15.360> over<00:03:15.540> here<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.079> work<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.410> another

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
you work over here you work on another

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.759 
you work over here you work on another
side<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.250> eventually<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.030> comes<00:03:18.360> together

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
side and eventually it comes together

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.819 
side and eventually it comes together
and<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.700> picture<00:03:21.829> sometimes

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
and you can see the picture sometimes

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.979 
and you can see the picture sometimes
you<00:03:23.220> know<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.400> don't<00:03:23.640> finish<00:03:23.880> until<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.780> very

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
you know you don't finish until the very

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.220 
you know you don't finish until the very
end<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.910> can't<00:03:27.150> find<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.510> solutions<00:03:27.959> do<00:03:28.200> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
end you can't find the solutions do you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.160 
end you can't find the solutions do you
solve<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.680> problem<00:03:28.709> over<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.959> learn

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
solve a problem over here and you learn

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.699 
solve a problem over here and you learn
something<00:03:31.530> about<00:03:31.799> how<00:03:32.130> things<00:03:32.370> fit<00:03:32.640> together

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
something about how things fit together

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.440 
something about how things fit together
but<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:35.430> know<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.579> think<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.420> in

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
