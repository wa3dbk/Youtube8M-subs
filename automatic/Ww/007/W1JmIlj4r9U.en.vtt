00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.300 

I<00:00:03.600> mean<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.590> thought<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:04.830> was<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> come

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
I mean I thought it was going to come

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.219 
I mean I thought it was going to come
but<00:00:05.490> anyway<00:00:05.910> let's<00:00:06.090> get<00:00:06.180> into<00:00:06.359> round<00:00:06.450> 3<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:07.229 
but anyway let's get into round 3 and

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:09.410 
but anyway let's get into round 3 and
let's<00:00:07.950> see<00:00:08.100> if<00:00:08.160> complexity<00:00:08.820> can<00:00:09.059> turn<00:00:09.240> this

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
let's see if complexity can turn this

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.760 
let's see if complexity can turn this
around<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.930> going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.200> be<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.350> a<00:00:10.469> grand

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
around it is going to be in a grand

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.299 
around it is going to be in a grand
arena<00:00:11.129> I've<00:00:11.610> got<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> feeling<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:13.309> might

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
arena I've got a feeling that this might

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.220 
arena I've got a feeling that this might
go<00:00:14.429> slightly<00:00:14.700> benefi<00:00:15.269> complexity<00:00:15.900> I'm<00:00:16.020> sure

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
go slightly benefi complexity I'm sure

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.470 
go slightly benefi complexity I'm sure
they<00:00:16.349> should<00:00:16.560> be<00:00:16.650> learning<00:00:16.830> from<00:00:17.330> would<00:00:18.330> say

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
they should be learning from would say

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.450 
they should be learning from would say
mistakes<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.200> just<00:00:19.349> maybe<00:00:19.619> learning<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.279> wait

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
mistakes or just maybe learning how wait

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.810 
mistakes or just maybe learning how wait
show<00:00:20.700> and<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.029> playing<00:00:21.329> but<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.500> oldest<00:00:23.130> just

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
show and are playing but the oldest just

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.190 
show and are playing but the oldest just
didn't<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.180> too<00:00:24.239> well<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.169> and

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
didn't go too well for them you know and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.220 
didn't go too well for them you know and
that<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> result<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.180> superb<00:00:27.960> play

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
that was a result of the superb play

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.190 
that was a result of the superb play
from<00:00:28.559> DK<00:00:29.399> or<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.669> the<00:00:29.759> last<00:00:30.000> game<00:00:30.270> but<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.079> know

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
from DK or in the last game but you know

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.380 
from DK or in the last game but you know
I<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.739> feeling<00:00:32.070> complexity<00:00:32.700> look<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.090> lot

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I get the feeling complexity look a lot

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
I get the feeling complexity look a lot
more<00:00:33.450> coordinate<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.500> running<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.070> setup

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
more coordinate is running this setup

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
more coordinate is running this setup
it's<00:00:35.670> definitely<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.180> setup<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.660> enjoy

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's definitely just setup they enjoy

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
it's definitely just setup they enjoy

the<00:00:39.210> most<00:00:39.390> fun<00:00:39.720> with<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.740> really<00:00:40.980> shows

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
the most fun with and it really shows
