00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
would be the new player of the year

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
would be the new player of the year
award<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.140> Young<00:01:04.350> Player<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> Year

award or the Young Player of the Year

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
award or the Young Player of the Year
kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.420> different

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
kind of but a little bit different

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.359 
kind of but a little bit different
rookies<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.170> their<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:07.560> season<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.220> the

rookies it's their first season in the
league<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:09.930> guess<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> newcomer<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040

the actual name of that's called but

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.870 
the actual name of that's called but
that<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.880> 2004<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.369> 2006<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> end

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that was in 2004 now in 2006 at the end

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.429 
that was in 2004 now in 2006 at the end
of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> year<00:01:18.390> full<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> putting<00:01:19.080> an<00:01:19.170> offer

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
of the year full and putting an offer

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
of the year full and putting an offer
for<00:01:19.770> him<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.070> four<00:01:20.430> million<00:01:20.939> u.s.<00:01:21.420> dollars

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
for him for four million u.s. dollars

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
for him for four million u.s. dollars
which<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.479> biggest<00:01:24.479> total<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> time

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
which was the biggest total at the time

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.080 
which was the biggest total at the time
and<00:01:27.200> that's<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.700> over

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and that's I think that was just over

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
and that's I think that was just over
about<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.659> million<00:01:30.930> pounds<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.590> uh<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
about two million pounds then uh and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
about two million pounds then uh and
then<00:01:32.640> obviously<00:01:33.000> he<00:01:33.299> went<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.990> some

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
then obviously he went on to do some

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
then obviously he went on to do some
great<00:01:34.650> things<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.159> Fulham<00:01:35.490> enjoying

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
great things with Fulham enjoying

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
great things with Fulham enjoying
Tottenham<00:01:36.750> last<00:01:37.079> year<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> now<00:01:37.560> he<00:01:37.860> has

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Tottenham last year and now he has

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.050

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
the mls season is probably I'd say about

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.309 
the mls season is probably I'd say about
halfway<00:04:07.949> maybe<00:04:08.699> a<00:04:08.790> little<00:04:09.359> bit<00:04:09.900> more<00:04:10.079> than

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
more than halfway over at this point and

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.689 
more than halfway over at this point and
