00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
hopefully the very least we do

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.010 
hopefully the very least we do
synchronize<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.640> Tim<00:05:25.820> in<00:05:25.970> nature<00:05:26.240> which<00:05:26.840> we

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
synchronize the Tim in nature which we

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.970 
synchronize the Tim in nature which we
kind<00:05:27.140> of<00:05:27.260> cool<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.500> because<00:05:27.740> that's<00:05:27.800> what

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
kind of cool it because that's what

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.690 
kind of cool it because that's what
we're<00:05:28.100> going<00:05:28.250> for

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
we're going for

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.210 
we're going for

was<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:32.780> saying<00:05:33.050> but<00:05:33.890> oh<00:05:34.100> it's<00:05:34.250> actually

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
was just saying but oh it's actually

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.700 
was just saying but oh it's actually
gonna<00:05:34.580> be<00:05:34.730> in<00:05:34.880> this<00:05:35.060> box<00:05:35.330> right<00:05:35.660> all<00:05:36.560> right

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
gonna be in this box right all right

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.030 
gonna be in this box right all right
impish<00:05:37.100> nature<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:37.760> that's<00:05:37.850> run<00:05:38.830> not<00:05:39.830> that

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
impish nature so that's run not that

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.560 
impish nature so that's run not that
good<00:05:40.220> it's<00:05:40.700> actually<00:05:41.000> probably<00:05:41.180> one<00:05:41.420> of<00:05:41.480> the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
good it's actually probably one of the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.420 
good it's actually probably one of the
worst<00:05:41.720> nature's<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.260> could<00:05:42.410> have<00:05:42.500> had<00:05:42.650> it's

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
worst nature's it could have had it's

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.500 
worst nature's it could have had it's
probably<00:05:43.700> not<00:05:43.790> even<00:05:43.850> worth<00:05:43.970> checking<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
probably not even worth checking the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.570 
probably not even worth checking the
IV's<00:05:44.720> at<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.020> point<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:45.470> but<00:05:46.310> either<00:05:46.400> way

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
IV's at this point so but either way

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.730 
IV's at this point so but either way
it's<00:05:46.820> still<00:05:47.030> a<00:05:47.090> really<00:05:47.630> cool<00:05:47.660> shiny<00:05:48.410> and<00:05:48.680> we

it's still a really cool shiny and we

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.260 
it's still a really cool shiny and we
can<00:05:48.890> just<00:05:49.040> drop<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.820> our<00:05:50.000> nice<00:05:50.120> little
