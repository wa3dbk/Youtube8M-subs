00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.460
 This video is presented by mm Google Year 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.950
 GM is injured 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.789
 MOPO GR offers you both Oh and Gold 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.120
 Sidiqi 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.509
 Klinkrad and much more 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.350
 therefore 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.940
 Amaru GR also arrived at the end with the 6 which is one of ten cases 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.370
 around her house &amp; living 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.060
 almost peacefully through the signal boxes what is not here anymore 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.740
 Returning on the way forward will emigrate, he is now complaining 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 Arcor order, but you have to say that the fight still not so 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.120
 Very much familiar with the old boss as in a fight 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.490
 You know but the Tropper percent of buses 1 to 4 are on violence 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.929
 next to be lung 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.929
 Euro last year 2 and right was allowed for Regensburg 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.790
 and percent indoor in Athens away, the fight stood in the East phase percent 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.620
 each intervened by Prince Ferfried 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.080
 in this Baur progression, the battle still consists of three phases 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.579
 once summed up for the First Grader 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.610
 and then two random phases here as it looks like here the guys get phase 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.500
 Since he turns into a prince can still in KleinmÃ¼nster ball that is 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 a very very sensitive intensive phase 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.600
 The poor really demand a lot because in between percent per 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 One-penny percent of animals is something that we, for example, reinforce through me 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.310
 also and I said Barth of the dates before says therefore it is not 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 to be able to do a lot of damage in the Moods final fight 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920
 Percent more, it looks dark 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.250
 and suddenly there are threats around 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.470
 and yes that's not exactly percent "very very scared" water here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.490
 makes and percent simple life healing intensive 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.530
 the corridors and the whole draws then until 10 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.170
 until 12 will finish here with the Dragon high phase in our case 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 how does the product always see me through the last phase through it? 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.969
 obviously also glad soon he wants to be sure 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.210
 may also be that he still always concludes with the Brain high phase and 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.800
 the episode phase just 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.400
 Bremen is percent based on not so easy course, must 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.900
 from the outside fire department we just run from the painter Breno sick Bente Kraus 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.300
 then there are these fire columns laws for example percent that stands ours 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.020
 Dekra 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.540
 near Sona pillar of fire and even now has long been in one 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.740
 Fire column of the front 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.980
 Of that you have to walk away because percent if you stay there Krischmann 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.540
 While it is true Haller is serving testing so stand 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.249
 remained that died of it 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.509
 Hoff and I paid attention and year but we still managed to 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.170
 nearly Five Year conciliatory so deep with their animals as well 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.680
 a gen challengers we graduated with and both come along 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.569
 Doors look and you can give up various quests as well, by the way 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.840
 There are pockets and quite a few other things as well 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.350
 can i recommend the lucky one another two percent another but couples 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.190
 For one thing, we have the tee off here at Moss, it's like that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.769
 Percent before 4 o'clock stormed around six weeks so should the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.120
 Percent fly around only so there had to be fully pushed and run away 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.150
 and on the morning, however, that does not really give the percent 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.370
 sure a noteworthy special challenge thus offers in principle 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.299
 it's so 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.510
 that the vines has the initial phase after the killer Karat with his ten down 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.450
 comes and see at 8 percent 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.620
 we'll pick one of this party next to the case it was pointless 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.569
 took 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.929
 In addition to very much damage is the BA to it above all, however, too 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:39.169
 no harm but he is boring and not worthy of mention 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.089
 Maybe he's going to rampage in the room, I'll say 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:48.419
 and percent in the eagle just the hurricanes that fly so through the 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.799
 You should not get caught on it 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.140
 but that is so high one of the important things and needs to come as well 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.040
 Credit percent you have to destroy so 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.709
 Potsdam and hurricanes dodge respectively death and 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.629
 destroy and percent yes and of course the urge to murder is definitely one 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.770
 heal intensive percentage that beekeepers and the mixed state sure 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.109
 if he still the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.720
 the final version of the percent he sits here 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.390
 one of those flames road he makes out of the us economy before 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.110
 go out and then just those columns of flame East and in between 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.380
 from time to time 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.720
 Spahn the job market there is something to me 4060 mourning is due to extremely much 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.630
 Damage that comes around is not too close to fire, it should look like it's out 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.090
 yes sometimes left in the picture 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.580
 The Paladin of the World is of course of course 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.470
 Percent of the surfers attacked and also in the summer Sollstedt but we 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.559
 still did it 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:52.139
 yes, that percent of the hottest even failed as poor as already 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.749
 If you know all the overview you will find a link on your account as well 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.440
 in the video description 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.470
 and if challenged they'll just over sooner or later 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.279
 the courage 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.789
 still incorporate so that she has an important base what to dry 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:07.980
 which post 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.069
 so that you know that he is also important the quests percent 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.050
 are not uninteresting for self-defense I said thank you 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.999
 to watch until first turn this year
