Google<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:38.070> does<00:03:38.310> mean<00:03:38.550> if<00:03:38.850> they've<00:03:39.060> got

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
Google but it does mean if they've got

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.210 
Google but it does mean if they've got
minus<00:03:39.480> 10<00:03:39.750> they're<00:03:39.960> very<00:03:40.380> likely<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.740> become<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
world-class player basically I'm

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.520 
world-class player basically I'm
reputation<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.400> believe<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:45.330> -<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.380> might

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
reputation I believe is that - it might

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.430 
reputation I believe is that - it might
be<00:03:46.650> out<00:03:46.770> yeah<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.340> out<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.640> hundreds<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.090> us

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
be out yeah it's out to hundreds of us

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.430 
be out yeah it's out to hundreds of us
how<00:03:50.450> highly<00:03:51.450> regarded<00:03:51.600> there<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.380> they

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
how highly regarded there and they

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.990 
how highly regarded there and they
country<00:03:52.740> how<00:03:52.860> famous<00:03:53.100> they<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.460> basically

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
country how famous they are basically

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.540 
country how famous they are basically
then<00:03:54.270> hate<00:03:54.480> height<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.140> weight<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.740> think

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
then hate height and weight I think

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.730 
then hate height and weight I think
Heights<00:03:56.760> out<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.090> about<00:03:57.240> 208<00:03:58.230> which<00:03:58.530> is

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
Heights out of about 208 which is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.120 
Heights out of about 208 which is

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
centimeters and weights kilograms

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
centimeters and weights kilograms
probably<00:04:02.130> about<00:04:02.220> 90<00:04:02.760> or<00:04:02.790> something<00:04:03.150> left<00:04:03.810> foot

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
probably about 90 or something left foot

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.880

south<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.460> 20<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.420> how<00:04:06.600> good<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.080> are<00:04:07.110> right

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
south of 20 so how good they are right

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.810

don't<00:04:12.540> really<00:04:12.780> need<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.470> worry<00:04:13.590> about<00:04:13.920> it

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
don't really need to worry about it

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.500 
don't really need to worry about it
should<00:04:14.280> sort<00:04:14.460> itself<00:04:14.790> out<00:04:15.000> if<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.210> just<00:04:15.360> leave

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
should sort itself out if you just leave

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.960 
should sort itself out if you just leave
that<00:04:15.660> blank<00:04:15.830> positions<00:04:16.830> also<00:04:17.070> after<00:04:17.400> 20<00:04:17.790> so

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
that blank positions also after 20 so

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.539 
that blank positions also after 20 so
you<00:04:18.000> can<00:04:18.210> say<00:04:18.450> he<00:04:19.320> could<00:04:19.500> give<00:04:19.650> them<00:04:19.859> multiple

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
you can say he could give them multiple

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.760 
you can say he could give them multiple
positions<00:04:21.000> if<00:04:21.180> he<00:04:21.299> wants<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.840> everything

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
positions if he wants it and everything

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.120 
positions if he wants it and everything
else<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.070> out<00:04:23.190> 220<00:04:23.669> as<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:23.940> know<00:04:24.090> on<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.510> game

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
else is out 220 as you know on the game

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.450 
else is out 220 as you know on the game

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
have given them out of 20 so it won't

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.480 
have given them out of 20 so it won't
give<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.810> really<00:04:38.139> obscure<00:04:38.650> things<00:04:39.069> that

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
give you and really obscure things that

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
aren't suited to their position it might

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.610 
aren't suited to their position it might
do<00:04:41.319> but<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.680> should<00:04:41.860> be<00:04:42.460> sensible<00:04:43.289> but<00:04:44.289> like<00:04:44.440> I

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
do but it should be sensible but like I

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.010 
do but it should be sensible but like I
said<00:04:44.699> you've<00:04:45.699> got<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:45.970> potential<00:04:46.270> figure<00:04:46.900> out

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
said you've got the potential figure out

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.100 
said you've got the potential figure out
of<00:04:47.139> 200<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:47.889> if<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:48.729> do<00:04:49.000> put<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.419> hunt<00:04:49.599> when<00:04:49.990> T

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
of 200 so if you do put to hunt when T

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.110 
of 200 so if you do put to hunt when T
on<00:04:50.440> everything<00:04:50.889> they<00:04:51.069> won't<00:04:51.370> be<00:04:51.520> twenty<00:04:51.940> at

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
on everything they won't be twenty at

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.850 
on everything they won't be twenty at
the<00:04:52.240> start<00:04:52.539> that's<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.080> potential<00:04:53.440> they<00:04:53.710> can

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
the start that's the potential they can

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.230 
the start that's the potential they can
possibly<00:04:54.069> get<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.490> if<00:04:54.699> they're<00:04:54.849> trained<00:04:55.090> up

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
possibly get to if they're trained up

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.960 
possibly get to if they're trained up
correctly<00:04:55.599> if<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.050> play<00:04:56.289> them<00:04:56.669> etc<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.849> all

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
correctly if you play them etc and all

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.580 
correctly if you play them etc and all
the<00:04:58.150> other<00:04:58.360> possibilities<00:04:59.020> in<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.259> game<00:04:59.410> so

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
the other possibilities in the game so

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.080 
the other possibilities in the game so
it<00:04:59.680> doesn't<00:04:59.710> guarantee<00:05:00.220> they're<00:05:00.729> going<00:05:00.880> to

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
it doesn't guarantee they're going to

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.180 
it doesn't guarantee they're going to
reach<00:05:01.300> twenty<00:05:01.810> or<00:05:01.990> have<00:05:02.199> twenty<00:05:02.680> at<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.919> start

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
reach twenty or have twenty at the start

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.730 
reach twenty or have twenty at the start
so<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.449> do<00:05:04.599> that<00:05:04.720> for<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.020> mental

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
so you just do that for the mental

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.409 
so you just do that for the mental
physical<00:05:05.949> and<00:05:06.370> technocrat<00:05:07.000> treats<00:05:07.240> and

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
physical and technocrat treats and

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.510 
physical and technocrat treats and
goalkeeping<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:08.020> well<00:05:08.229> preferred<00:05:08.860> moves<00:05:09.160> you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
goalkeeping as well preferred moves you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.370 
goalkeeping as well preferred moves you
can<00:05:09.669> select<00:05:09.880> things<00:05:10.210> like<00:05:10.539> they<00:05:10.810> try<00:05:11.320> the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
can select things like they try the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.260 
can select things like they try the
killer<00:05:11.650> ball<00:05:11.860> often<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:12.880> there's<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.120> whole

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
killer ball often so there's a whole

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.320 
killer ball often so there's a whole
list<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.780> that's<00:05:14.650> basically<00:05:15.250> how<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.789> create

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
list and that's basically how you create

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.240 
list and that's basically how you create
a<00:05:16.360> player<00:05:16.660> so<00:05:16.930> once<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.229> created<00:05:17.530> a<00:05:17.650> player<00:05:17.860> or

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
a player so once you created a player or

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.499 
a player so once you created a player or
players<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:19.120> put<00:05:19.690> them<00:05:19.810> in<00:05:19.900> teams<00:05:20.669> then<00:05:21.669> you
