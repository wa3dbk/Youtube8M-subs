so<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.310> adhere<00:02:06.270> everything<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.409> gonna

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so to adhere everything I'm just gonna

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.130 
so to adhere everything I'm just gonna
use<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.860> tombow<00:02:08.310> mono<00:02:08.789> multi<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:09.989> when

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
use my tombow mono multi so then when

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.850 
use my tombow mono multi so then when
you're<00:02:10.259> using

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you're using

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.540 
you're using
really<00:02:11.780> detailed<00:02:12.780> small<00:02:13.590> die-cuts<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.340> this

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
really detailed small die-cuts like this

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.760 
really detailed small die-cuts like this
I<00:02:14.790> know<00:02:15.390> some<00:02:15.570> people<00:02:15.750> use<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> Zion<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.620> another

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I know some people use a Zion or another

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.320 
I know some people use a Zion or another
little<00:02:16.980> machine<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.340> run<00:02:17.550> their<00:02:18.000> die-cut

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
little machine to run their die-cut

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
little machine to run their die-cut
through<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.840> puts<00:02:19.020> all<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> adhesive<00:02:19.620> I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
through and it puts all the adhesive I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
through and it puts all the adhesive I
have<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> those<00:02:21.090> somewhere<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.780> again

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
have one of those somewhere but again

don't have to cover the whole thing one
that<00:02:35.790> takes<00:02:36.030> way<00:02:36.270> too<00:02:36.300> long<00:02:36.480> too<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.140> uses<00:02:37.410> too

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
that takes way too long too it uses too

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.480 
that takes way too long too it uses too
much<00:02:37.740> glue<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.440> three<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.280> gonna<00:02:41.400> end

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
much glue and three it's just gonna end

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.950 
much glue and three it's just gonna end
up<00:02:41.610> making<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.000> mess<00:02:42.240> when<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.540> actually<00:02:42.690> go<00:02:42.900> to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
up making a mess when you actually go to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.420 
up making a mess when you actually go to
press<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.380> down<00:02:43.410> onto<00:02:43.710> your<00:02:43.830> card<00:02:44.130> you're<00:02:44.310> just

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
press it down onto your card you're just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.950 
press it down onto your card you're just
gonna<00:02:44.520> glue<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.090> oozing<00:02:45.300> out<00:02:45.450> everywhere<00:02:45.840> so

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
gonna glue like oozing out everywhere so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.270 
gonna glue like oozing out everywhere so
yeah<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.860> little<00:02:47.400> tiny<00:02:47.670> dots<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.920> know<00:02:50.040> so

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
yeah just little tiny dots you know so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.030 
yeah just little tiny dots you know so
that<00:02:50.430> each<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> area<00:02:51.560> has<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> dot<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.010> glue

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that each kind of area has a dot of glue

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.560 
that each kind of area has a dot of glue
is<00:02:53.490> more<00:02:54.390> than<00:02:54.510> enough<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.990> my<00:02:55.170> opinion<00:02:56.570> like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
is more than enough in my opinion like

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.170 
is more than enough in my opinion like
and<00:02:57.900> again<00:02:58.320> keep<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> dots<00:02:58.860> tiny<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.730> you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and again keep the dots tiny because you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.610 
and again keep the dots tiny because you
don't<00:03:00.330> want<00:03:00.510> glue<00:03:00.780> seeping<00:03:01.020> out<00:03:01.230> everywhere

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
don't want glue seeping out everywhere

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.070 
don't want glue seeping out everywhere
and<00:03:01.680> making<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> big<00:03:02.280> mess<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:03.690> all<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> do

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
and making a big mess so that's all I do

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.630 
and making a big mess so that's all I do
and<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:06.959> going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.740> press<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.520> onto

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and then I'm just going to press it onto

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:21.220 
and then I'm just going to press it onto
my<00:03:08.970> card<00:03:09.150> front

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230

down so that is the finished card front
super<00:03:46.110> simple<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:47.459> leave<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.700> like<00:03:47.819> that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
read my blog for well knows that I don't

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.130 
read my blog for well knows that I don't
leave<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.970> insides<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.510> my<00:03:54.629> card<00:03:54.870> blank

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
leave the insides of my card blank

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.000 
leave the insides of my card blank
because<00:03:55.409> it<00:03:55.890> just<00:03:56.069> drives<00:03:56.280> me<00:03:56.430> nuts<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:58.010> again

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
because it just drives me nuts so again

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.440 
because it just drives me nuts so again
kind<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.459> with<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.730> simple<00:04:00.090> theme<00:04:00.269> you

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
kind of going with the simple theme you

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.490 
kind of going with the simple theme you
could<00:04:00.569> die<00:04:00.690> come<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.019> hello<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.349> wanna

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
could die come in the hello if you wanna

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.509 
could die come in the hello if you wanna
but<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.680> think<00:04:01.829> that'd<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:01.950> kind<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.190> redundant

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
but I think that'd be kind of redundant

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.740
