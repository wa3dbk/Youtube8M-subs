 expires qigong meditation sophrology 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 auriculotherapy hypnosis or even 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 acupuncture as much therapeutic 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 which gives rise to a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460
 growing infatuation with this finding 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 public assistance hospitals of paris 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.789
 decided to introduce twenty or so 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.010
 complementary approach in these 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.170
 hospitals of which one third in medicine 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.449
 traditional Chinese 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.689
 it's really a very big opening 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.730
 on a completely different medicine 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.590
 in totally empirical but who it is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 proven 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
 it's not about replacing our 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.870
 treatments with other treatments 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 it is a question of completing them where we have not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 not much to offer the patient or 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.219
 well at the cost of treatment with 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.020
 extremely side effects 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.579
 extremely important a center of 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 Chinese medicine was even created 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.149
 last year at the hospital of pity 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.109
 salpêtrière 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.390
 among the treatments proposed in 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.580
 gynecology obstetrics acupuncture 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 so since the last time how did that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 go side pain there cannes a 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 improvement or not at all I'm fine 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.520
 naked her health to improve a midwife 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.560
 trained in this traditional technique 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.939
 Chinese supports women 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 pregnant suffering from pain 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.439
 lumbar and pelvic she is assisted 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.930
 by a gynecologist from China in 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.340
 the partnership framework with the help of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.520
 fine needles some points are 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.469
 targeted to relieve patients 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.990
 blow 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.579
 this one sees there it'll be on one point 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.240
 to use it for treatments 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.009
 initiatory 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 so it will allow to circulate 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.539
 the energy in the meridian that is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.770
 painful it is something that is 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.590
 not really proven yet 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.329
 scientifically helmet at the meridian but 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.789
 the theory of Chinese medicine is 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.750
 that with our needle we will come to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.579
 touch the energy eon will act on the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 circulation of energy either by bringing 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.289
 his lot removed on the do better 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.970
 to circulate traditional medicine 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.000
 is based on an approach and a 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.880
 philosophy very different from ours 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.510
 the western house maybe the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.480
 head yeste pain in the season 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.970
 local only and the mass 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.129
 Traditional Chinese is different 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.230
 because all it's here is in 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.930
 make a point here for 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.670
 we will improve the doubs the success 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 it's traditional medicine 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.159
 Chinese salt all body together 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.230
 cage plan they have it in the Roman bag 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.310
 Yes OK 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.440
 yet skeptical before trying 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 sylvia eight months pregnant we are at her 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.510
 third session and she is already seeing 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.269
 the beneficial effects on his sciatica 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.700
 at the level of a scale from 6 2 2 0 to 17 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.049
 between 6 and 7 of pain before and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.860
 now I am between one and two 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.879
 so I'm convinced yeah 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.620
 according to the first results of 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.420
 research protocol the pain 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.819
 halves after three sessions 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.769
 from acupuncture to medium as to 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.290
 consultations at sector tariff 1 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.090
 they do not fill up the data 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.840
 important when evaluating these 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.640
 therapeutic 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.950
 we chose to put ourselves in 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.420
 an optics that is both pragmatic 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.190
 do not want to know how does the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
 culture if they walk by an effect to 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.489
 super placebo effect or by 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.040
 psychological mechanisms that we 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.109
 let's not even ignore it's not a 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.910
 question the question is is it that 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.590
 walk enough so that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.709
 the investment enters with presents itself 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.930
 worth it for a community 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.060
 hospital 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.620
 once this experimentation phase 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.510
 completed if the practices are valid 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.579
 and other health professionals 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.930
 should be added to the 30 of practitioners 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.190
 already trained in medicine 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.940
 in hospitals 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.940
