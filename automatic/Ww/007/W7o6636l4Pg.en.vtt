00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello very good to all guys and girls 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.760
 we are here in another a boxing that you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.460
 I promised yesterday that is this edition 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.530
 limited is pla tun the truth that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.350
 it's pretty cool the box is very 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.980
 representative as you see nintendo follows 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.170
 in his tonic of making these boxes like this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.450
 rectangular roll with the wiiu symbol 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.059
 of some characteristic graphic series 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.640
 of the title and good in the one of jairo 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.700
 uruguayos by mario kart always 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.129
 included some accessory let's say some 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.160
 some object not to exhibit but now 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.710
 because he has given to put friends in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.559
 all your collectors editions and is 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.929
 because it has a very characteristic one that is 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.659
 let's say the way they have without 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.749
 clint when they go surfing the ink 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.550
 the way to squid the pure form and 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.190
 this figure as I commented yesterday is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.129
 exclusive in Europe of this edition in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.409
 you can get it separately and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.990
 also in Japan that what I have done is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.159
 acquire one more copy in Japan when 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.079
 there was the figure 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.719
 to nine euros now has gone up a 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.969
 little bit so I can have this 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.789
 figure sealed inside the edition 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.619
 since always the figure of these of 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.259
 nintendo that come in plan with the pack 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.999
 I like to keep them say in your 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.030
 initial state not within the edition 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:32.130
 so he does not lose value and bought me 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.709
 part another as the friends are region 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.500
 free to be able to use it in the game and 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:40.049
 apart I also came with the reservation 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.689
 of the game this backpack is pla tuna that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.979
 it's like you see a cloth bag for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.829
 to be able to put food water and so on 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.479
 I imagine that I will use it for when I go out 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.310
 run and so when I take the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.270
 little bottle of water because they are always 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.759
 backpacks are pretty good let's not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.069
 something simple but good a detail a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.989
 detail and nothing we will open the edition 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.349
 since I think it's a boxing will be 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.660
 pretty fast, let's see if it's 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.610
 something else that I think not just the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.970
 game and friend 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.220
 let's see it there you see the content of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.020
 the edition and let's see the friend that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.930
 As I mentioned, I will not open it 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.290
 I'll leave it on your list but if I 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.010
 let's see more in detail as you see the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.830
 base is similar to that of friends 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.930
 displaced that I showed you yesterday if you 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.270
 you see is exactly the same in the big 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.150
 paint stain with the two droplets 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.000
 there nothing more that now they have put the 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.520
 figure with let's say the base like that is 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.650
 jumping to the squid that's the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.690
 difference but the base so I'm 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.760
 seeing is more or less the same as the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.340
 the others only that they have placed a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.110
 based on paint and apart from 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.740
 doll over the truth that is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.960
 Pretty cool in some shopping video 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.150
 what I do in the future I will teach you that 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.150
 Japanese version that I mentioned to you already 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.120
 without the blister but it is at the moment as 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.520
 I say I'll keep leading the dlc 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.300
 this figure like the others of 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.980
 splash do not it is this armor 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.590
 that the truth that is pretty cool 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.330
 it seems like a robot makes me cool 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.620
 quite a weapon is also seen 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.989
 characteristic and such 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.540
 very cool very cool well let's go to 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.480
 leave this inkling around here and we're going to 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.280
 take out the game that I imagine will be the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.530
 European version 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.959
 if indeed the one that I have here this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.630
 symbol that we do not like to 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.459
 collectors as it spoils a little 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.370
 what is the cover is very cool 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.130
 details of the painting here in the logo 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.400
 of wiiu and let's say it breaks a bit 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.739
 the scheme of the boxes showing something 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 more singular not as for example the 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.920
 boxes of xbox one or playstation 4 that 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.660
 they are all as very gridded no os 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.420
 you set for example those of one always the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.640
 side is gray with the name always on 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.010
 plan with the logo and such nintendo always 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.930
 try to give a little personality to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.090
 their games and especially also the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.430
 Perez's own game usually have 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.430
 some pretty silkscreen 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.530
 and now let's see what content has 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.229
 For now, as I said the disc 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.770
 very nice with a series I was pretty 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.830
 squid of the squids swimming in both 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.129
 directions and let's see if by 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.840
 chance will bring something remember also 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.669
 that the nintendo games from 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.439
 now they no longer carry stars code 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.680
 of that code for the catalog of 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.650
 stars simply because as you see 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.860
 here, well, take these instructions 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.789
 this seems to be simply the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.729
 pal system of each of each citizen of 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.889
 each place is worth it, well, this is 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.590
 it would be the unboxing as you see it is quite 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.979
 I briefly tell you that when you see this 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.650
 I'll have video and analysis already done 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.629
 that the edition came to me Tuesday from this 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.599
 week what happens is that I could not 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:19.000
 upload the video so far and the analysis 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.889
 I'll have it as soon as possible if I do not 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.199
 I have in a ratillo I have it already 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.449
 tomorrow morning and nothing I hope that 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.050
 you liked it and you know how to like it 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.120
