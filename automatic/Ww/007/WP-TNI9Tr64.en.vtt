00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:09.260
 makeup with glasses tricks and tips 

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.180
 to make a makeup with glasses 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.280
 we have to take into account the frame and 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.260
 the prescription is to say if we have 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.260
 myopia hyperopia or astigmatism 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 If you use contact lenses, always apply them 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 before applying makeup or otherwise 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.609
 you wear glasses you will have to get close 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.470
 To the mirror use a magnifying mirror 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.470
 or with a hand mirror 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.030
 lately the skin is very fresh 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.010
 and very natural for that reason for the newspaper os 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.500
 I recommend that you use something very light 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.810
 or a drink of cream that yes if you take 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.240
 glasses it is important that I illuminate jce well 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.550
 the whole area of the dark circles to avoid 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.070
 that are dark and make us shadows 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.739
 and think about fixing the makeup 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.290
 especially in this area if you have 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.300
 astigmatism the crystal does not modify the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.180
 size of your eye but if you suffer 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.920
 myopia the eye looks smaller so 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.090
 I recommend you use shadows 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.579
 clear 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.890
 what you can do is catch a shadow 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.240
 of taupe color apply it right in the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 fold to give volume 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.650
 delineate the eye in black or brown 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.890
 with a white cream-colored pencil 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.530
 make up the water line we illuminate the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.170
 eyebrow and lacrimal arch we use 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.680
 the eyelashes to open the look and the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.500
 we work well 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.260
 we apply several layers and ready 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.600
 If you have hyperopia in this case, 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.940
 eyes always look bigger because of that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 to compensate you can use smoked 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.920
 or dark shadows and I recommend that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 avoid using all over the eyelid one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.400
 pearly shade blur well the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.140
 smoked so you do not see cuts 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.020
 you can make up the water line in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.320
 black or brown and with a single layer of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.539
 mascara you will have enough 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.850
 if the glasses are very striking better 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.830
 use soft makeups and if the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.540
 eyes you leave them softer you can 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 make up a little more the lips 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.180
 If your saddle is thick os 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.060
 I recommend that you use an outline that 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 be marked thick with very shadows 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.260
 soft 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.670
 and as the cap of the glasses is all 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.459
 the attention to your look 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.540
 we have to wear our eyebrows well 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.540
 arranged and made up 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.960
