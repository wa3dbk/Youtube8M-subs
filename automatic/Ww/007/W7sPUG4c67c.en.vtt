we can program that to fly where we want

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.560 
we can program that to fly where we want

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
it and when we wanted to I have to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.570 
it and when we wanted to I have to
confess<00:02:26.080> some<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.860> groups<00:02:27.100> I've<00:02:27.280> seen<00:02:27.489> you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
confess some of the groups I've seen you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.190 
confess some of the groups I've seen you
out<00:02:27.640> there<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.910> looks<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.239> anybody<00:02:28.840> can<00:02:29.080> have

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
out there it looks like anybody can have

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.199 
out there it looks like anybody can have
a<00:02:29.230> go<00:02:29.410> we've<00:02:30.190> seen<00:02:30.340> over<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> last<00:02:30.700> 10<00:02:31.180> years

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
a go we've seen over the last 10 years

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.720 
a go we've seen over the last 10 years
the<00:02:31.720> price<00:02:32.350> has<00:02:32.590> come<00:02:32.799> right<00:02:33.340> down<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the price has come right down the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.340 
the price has come right down the
capabilities<00:02:34.239> gone<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.630> at<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.959> same<00:02:35.140> time

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
capabilities gone up at the same time

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.110 
capabilities gone up at the same time
and<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.769> enables<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.459> lot<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.700> people<00:02:37.000> to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
and so this enables a lot of people to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.990 
and so this enables a lot of people to
start<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.480> use<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.750> technology<00:02:38.580> however<00:02:39.580> in

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
start to use this technology however in

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
start to use this technology however in

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
are getting really exciting we were down

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.649 
are getting really exciting we were down
to<00:04:36.710> four<00:04:36.740> contenders<00:04:37.340> one's<00:04:37.880> been<00:04:38.150> wiped<00:04:38.449> out

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
to four contenders one's been wiped out

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.450 
to four contenders one's been wiped out
at<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.900> preliminary<00:04:39.110> stage<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.159> we're<00:04:40.310> down

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
at the preliminary stage so we're down

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.820 
at the preliminary stage so we're down
to<00:04:40.580> three<00:04:40.610> ones<00:04:41.539> just<00:04:41.780> crashed<00:04:42.199> and<00:04:42.440> started<00:04:42.740> a

to three ones just crashed and started a

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.040 
to three ones just crashed and started a
grass<00:04:43.070> fire<00:04:43.430> we're<00:04:44.090> waiting<00:04:44.300> for<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.630> radio

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
grass fire we're waiting for the radio

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.930 
grass fire we're waiting for the radio
transmitters<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.860> come<00:04:46.009> back<00:04:46.340> off<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.699> crash

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
transmitters to come back off the crash

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.180 
transmitters to come back off the crash
plane<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.509> then<00:04:48.110> we<00:04:48.259> can<00:04:48.440> launch<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.740> next

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
plane and then we can launch the next

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.830 
plane and then we can launch the next
entrant<00:04:49.520> which<00:04:49.970> is<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.300> Queensland

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
entrant which is the Queensland

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.970 
entrant which is the Queensland
University<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.530> Technology

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
University of Technology

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.220 
University of Technology
the<00:04:53.460> stakes<00:04:53.850> are<00:04:54.120> even<00:04:54.330> higher<00:04:54.510> for<00:04:54.840> this

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
the stakes are even higher for this

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.930 
the stakes are even higher for this
thing<00:04:55.560> because<00:04:55.980> their<00:04:56.250> degrees<00:04:56.700> are

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
thing because their degrees are

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.839 
thing because their degrees are
depending<00:04:57.540> on<00:04:57.660> their<00:04:57.930> plane<00:04:58.260> being<00:04:58.620> success

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
depending on their plane being success

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.019 
depending on their plane being success
but<00:05:01.449> all<00:05:01.569> too<00:05:01.809> soon<00:05:01.839> the<00:05:02.339> QUT<00:05:03.339> plane<00:05:03.639> is<00:05:03.849> out<00:05:03.999> of

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.029 
but all too soon the QUT plane is out of

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:11.219 
but all too soon the QUT plane is out of
sight<00:05:05.429> and<00:05:06.429> out<00:05:06.759> of<00:05:06.819> power<00:05:09.869> what<00:05:10.869> happened

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
sight and out of power what happened

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.040 
sight and out of power what happened
those<00:05:11.619> strong<00:05:12.219> wind<00:05:12.459> and<00:05:12.909> we<00:05:13.089> think<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.599> the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
those strong wind and we think that the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.019 
those strong wind and we think that the
autopilot<00:05:14.740> was<00:05:15.039> trying<00:05:15.399> to<00:05:15.490> change<00:05:15.699> some

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 
autopilot was trying to change some

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.359 
autopilot was trying to change some
gains<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.719> unfortunately<00:05:17.589> it's<00:05:17.860> gone<00:05:18.069> down

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:18.369 
gains and unfortunately it's gone down

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.669 
gains and unfortunately it's gone down
it's<00:05:19.029> disappointing<00:05:19.270> because<00:05:19.869> we<00:05:20.139> know<00:05:20.319> it

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:20.679 
it's disappointing because we know it

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:22.350 
it's disappointing because we know it
can<00:05:20.860> do<00:05:21.039> better<00:05:21.249> than<00:05:21.459> that<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:22.119> must<00:05:22.300> be

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
can do better than that that must be

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.299 
can do better than that that must be
time<00:05:22.599> for<00:05:22.629> commiseration<00:05:23.319> drinks<00:05:24.179> definitely

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309 
time for commiseration drinks definitely

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.839 
time for commiseration drinks definitely
so<00:05:27.309> it<00:05:27.459> looks<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:27.759> it's<00:05:28.119> all<00:05:28.449> over<00:05:29.669> but<00:05:30.669> then

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
so it looks like it's all over but then

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.699 
so it looks like it's all over but then
at<00:05:30.969> the<00:05:31.029> last<00:05:31.179> minute<00:05:31.509> we<00:05:31.689> had<00:05:31.839> a<00:05:31.869> reentry<00:05:32.559> a

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:32.709 
at the last minute we had a reentry a

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.769 
at the last minute we had a reentry a
thing<00:05:33.069> we<00:05:33.249> thought<00:05:33.490> was<00:05:33.699> scratched<00:05:34.029> when<00:05:34.629> the

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:34.779 
thing we thought was scratched when the

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.659 
thing we thought was scratched when the
pilot<00:05:34.990> accidentally<00:05:35.709> sprayed<00:05:35.919> petrol<00:05:36.490> in<00:05:36.550> his

to<00:05:49.869> increase<00:05:50.319> crop<00:05:50.679> yields<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:51.550> it<00:05:51.849> certainly

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:52.119 
to increase crop yields and it certainly

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:53.820 
to increase crop yields and it certainly
looks<00:05:52.419> like<00:05:52.629> they<00:05:52.809> know<00:05:53.019> what<00:05:53.199> they're<00:05:53.379> doing

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
looks like they know what they're doing

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.369 
looks like they know what they're doing
they've<00:05:54.819> even<00:05:55.089> drafted<00:05:55.330> in<00:05:55.629> an<00:05:55.779> autopilot
