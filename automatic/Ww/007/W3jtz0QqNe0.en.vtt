okay<00:00:02.100> so<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.610> was<00:00:02.820> trying<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.270> fight<00:00:03.480> figure<00:00:03.959> out

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay so I was trying to fight figure out

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.860 
okay so I was trying to fight figure out
how<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.069> mount<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:06.150> acrylic<00:00:06.660> on

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
how I'm going to mount my acrylic on

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410 
how I'm going to mount my acrylic on
these<00:00:07.170> little<00:00:07.470> L<00:00:07.740> frames<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.370> really<00:00:09.179> wanted

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
these little L frames I really wanted

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.080 
these little L frames I really wanted
something<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.759> an<00:00:11.880> L

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
something that was actually like an L

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.459 
something that was actually like an L
where<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.630> side<00:00:12.870> would<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:13.380> bit

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
where one side would be a little bit

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.340 
where one side would be a little bit
longer<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.980> twice<00:00:14.219> as<00:00:14.370> long<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.150> other

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
longer like twice as long as the other

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.810 
longer like twice as long as the other
but<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.859> had<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> deal<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
but this is what I had to deal with and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.769 
but this is what I had to deal with and
I<00:00:18.660> was<00:00:19.020> pretty<00:00:19.230> concerned<00:00:19.730> but<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> went

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
I was pretty concerned but when I went

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.529 
I was pretty concerned but when I went
out<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.140> bought<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.850> drill<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.180> couple<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
out I bought a drill bit a couple of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.320 
out I bought a drill bit a couple of
drill<00:00:24.750> bits<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.289> Milwaukee<00:00:26.330> titanium

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
drill bits like Milwaukee titanium

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.919 
drill bits like Milwaukee titanium
tipped<00:00:28.170> bits<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:29.240> don't<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> brand<00:00:30.750> name

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
tipped bits I don't know the brand name

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.720 
tipped bits I don't know the brand name
L<00:00:31.109> oh<00:00:31.439> I've<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> spare<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.340> I'll<00:00:32.579> bring

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
L oh I've got a spare one I'll bring

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.490 
L oh I've got a spare one I'll bring
over<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> show<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.600> guys<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:36.500> that's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
over and show you guys but that's that's

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.479 
over and show you guys but that's that's
it<00:00:37.739> right<00:00:37.920> there

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it right there

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
it right there
I<00:00:38.780> went<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.110> looking<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.920> five

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I went and I was looking for a five

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.840 
I went and I was looking for a five
millimeter<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:42.920> because<00:00:43.920> our<00:00:44.250> 5<00:00:44.399> millimeter

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
millimeter bit because our 5 millimeter

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.639 
millimeter bit because our 5 millimeter
LEDs<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.629> figured<00:00:45.870> something<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.410> tad

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
LEDs I figured something just a tad

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.490 
LEDs I figured something just a tad
bigger<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.370> perfect<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.140> I<00:00:49.140> ended<00:00:49.410> up

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
bigger would be perfect and I ended up

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
bigger would be perfect and I ended up
getting<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.399> thirteen<00:00:50.850> sixty

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
getting I think it was thirteen sixty

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.189 
getting I think it was thirteen sixty
fourths<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.289> size<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> bit<00:00:54.199> we'll

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
fourths is the size of the bit we'll

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
fourths is the size of the bit we'll
check<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> second<00:00:56.120> drill<00:00:57.120> through<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
check that in a second drill through the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.069 
check that in a second drill through the
aluminum<00:00:57.949> fairly<00:00:58.949> easily<00:00:59.660> mostly<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.780> had

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
aluminum fairly easily mostly I just had

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.709 
aluminum fairly easily mostly I just had
to<00:01:01.460> make<00:01:02.460> sure<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.670> batteries<00:01:03.210> were<00:01:03.359> charged

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to make sure my batteries were charged

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
to make sure my batteries were charged
because<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.409> weren't<00:01:04.589> fully<00:01:05.280> charged<00:01:05.700> when

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
because they weren't fully charged when

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
because they weren't fully charged when
I<00:01:05.970> started<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> only<00:01:07.920> real

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I started so that's the only real

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.710 
I started so that's the only real
obstacle<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.210> managed<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> get

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
obstacle I had but I managed to get

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
obstacle I had but I managed to get
through<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.170> three<00:01:10.560> foot<00:01:10.799> pieces<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:13.610> now

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
through two three foot pieces and now

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
through two three foot pieces and now
we're<00:01:15.170> starting<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.320> grabbing<00:01:16.920> life<00:01:17.070> felt

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
we're starting from grabbing life felt

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.890 
we're starting from grabbing life felt
marker<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> end<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
marker and you know to the end of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.640 
marker and you know to the end of
dealing<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.229> holes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
dealing my holes

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
dealing my holes
they're<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.070> exactly<00:01:23.189> perfectly<00:01:23.880> straight

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
they're not exactly perfectly straight

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.609 
they're not exactly perfectly straight
but<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> figure<00:01:24.810> maybe<00:01:25.020> that'll<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.470> help

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but I figure maybe that'll just help

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.850 
but I figure maybe that'll just help
with<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> total<00:01:26.549> internal<00:01:26.939> reflection

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
with the total internal reflection

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.260 
with the total internal reflection
having<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> LEDs<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.180> know

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
having some of the LEDs you know

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.760 
having some of the LEDs you know
entering<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> acrylic<00:01:31.200> surface<00:01:31.590> at

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
entering the acrylic surface at

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.859 
entering the acrylic surface at
different<00:01:31.799> points<00:01:35.270> yes<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.600> it'll

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
different points yes and I think it'll

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.370 
different points yes and I think it'll
be<00:01:36.990> fine

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
be fine

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.340 
be fine
so<00:01:38.299> as<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.720> turns<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.820> works<00:01:42.630> better

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so as it turns out this works better

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.980 
so as it turns out this works better
than<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.770> ever<00:01:43.950> could<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.369> dreamed<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> here's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
than I ever could have dreamed so here's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
than I ever could have dreamed so here's
my<00:01:49.140> 3-foot<00:01:49.530> piece<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> holes<00:01:50.159> drilled

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
my 3-foot piece with the holes drilled

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.719 
my 3-foot piece with the holes drilled
in<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.470> obviously<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.710> sit<00:01:53.310> under<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
in it obviously it will sit under the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.450 
in it obviously it will sit under the
acrylic<00:01:54.890> something<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:58.430> plan<00:01:59.430> on

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
acrylic something like this I plan on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.109 
acrylic something like this I plan on
putting<00:01:59.759> some<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:01.320> foam<00:02:01.560> tape<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
putting some like some foam tape and the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.760 
putting some like some foam tape and the
bottom<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> kind<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> cushion<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
bottom down here to kind of cushion the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.350 
bottom down here to kind of cushion the
acrylic<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.310> maybe<00:02:05.520> raise<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.119> by<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
acrylic and maybe raise it up by a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.930 
acrylic and maybe raise it up by a
millimeter<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.459> holes<00:02:08.670> line<00:02:08.910> up

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
millimeter or two so the holes line up

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729

millimeter<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.980> perfect<00:02:45.459> size<00:02:45.670> I'm

not<00:02:46.570> plugging<00:02:46.780> Milwaukee<00:02:47.380> here<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:49.770> mean<00:02:50.770> I've

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
not plugging Milwaukee here I mean I've

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.970 
not plugging Milwaukee here I mean I've
got<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> titanium<00:02:51.489> bit<00:02:51.970> because<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.890> figured<00:02:53.890> I'm

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
got a titanium bit because I figured I'm

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.140 
got a titanium bit because I figured I'm
drilling<00:02:54.130> through<00:02:54.340> aluminum<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:54.910> don't<00:02:55.030> want

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
drilling through aluminum I don't want

to<00:02:55.209> make<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> bit<00:02:55.570> last<00:02:55.780> long<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.440> bought

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
to make the bit last long so I bought

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.870 
to make the bit last long so I bought
two<00:02:56.770> bits<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.130> figured<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.489> would<00:02:57.610> work<00:02:57.700> out

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
two bits I figured that would work out

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.960 
two bits I figured that would work out
long<00:02:58.390> enough<00:02:58.510> but<00:02:59.190> I'm<00:03:00.190> not<00:03:00.340> speaking<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.880> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
long enough but I'm not speaking to the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.870 
long enough but I'm not speaking to the
brand<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.770> size<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.250> bit<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.670> is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
brand just the size of the bit this is

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.940 
brand just the size of the bit this is
the<00:03:04.060> perfect<00:03:04.510> size<00:03:04.660> thirteen<00:03:05.200> sixty<00:03:05.620> fourths

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
the perfect size thirteen sixty fourths

the perfect size thirteen sixty fourths
or<00:03:06.160> five<00:03:06.760> point<00:03:07.000> one<00:03:07.090> six<00:03:07.300> millimeter<00:03:10.140> because

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
or five point one six millimeter because

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:23.250 
or five point one six millimeter because
here<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:13.300> holes<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.620> will<00:03:14.830> grab<00:03:22.049> here<00:03:23.049> we<00:03:23.110> go

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
here my holes and I will grab here we go

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.530 
here my holes and I will grab here we go
here's<00:03:23.709> one<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> 45<00:03:24.370> 50s<00:03:24.850> I'm<00:03:25.120> not<00:03:25.330> using

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
here's one of the 45 50s I'm not using

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.630 
here's one of the 45 50s I'm not using
these<00:03:25.810> ones<00:03:26.049> but<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> good<00:03:26.799> way<00:03:27.580> to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
these ones but this is a good way to

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.190 
these ones but this is a good way to
show<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.230> at<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.380> bottom<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.970> le<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.209> any<00:03:31.690> LED

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
show it at the bottom of le of any LED

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.570 
show it at the bottom of le of any LED
and<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.560> never<00:03:32.769> really<00:03:32.950> noticed<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.400> before

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
and I never really noticed this before

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.060 
and I never really noticed this before
there's<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.630> little<00:03:34.930> Ridge<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:35.830> kind<00:03:36.010> of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
there's a little Ridge you can kind of

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.890 
there's a little Ridge you can kind of
see<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.840> got<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.080> lip<00:03:38.350> at<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.590> bottom

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
see it it's got like a lip at the bottom

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.710 
see it it's got like a lip at the bottom
which<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:42.310> big<00:03:42.519> enough<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:43.060> stop<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.450> LED

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
which is just big enough to stop the LED

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.479 
which is just big enough to stop the LED
from<00:03:43.870> going<00:03:44.049> all<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> way<00:03:44.350> through<00:03:44.560> with<00:03:45.310> this

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
from going all the way through with this

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.500 
from going all the way through with this
size<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.850> hole<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:47.380> as<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:48.870> put<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.260> hole

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
size of hole so as I put it in the hole

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.270 
size of hole so as I put it in the hole
it<00:03:52.510> stops<00:03:52.900> right<00:03:53.170> there<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.560> will<00:03:53.709> not<00:03:53.890> go<00:03:54.040> any

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
it stops right there it will not go any

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.600 
it stops right there it will not go any
further

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
further

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.330 
further

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
oops there we go I'm pushing on it it's

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.690 
oops there we go I'm pushing on it it's
not<00:04:00.549> going<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.260> it's<00:04:02.500> holding<00:04:03.340> there<00:04:03.489> very

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
not going so it's holding there very

should buy some perf board and cut it

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.170 
should buy some perf board and cut it
into<00:04:11.709> strips<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.370> then<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.700> attach<00:04:13.030> the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.699 
perf board to the inside of your frame I
thought<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.430> doing<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.700> but<00:04:16.709> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
thought of doing that but the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.949 
thought of doing that but the

electronics retailer here in town is the

electronics retailer here in town is the
only<00:04:20.109> one<00:04:20.410> in<00:04:20.530> town<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:20.950> they<00:04:21.070> charge<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.489> lot

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
only one in town so they charge a lot

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.900 
only one in town so they charge a lot
and<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.289> was<00:04:23.410> like<00:04:23.530> 10<00:04:23.770> bucks<00:04:24.070> for<00:04:24.310> four<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:24.880> a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
and it was like 10 bucks for four and a

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.680 
and it was like 10 bucks for four and a
half<00:04:24.940> by<00:04:25.330> 6<00:04:25.690> inch<00:04:25.900> bore

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
half by 6 inch bore

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.240 
half by 6 inch bore
and<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.110> would<00:04:27.290> have<00:04:27.410> needed<00:04:27.590> like<00:04:27.920> five<00:04:28.220> of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
and I would have needed like five of

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.710 
and I would have needed like five of
them<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.850> thought<00:04:29.000> that's<00:04:29.210> too<00:04:29.390> much<00:04:29.480> money

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
them and I thought that's too much money

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.860 
them and I thought that's too much money
so<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.410> went<00:04:31.190> with<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.400> drill<00:04:31.670> idea<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.630> is

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
so I went with a drill idea and this is

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.190 
so I went with a drill idea and this is
working<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:33.320> well<00:04:33.800> here's<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:36.050> other

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
working so well here's the the other

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.830 
working so well here's the the other
kind<00:04:36.530> of<00:04:36.710> 45<00:04:37.340> P<00:04:37.610> or<00:04:37.790> whatever<00:04:38.120> it's<00:04:38.270> called<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.540 

it's<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.080> same<00:04:42.320> size<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.950> it<00:04:43.100> fits<00:04:43.310> through

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
it's the same size and it fits through

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.970 
it's the same size and it fits through
and<00:04:44.540> with<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.690> nice<00:04:44.870> flat<00:04:45.170> head<00:04:45.470> on<00:04:45.650> it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
and with a nice flat head on it

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.110 
and with a nice flat head on it
look<00:04:46.610> at<00:04:46.730> how<00:04:46.790> much<00:04:46.910> is<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:51.970> look<00:04:52.970> at<00:04:53.060> how

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
look at how much is that look at how

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.290 
look at how much is that look at how
much<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.390> sticks<00:04:53.630> through<00:04:53.840> barely<00:04:54.620> at<00:04:54.800> all<00:04:55.300> so

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
much it sticks through barely at all so

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.770 
much it sticks through barely at all so
I've<00:04:56.390> got<00:04:56.540> all<00:04:56.570> this<00:04:56.870> extra<00:04:57.260> room<00:04:57.590> down<00:04:58.070> here

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
I've got all this extra room down here

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.940 
I've got all this extra room down here
to<00:04:59.780> mount<00:05:00.160> my<00:05:01.160> acrylic<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.820> frame<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:03.740> is

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
to mount my acrylic to the frame that is

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.620 
to mount my acrylic to the frame that is
so<00:05:04.250> great<00:05:05.800> obviously<00:05:07.000> or<00:05:08.000> maybe<00:05:08.390> it's<00:05:08.570> not

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
so great obviously or maybe it's not

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.360 
so great obviously or maybe it's not
obvious<00:05:09.140> I<00:05:09.380> might<00:05:09.560> be<00:05:09.650> out<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.800> lunch<00:05:10.010> I<00:05:10.190> don't

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
obvious I might be out to lunch I don't

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.800 
obvious I might be out to lunch I don't
know<00:05:10.460> on<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.480> back<00:05:11.630> here<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.020> have<00:05:12.560> to<00:05:12.710> get<00:05:12.860> some

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
know on the back here I have to get some

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.170 
know on the back here I have to get some
final<00:05:14.810> paper<00:05:15.230> or<00:05:15.620> some<00:05:15.830> felt<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:16.520> something

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
final paper or some felt or something

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.910 
final paper or some felt or something
just<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.420> cover<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.810> back<00:05:18.080> of<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.320> aluminum<00:05:18.770> I

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
just to cover the back of the aluminum I

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.790 
just to cover the back of the aluminum I
don't<00:05:19.580> think<00:05:19.850> that's<00:05:20.200> like<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.230> 12-volt

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
don't think that's like a 12-volt

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.350 
don't think that's like a 12-volt
current<00:05:22.250> or<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.370> five<00:05:22.610> volt<00:05:22.850> current<00:05:23.060> or

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
current or a five volt current or

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.550 
current or a five volt current or
whatever<00:05:23.600> isn't<00:05:23.780> going<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.080> use<00:05:24.200> to<00:05:24.350> power

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
whatever isn't going to use to power

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.240 
whatever isn't going to use to power
these<00:05:24.710> LEDs<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:26.150> really<00:05:26.570> going<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:27.250> get

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
these LEDs is really going to get

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.030 
these LEDs is really going to get
shorted<00:05:28.730> out<00:05:28.880> on<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.180> aluminum<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:30.710> wouldn't

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
shorted out on the aluminum it wouldn't

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.740 
shorted out on the aluminum it wouldn't
really<00:05:31.220> follow<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.520> that's<00:05:32.150> not<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.390> path<00:05:32.570> of

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
really follow the that's not the path of

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.770 
really follow the that's not the path of
least<00:05:32.870> resistance<00:05:33.020> right<00:05:33.710> but<00:05:34.040> just<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:35.600> make

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
least resistance right but just to make

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.170 
least resistance right but just to make
sure<00:05:35.810> I'll<00:05:36.400> protect<00:05:37.400> this<00:05:37.550> with<00:05:37.790> something

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
sure I'll protect this with something

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.650 
sure I'll protect this with something
and<00:05:38.330> kind<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:39.280> poke<00:05:40.280> out<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.670> holes<00:05:40.880> so<00:05:41.270> that<00:05:41.450> I

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
and kind of poke out the holes so that I

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.409 
and kind of poke out the holes so that I
can<00:05:42.070> slaughter<00:05:43.070> all<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.400> LEDs<00:05:43.790> together<00:05:44.030> and

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
can slaughter all the LEDs together and

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.500 
can slaughter all the LEDs together and
whatever<00:05:44.600> type<00:05:45.169> of<00:05:45.200> circuit<00:05:45.710> I'm<00:05:46.510> gonna

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
whatever type of circuit I'm gonna

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.180 
whatever type of circuit I'm gonna
figure<00:05:48.110> out<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:51.380> have<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:51.620> so<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.070> they

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
figure out and and have it so that they

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.220 
figure out and and have it so that they
won't<00:05:52.310> be<00:05:52.450> touching<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.570> aluminum<00:05:54.020> at<00:05:54.110> all

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
won't be touching the aluminum at all

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.280 
won't be touching the aluminum at all
and<00:05:55.480> then<00:05:56.480> I<00:05:56.510> think<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:56.960> would<00:05:57.050> just<00:05:57.169> be

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
and then I think that would just be

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.860 
and then I think that would just be
great<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:58.060> for<00:05:59.060> those<00:05:59.210> that<00:05:59.419> are<00:05:59.540> just

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
great so for those that are just

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.390 
great so for those that are just
starting<00:06:00.320> out<00:06:00.590> and<00:06:00.650> trying<00:06:01.040> to<00:06:01.100> figure<00:06:01.370> out

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
starting out and trying to figure out

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.650 
starting out and trying to figure out
the<00:06:01.669> stuff<00:06:01.910> that<00:06:01.940> isn't<00:06:02.180> really<00:06:02.390> talked<00:06:02.600> about

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
the stuff that isn't really talked about

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.870 
the stuff that isn't really talked about
much<00:06:02.930> on<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.169> forums<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:04.400> actual<00:06:04.760> like

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
much on the forums the actual like

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.140 
much on the forums the actual like
physical<00:06:05.300> physical<00:06:06.140> construction<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:07.150> would

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
physical physical construction I would

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:18.580 
physical physical construction I would
use<00:06:08.300> this<00:06:08.480> aluminum<00:06:09.820> is<00:06:13.120> let's<00:06:14.120> see<00:06:14.390> here<00:06:17.590> one

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
use this aluminum is let's see here one

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.810 
use this aluminum is let's see here one
sixteenth<00:06:19.070> by<00:06:20.060> 3/4<00:06:20.660> by<00:06:21.080> three<00:06:21.500> feet<00:06:21.770> so<00:06:22.700> that's

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
sixteenth by 3/4 by three feet so that's

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.350 
sixteenth by 3/4 by three feet so that's
1/16<00:06:23.419> thickness<00:06:24.790> 3/4<00:06:25.790> of<00:06:25.850> an<00:06:25.970> inch<00:06:26.030> on<00:06:26.180> each

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
1/16 thickness 3/4 of an inch on each

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.390 
1/16 thickness 3/4 of an inch on each
side<00:06:26.390> I<00:06:26.960> mean<00:06:27.169> that's<00:06:27.410> a<00:06:27.710> measurement<00:06:28.130> you<00:06:28.310> can

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
side I mean that's a measurement you can

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.100 
side I mean that's a measurement you can
come<00:06:28.610> up<00:06:28.760> with<00:06:28.790> on<00:06:28.940> your<00:06:29.060> own<00:06:29.240> three<00:06:29.660> feet<00:06:29.840> long

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
come up with on your own three feet long

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.470 
come up with on your own three feet long
obviously<00:06:30.620> whatever<00:06:30.950> you<00:06:31.040> can<00:06:31.160> get<00:06:31.310> but
