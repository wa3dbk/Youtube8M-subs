00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
we're going to use just a little bit of

understanding the interval of a second

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.250 
understanding the interval of a second
now<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> second<00:00:58.980> means<00:00:59.550> distance<00:01:00.020> okay<00:01:01.020> from

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
now a second means distance okay from

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.280 
now a second means distance okay from
one<00:01:01.530> note<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> next<00:01:02.719> alright<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.019> take<00:01:04.049> a

one note to the next alright if I take a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.520 
one note to the next alright if I take a
C<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> D<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.960> an<00:01:07.200> interval

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
C and I go to the D that's an interval

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.490 
C and I go to the D that's an interval
of<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> second<00:01:08.220> Rd<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.479> e<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:09.930> e<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.350> M

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of a second Rd to an e or an e to an M

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600 
of a second Rd to an e or an e to an M
it's<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.159> consecutive<00:01:11.700> letters<00:01:12.590> alright<00:01:13.610> now

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.930 
to seeing patterns and here's the first
kind<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.590> basic<00:03:38.010> pattern<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.579> seeing<00:03:38.849> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
kind of basic pattern is seeing the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.129 
kind of basic pattern is seeing the
interval<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.420> second<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.200> beta<00:03:40.530> C<00:03:40.889> F<00:03:41.370> G<00:03:41.959> D<00:03:42.959> to

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
interval of a second so beta C F G D to

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.250 
interval of a second so beta C F G D to
e<00:03:43.169> now<00:03:44.099> come<00:03:44.310> down<00:03:44.459> here<00:03:44.609> to<00:03:44.700> eat<00:03:44.910> after<00:03:45.690> see

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
e now come down here to eat after see

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.800 
e now come down here to eat after see
how<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:46.530> first<00:03:46.889> note<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.790> what<00:03:48.359> gets<00:03:48.630> me

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
how that first note is what gets me

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.530 
how that first note is what gets me
there<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.230> then<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.889> continue<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:51.389> what

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
there and then then I continue and what

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.940 
there and then then I continue and what
I<00:03:51.569> also<00:03:51.780> do<00:03:52.049> on<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.260> side<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.650> give<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.919> a

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
I also do on the side I give you a

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.550 
I also do on the side I give you a
backing<00:03:53.549> track<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.940> play<00:03:54.180> with<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.380> can

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
backing track to play with this you can

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.140 
backing track to play with this you can
probably<00:03:55.829> look<00:03:55.980> at<00:03:56.220> this<00:03:56.370> until<00:03:56.639> this<00:03:56.910> does

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
probably look at this until this does

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.180 
probably look at this until this does
not<00:03:57.329> sound<00:03:57.720> like<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.049> song<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.829> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> just

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
not sound like a song it's going to just

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.210 
not sound like a song it's going to just
sound<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.519> bunch<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.880> nothing<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:01.079> we<00:04:02.010> do

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
sound like a bunch of nothing but we do

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.770 
sound like a bunch of nothing but we do
that<00:04:02.519> because<00:04:02.730> we<00:04:03.060> don't<00:04:03.269> want<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.660> to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
that because we don't want you to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.690 
that because we don't want you to
memorize<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.410> we<00:04:04.560> don't<00:04:04.859> want<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.489> use

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
memorize it we don't want you to use

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.550 
memorize it we don't want you to use
your<00:04:05.880> ear<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.209> memorize<00:04:06.660> because<00:04:07.109> then

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
your ear and memorize because then

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
your ear and memorize because then
you're<00:04:08.069> not<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.730> sight<00:04:09.269> waiting<00:04:09.630> anymore

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you're not in sight waiting anymore

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.420 
you're not in sight waiting anymore
okay<00:04:10.530> side<00:04:10.769> reading<00:04:10.980> goes<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.400> window

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
okay side reading goes out the window

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.750 
okay side reading goes out the window
that<00:04:11.940> ear<00:04:12.540> kicks<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:13.410> we<00:04:14.160> just<00:04:14.190> quit

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
that ear kicks in and we just quit

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.580 
that ear kicks in and we just quit
reading<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.510> music<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:15.959> don't<00:04:16.200> want<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.440> do

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
reading the music we don't want to do

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.960 
reading the music we don't want to do
that<00:04:16.829> we<00:04:16.979> want<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.190> continue<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.760> read<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
that we want to continue to read and

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.539 
that we want to continue to read and
work<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.570> part<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.260> musical<00:04:20.190> part<00:04:20.430> of

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
reading part okay so that's why we're

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.150 
reading part okay so that's why we're
doing<00:04:24.510> something<00:04:24.900> that's<00:04:25.140> not<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.650> song<00:04:25.860> or

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
with me I'll do a backing track on the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.690 

you

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.730 

see<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:01.630> played<00:05:01.900> with<00:05:02.110> even<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.560> can

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
see so I played with even you can

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.640 
see so I played with even you can
practice<00:05:03.370> your<00:05:03.900> integrals<00:05:04.900> there<00:05:05.110> with<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
practice your integrals there with the

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.340 
practice your integrals there with the
backing<00:05:05.860> track<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.460> makes<00:05:06.640> a<00:05:06.790> little<00:05:07.000> more

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
backing track it makes a little more

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.350 
backing track it makes a little more
interesting<00:05:08.350> I<00:05:08.440> think<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:09.070> practice<00:05:09.760> that<00:05:09.970> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
interesting I think to practice that the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.060 
interesting I think to practice that the
bass<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:10.750> idea<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.140> we<00:05:11.290> take<00:05:11.500> away<00:05:12.060> the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
bass the idea is we take away the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.440 
bass the idea is we take away the
memorability<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.670> and<00:05:15.820> we're<00:05:16.240> just

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
memorability to it and we're just

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.960 
memorability to it and we're just
working<00:05:16.690> on<00:05:17.170> this<00:05:17.410> one<00:05:17.710> concept<00:05:18.250> of<00:05:18.460> seconds

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
working on this one concept of seconds

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.520 
working on this one concept of seconds
so<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.510> whenever<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.960> get<00:05:20.080> out<00:05:20.230> of<00:05:20.350> real

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
so that whenever you get out of real

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.900 
so that whenever you get out of real
piece<00:05:20.740> of<00:05:20.770> music<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.340> wanted<00:05:21.640> to<00:05:21.730> play

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
piece of music and you wanted to play

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.290 
piece of music and you wanted to play
something<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.810> see<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.380> you<00:05:23.590> go<00:05:23.680> up

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
something and you see that you go up

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.570 
something and you see that you go up
he's<00:05:25.300> hone<00:05:25.600> in<00:05:25.780> on<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:25.990> first<00:05:26.230> up<00:05:26.530> to<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.740> you

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
he's hone in on that first up to a you

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.270 
he's hone in on that first up to a you
know<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.850> B<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.180> second<00:05:28.720> away<00:05:28.980> okay<00:05:30.010> and

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
know the B is a second away okay and

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.460 
know the B is a second away okay and
that's<00:05:31.060> just<00:05:31.180> how<00:05:31.300> how<00:05:31.810> your<00:05:32.050> brain<00:05:32.230> can<00:05:32.440> think

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
that's just how how your brain can think

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.020 
that's just how how your brain can think
of<00:05:32.770> it<00:05:32.890> now<00:05:33.280> we're<00:05:33.430> going<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.580> look<00:05:33.760> at<00:05:33.910> the

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
of it now we're going to look at the

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.750 
of it now we're going to look at the
second<00:05:34.480> line<00:05:34.660> there<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.490> we're<00:05:36.490> going<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.640> be

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
second line there and we're going to be

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.530

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
so the interval of a second where is you

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.750 
so the interval of a second where is you
know<00:06:02.140> the<00:06:02.230> same<00:06:02.410> thing<00:06:02.650> is<00:06:02.770> up<00:06:02.920> here<00:06:03.160> but<00:06:03.340> it's

know the same thing is up here but it's

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.850 
know the same thing is up here but it's
a<00:06:03.820> melodic<00:06:04.300> second<00:06:04.630> it's<00:06:04.870> it's<00:06:05.170> one<00:06:05.410> note<00:06:05.590> play

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
a melodic second it's it's one note play

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.190 
a melodic second it's it's one note play
than<00:06:06.070> then<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.310> very<00:06:06.490> next<00:06:06.760> one<00:06:07.060> now<00:06:07.600> your

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
than then the very next one now your

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.350 
than then the very next one now your
eyes<00:06:08.500> should<00:06:09.310> be<00:06:09.460> able<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.640> pick<00:06:09.880> those<00:06:10.120> out

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
eyes should be able to pick those out

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.210 
eyes should be able to pick those out
and<00:06:10.660> I<00:06:10.870> wrote<00:06:11.140> eighth<00:06:11.320> notes<00:06:11.680> here<00:06:11.830> so<00:06:11.860> you<00:06:12.070> can

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
and I wrote eighth notes here so you can

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.190 
and I wrote eighth notes here so you can
see<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.550> groups<00:06:12.820> do<00:06:13.420> you<00:06:13.480> to<00:06:13.720> eat<00:06:14.100> f<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.370> G<00:06:16.200> see

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
see the groups do you to eat f to G see

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.970 
see the groups do you to eat f to G see
the<00:06:17.440> beadle<00:06:17.830> all<00:06:18.310> right<00:06:18.520> but<00:06:18.970> but<00:06:19.530> every<00:06:20.530> group

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
the beadle all right but but every group

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.280 
the beadle all right but but every group
is<00:06:21.280> in<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.700> interval<00:06:22.210> of<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.450> second<00:06:22.900> from<00:06:23.110> one

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
is in the interval of a second from one

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.200 
is in the interval of a second from one
note<00:06:23.470> to<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.710> very<00:06:23.950> next<00:06:24.220> letter<00:06:24.520> it's<00:06:25.000> either

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
note to the very next letter it's either

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.050 
note to the very next letter it's either
up<00:06:25.420> or<00:06:25.570> down<00:06:25.630> but<00:06:26.470> the<00:06:26.770> idea<00:06:27.220> is<00:06:27.280> you<00:06:27.400> hone<00:06:27.850> in

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
up or down but the idea is you hone in

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.000 
up or down but the idea is you hone in
on<00:06:28.210> that<00:06:28.360> first<00:06:28.630> note<00:06:28.960> and

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:41.110 

see<00:06:35.380> gee<00:06:37.570> babe<00:06:39.070> see<00:06:40.070> that<00:06:40.280> I<00:06:40.400> know<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:40.610> not<00:06:40.940> only

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
see gee babe see that I know I not only

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.330 
see gee babe see that I know I not only
know<00:06:41.390> the<00:06:41.420> individual<00:06:42.080> notes<00:06:42.320> but<00:06:42.830> I<00:06:42.860> see<00:06:43.160> the

know the individual notes but I see the

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.860 
know the individual notes but I see the
patterns<00:06:43.850> and<00:06:44.270> you<00:06:44.330> may<00:06:44.420> say<00:06:44.570> well<00:06:44.720> that's

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
patterns and you may say well that's

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.170 
patterns and you may say well that's
that's<00:06:45.110> pretty<00:06:45.440> elementary<00:06:45.830> yes<00:06:46.730> because<00:06:46.970> I

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
that's pretty elementary yes because I

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.450 
that's pretty elementary yes because I
want<00:06:47.510> to<00:06:47.570> cover<00:06:47.750> everything<00:06:48.050> we<00:06:48.500> have<00:06:48.710> to<00:06:48.980> lay

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
want to cover everything we have to lay

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.700 
want to cover everything we have to lay
a<00:06:49.490> solid<00:06:49.910> foundation<00:06:50.210> for<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.110> rest<00:06:51.410> of<00:06:51.560> your

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
a solid foundation for the rest of your

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.190 
a solid foundation for the rest of your
reading<00:06:52.160> okay<00:06:52.520> we<00:06:53.090> don't<00:06:53.300> make<00:06:53.480> this<00:06:53.660> solid

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
reading okay we don't make this solid

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.530 
reading okay we don't make this solid
down<00:06:54.980> here<00:06:55.340> then<00:06:55.580> when<00:06:55.670> we<00:06:55.700> get<00:06:55.910> in<00:06:56.090> the<00:06:56.330> higher

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
down here then when we get in the higher

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.330 
down here then when we get in the higher
things<00:06:56.900> we<00:06:57.260> won't<00:06:57.380> have<00:06:57.530> enough<00:06:57.770> support<00:06:58.130> to

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
things we won't have enough support to

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.730 
things we won't have enough support to
continue<00:06:58.520> alright<00:06:59.450> so<00:07:00.020> again<00:07:00.350> with<00:07:00.650> the

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
continue alright so again with the

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.050 
continue alright so again with the
backing<00:07:00.980> track<00:07:01.190> would<00:07:01.550> sound<00:07:01.730> something<00:07:01.880> like

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
backing track would sound something like

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.350 
backing track would sound something like
this

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
this

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:18.640 
this
ready<00:07:03.190> go<00:07:16.720> see<00:07:17.720> so<00:07:17.930> it<00:07:17.990> kind<00:07:18.170> of<00:07:18.200> makes<00:07:18.410> it<00:07:18.620> a

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
ready go see so it kind of makes it a

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.430 
ready go see so it kind of makes it a
little<00:07:18.980> more<00:07:19.070> interesting<00:07:19.870> to<00:07:20.870> play<00:07:21.050> if<00:07:21.320> you

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
little more interesting to play if you

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.260 
little more interesting to play if you
have<00:07:21.560> a<00:07:21.590> backing<00:07:22.040> track<00:07:22.070> with<00:07:22.460> it<00:07:22.610> and<00:07:22.790> I<00:07:23.090> get

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270 
have a backing track with it and I get

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.550 
have a backing track with it and I get
backing<00:07:23.660> tracks<00:07:23.870> actually<00:07:24.230> have<00:07:24.320> four

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
backing tracks actually have four

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.200 
backing tracks actually have four
exercises<00:07:25.460> that<00:07:25.940> would<00:07:26.060> go<00:07:26.180> through

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
exercises that would go through

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.230 
exercises that would go through
extensively<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:28.280> I'll<00:07:28.640> give<00:07:28.760> you<00:07:28.820> the<00:07:28.940> tracks
