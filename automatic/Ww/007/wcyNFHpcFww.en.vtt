00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 t 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.189
 hello everyone how are you this time 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.130
 we are going to recycle some jeans either 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.010
 they are already old or that we have repaired 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.540
 and we have left the bottom part what 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.239
 first thing we're going to do is flip 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.360
 our piece of cloth on the reverse and 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.559
 let's sew in a straight line to a 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.559
 centimeter from the shore 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.970
 the next step is to join the seams 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.510
 from the sides 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.490
 and form a triangle let's accommodate 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.829
 our seams 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.670
 and we are going to sew in a straight line of this 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.920
 corner 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.500
 all this can be done with a machine 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 sewing 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.170
 it's much faster and easier 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.960
 only that I do not have one like that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.870
 that I 'm doing it like that 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.320
 remains and the same thing we are going to do with the 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.320
 another corner 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.050
 this is what we have left on both sides 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.300
 we will continue to take this little corner 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.960
 we are going to fold and we are going to give 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.960
 Stitches 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.550
 let's do the same with the other side 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.820
 since we have this we are going to accommodate very 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.820
 all right 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.930
 let's take our liquid silicone and 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.130
 let's paste 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.130
 this little eyelash 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.770
 and then we will place the silicon 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.030
 on the shore 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.950
 on the edge of the seam we made 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.440
 this is so as not to fray the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.440
 fabric and have a better presentation 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.510
 this way we will stay when we have already 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.060
 stuck our ribbon 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.519
 the next step is to place the closure 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
 If you do not have a closure of your size 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.019
 little bag do not worry you can 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.150
 fix it let's do some here 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.819
 inches simulating the rivet that already 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.159
 it brings the closure by default but we 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.560
 We will do it with thread we will give 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.890
 a few laps this is for the car 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.540
 of the closing do not leave the next step 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.420
 is to paste it 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.390
 let's put the tip of the closure 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.989
 back and put it in position 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.939
 where we need the teeth of the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.569
 closure should be above that 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:20.290
 sewing that already brings the fabric and we 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:24.459
 let's try to get to know about the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.470
 sewing that already brings our fabric so 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.040
 this way you will lose those counted 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.040
 what we do 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.890
 when we get here to the shore we go to 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.860
 perform this step we accommodate the closure 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.770
 and we put a pin illo so that 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.500
 move us and we can know and we 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.780
 our closure is perfect 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.780
 now we are going to meet him 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.400
 here we can remove our pin 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.400
 gone and continue to cook 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.370
 here we come to the shore we are going to 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.120
 fold that point again 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.830
 inside and talk a few stitches so that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.530
 our closure is well secured 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.169
 girls like that our little bag looks 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.120
 what a beautiful stay 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.220
 this is how he is 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.979
 this seam that already brought our 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.080
 bastillas pants as it helps us to 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.080
 that gives a more professional finish 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.870
 serves to cover the closure 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.900
 here I decorate with this pretty 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.540
 where you fail but it can be to decorate 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.370
 it is already to the taste of each one true this 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.820
 We can bring it in our bag 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.530
 bag and here we can save all the 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.360
 little things that sometimes we 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.170
 they lose in the bag that we do not find 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.170
 by nowhere 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.560
 The size of this pouch is optional or 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.350
 you can use the size that 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.260
 have the same if they do not have a pair of trousers 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.320
 to fix or a piece of pants 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.360
 You can do this same procedure 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.070
 with a piece of cloth that you like 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.190
 they do not necessarily have to be from a 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.430
 pants and then that is the idea 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.680
 simply to reuse what 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.380
 We have plenty when we know some 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.000
 repair on our clothes true good 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.430
 girls and that's all I hope you 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.050
 I would like very much to see them in my 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.960
 social networks to be more in 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.120
 contact with you brings you closer if you 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.760
 taste this craft give away a little finger 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.280

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.449

 Goodbye girls
