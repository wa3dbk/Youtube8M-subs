00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.149
 but I wish I had the idea 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.540
 hello people here we go another video 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.860
 here in the deep col and this one is 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.540
 really very useful 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.120
 I'll talk about some study tips. 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.460
 Yes, I can imagine this face like that. 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.260
 there had been no more arming itself, it is a 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.540
 whole week, and Sunday also has 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.220
 that being on this is a calm people 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.720
 do not panic 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.210
 I actually came here to complicate your 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.129
 life, she gives some study tips that 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.100
 work for me a lot and at least 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.930
 can also dance province then 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.790
 one of my first tips is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.809
 separate everything you will need to 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.030
 study and avoid getting out to get 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.070
 something I then put it together soon 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.960
 Because it will get a lot easier, will you? 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.149
 will not focus so much will still 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.009
 be very productive will pass you will 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.820
 end up spending less time than you 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.500
 I would think to study because I have a 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.570
 problem later I personally have 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.390
 too big problem with distraction 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.920
 so if you have it too help 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.060
 very serious is such a simple thing and 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.979
 easy 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.010
 second thing is a little more complicated 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.229
 because it will require more time but 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.700
 People, I assure you, it helps you a lot. 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.950
 even if you do not want to play a role 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.350
 Because I was born there on paper for me. 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.490
 It is much easier but it can also 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.740
 make on your cell phone 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.820
 second adams and there but just make a 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.939
 calendar 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.790
 people like this helps seriously this will 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.040
 to stay in the province of putumayo on the agenda 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.979
 you put what you have notion of home 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.799
 of evidence and there but never legendary all 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.560
 is so clearly visible and everything is clearer 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.890
 Serious people I thought not but I will not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.000
 help given calendar but cofins has changed 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.070
 my life 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.619
 the next one may be that you already do 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.079
 but it is to reinforce that this is 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.360
 very important that she is of pity 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.640
 What are you going to have the next day? 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 this is repeated again personal 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.239
 wrote the paper that is much more 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.150
 visible I know if you are like that too 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.579
 More or less, that's how it works with me. 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.280
 the next one's pretty cool because so 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.890
 You're always like I think at least 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.049
 for me always spoke for 11 hearing 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.329
 music and watch TV is in 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.739
 selection and of course we can not 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.970
 watch TV while 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.549
 lack of definition in the music the event is still 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.329
 music is very good while it is 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.950
 doing lesson 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.040
 but of course we are not a song 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.760
 What do you listen to on the radio? 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.230
 there 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 It's the ideal type to be classic but 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.590
 I'm not that fan of classical music 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.489
 then it may be that I can put 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.709
 some pop but inversion already instrumental 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.189
 so put the type of music you like 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.920
 instrumental which is very cool and 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:15.159
 having very good conversations was very very 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.170
 very cool and but remembering people 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.359
 It could be that song that you always 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.370
 sing while you're listening to the year 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.769
 The more you like but you do not 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.410
 sings knows not to happen what 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.440
 happened to me in that last round 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.250
 we go people wonder how 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.000
 I study because it is such a little confused 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.489
 all at home but then how do people the way 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.209
 well cool and it will help you a lot 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.810
 very practical and objective of 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.569
 Studying is the most of the string. 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.889
 so you will get a sheet that in this 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.829
 case was a sheet of bond 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.979
 one more sheet of paper in case it is well 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.859
 easier because it has the lines and tals and 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:02.169
 divide it into four parts as more 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:08.260
 or less how to split and on top 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:12.489
 you will write the subject and theme of the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.889
 What you will write on that sheet is 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.599
 there in these two spaces in the middle you will 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.870
 write on the right 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:23.289
 notes questions everything that roll 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.830
 during class then the teacher and 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.900
 speaking in questions is deeper 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.510
 not so basic yes to deepen 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.029
 Even your study puts you in the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.080
 right 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:41.830
 Yeah, when you get home, you go. 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.419
 make the left and it is from the bottom left 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.120
 you put all the 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.370
 the most important keywords and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.020
 who will face his studies then 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:56.200
 so if you learned about I do not know 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.080
 feudalism is you place and so goes with 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.150
 other things definitions and in the last 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.000
 space that should have left a space 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.099
 the bigger the summary you'll make 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.090
 a very basic summary of more or 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.610
 less four to six lines of the whole stm 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.550
 matter that you learn in this class does not 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.940
 I know the two classes depends how you have 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.400
 learned but you write 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.219
 but in summary then it does not cling much 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.139
 the details people to strengthen the whole 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.599
 content that you explain 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.849
 someone or it 's for yourself to your sister 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.620
 because the stuffed plush for some 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.320
 familiar to that friend who is 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.779
 more doubt but we only help a lot 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 serious is one of the things that helps the most 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.610
 time to fix content 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.820
 Hey guys, a really cool thing. 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.530
 it's you too doing 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.420
 flash card 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.940
 so you write a definition in a 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.760
 side of the card are making those 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.350
 posters it's more people do not need to do 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.000
 with that the son became more and more 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.490
 cute image 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.760
 but I need to do with sheet of paper 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:08.240
 Even I remember and I'll do it then. 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.720
 you will write a definition of a 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.530
 side and on the other you write what she 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.780
 it means obvious you're making a 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.150
 kind of a game when you have some 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.790
 free time and it 's you'll see that you 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.800
 It does not work, it does not look okay, let's go. 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.260
 studying the traffic until it is 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.530
 fun people to last tip me 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.260
 I wanted to talk about study time. 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.420
 The ideal people are 50 and 50 minutes to do 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.460
 a break of about ten minutes 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.620
 because there you really enjoy the 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.110
 studies because if you stay hours 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.480
 resulting people who can not you 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.500
 Enjoy that you take advantage of 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.690
 truth 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.250
 Can you hear some music, eat some? 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.490
 quick little thing 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.960
 people, I'm going to tell you some things that 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:05.480
 Look you can do but it's not tron 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.580
 efficient fifa text and people do not need 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.400
 sacrificing text the text group is 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.470
 important for you to be more cute 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.360
 It's just for you to score the same but that way. 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.160
 I'm going to rifar the most 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.110
 important for the test because so I 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.210
 I will not remember people, you will not. 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.120
 remember the clubs paid for their dreams 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.540
 there you also have something else all 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.030
 staff that likes to write so much 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.980
 writing is not typing this has a 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.980
 much less utility than if you 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.260
 handwriting 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.630
 so this is personal 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.590
 Good people for today, I just hope that you 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.090
 have enjoyed 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.340
 I hope it works for you too. 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.740
 leave it in the comments if you liked it 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.050
 They liked that they found a father too. 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.860
 have other tips 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.860
 So people, a big kiss here, it's nerdy. 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.860
 Pizza
