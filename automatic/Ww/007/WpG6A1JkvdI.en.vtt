just in case you guys don't get to the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.969 
just in case you guys don't get to the
air<00:01:32.250> defense<00:01:32.670> quick<00:01:32.909> enough<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.770> you'll

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
air defense quick enough so then you'll

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
air defense quick enough so then you'll
drop<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.400> healer<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.390> she<00:01:37.140> may

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
drop off your healer right then she may

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
drop off your healer right then she may
get<00:01:37.350> damaged<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> still

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
get damaged your little but it still

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.179 
get damaged your little but it still
works<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> dropped<00:01:42.479> off<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.869> clean

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
works so I dropped off my clean

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.590 
works so I dropped off my clean
reinforcements<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.820> those<00:01:45.000> Giants<00:01:45.570> were

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
reinforcements so all those Giants were

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
reinforcements so all those Giants were
distracting<00:01:46.439> they<00:01:46.920> could<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.549> stuff<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
distracting they could do some stuff and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359 
distracting they could do some stuff and
they<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:48.810> also<00:01:48.960> distract<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> Giants

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
they would also distract for the Giants

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
they would also distract for the Giants
so<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:51.240> Archer<00:01:51.630> towers<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.500> them

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
so that Archer towers going for them

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
so that Archer towers going for them
instead<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> giant<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.780> she<00:01:55.079> can't

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
instead of the giant I think she can't

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.420 
instead of the giant I think she can't
actually<00:01:55.470> reach<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> maybe<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.140> why

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
actually reach them so maybe that's why

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.420 
actually reach them so maybe that's why
but<00:01:59.430> yeah<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.640> wait<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> real<00:02:01.020> long<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.430> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
but yeah you wait a real long time you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
but yeah you wait a real long time you
wait<00:02:02.670> until<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:03.240> they've<00:02:03.570> got<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.140> lot<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
wait until like they've got a lot of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.279 
wait until like they've got a lot of
defenses<00:02:05.520> down<00:02:08.810> ok<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:09.869> he<00:02:10.170> has

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
defenses down ok so he has

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.160 
defenses down ok so he has
reinforcements<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.370> not

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.339
