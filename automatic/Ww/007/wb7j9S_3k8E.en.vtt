 dpa 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.430
 dpa 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.660
 Hainer and suddenly comes to is in the new video 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.759
 today paints are cleaned on board 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.070
 and 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.189
 that's four times in the package that cut 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.749
 Lehmann Mester 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.749
 Schmidberger Hedi page on therapy 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.589
 and now points lie 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.220
 and fast 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.780
 here 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.970
 Seals by course Sassnitz did not make it 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.730
 Store 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.560
 Chur 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 and researchers could not do that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 Larsen last year 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 and yet offers to practice 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.970
 Waas 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.520
 we also want to miss it 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 the evening was 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.010
 is 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.010
 canceled 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.250
 and on you go 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 Want to TV 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 Drum roll bitterness 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.610
 a positive 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.900
 and that's what you see 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 AR around 50 to 200 millimeters objective 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.390
 four or five percent plus 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 6 aptly occupied 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.400
 trier 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.130
 because dad keeps the pair on 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.910
 will be published yes 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 boring 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.460
 reports for Focus further improved 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.519
 2 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.019
 first times the temperatures 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:17.880
 Sun 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.750
 and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.309
 Star the pop the depth 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.119
 even prompt 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.439
 even more literature 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.439
 here it is official 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.379
 With 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.989
 in cap 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.949
 reason 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.319
 End off 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.929
 and every member 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.929
 even 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.709
 visually still the church door 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.289
 Now I think so 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.029
 Euro and 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.429
 Then we have 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.419
 here arise 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.549
 Focus 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.549
 and of course add 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.179
 percent 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.789
 Not that you alone the camera years 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.459
 Comparison a bit more 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.679
 how it looks like 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.619
 this idea is that 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.949
 5 50 to 200 millimeters can be seen objectively 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.299
 in action 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.279
 that sets at its short focal length 50 millimeters help me with half 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.549
 so wild 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.040
 m that is a little older it's objective, first of all you can not do it 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.440
 call 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.360
 eleven so far 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.039
 but there are very fast 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.039
 and very 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 and last time 9 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.939
 now sits completely separate 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:59.329
 if 70 percent at this "probably focal length wobbles it even a bit 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.429
 if I am objective 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:02.749
 jaw 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.189
 and so but that's normal 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.639
 because the objectively sale can 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.269
 where from then 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.999
 the production 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.999
 induction 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.850
 but you can see you have a bit of practice can also focus very quickly 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.169
 learn to learn 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.710
 as focus 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.490
 or minimal 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.050
 anyway 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.400
 a tenant 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.200
 and dumb so you can see Schuhmann on more as you can see 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:35.740
 how it is 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.740
 Nikon characters 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.860
 buck 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.240
 I already think her client and also Little 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.159
 so I 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.759
 am from the object Schwiersch 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.969
 I am enthusiastic but it is percent 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.370
 Nice extensions 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.819
 to my previous objective 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.819
 18 to 55 millimeters 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.839
 come for me 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:11.639
 have to 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.639
 At the same time, Fischer Weise claims 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.879
 how does the brain feel? 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.729
 that looked right at the 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.729
 Langston focal length Hans Nikol CME 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.349
 Nikon then and you 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.089
 how to change deeply 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:34.740
 with the 5 1 liter not getting on and then on 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.370
 hand off 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.469
 and how one sees this attitude very badly Â» 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.029
 he is producing real beautiful blur 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.759
 still happening off the pitch lately has become increasingly popular 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.229
 further excluded 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.670
 then you see behind it behind these 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.089
 two plates have produced 4 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.119
 times and so on 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:59.300
 Justice at the 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.180
 Kingston 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.180
 more Wilander by 5 times 6 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:06.479
 and I am here now 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.759
 when thinking more focused 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.069
 you're done with the second season so everything else 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.139
 you can do that too 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.760
 hopefully - testing 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.229
 how deep 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.460
 between suitable 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.580
 yes I think that's enough now percent 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.879
 Angela tube 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.999
 I just hope that failed for the election 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:32.589
 if that's what happened to me 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:35.589
 then I would be happy if you do not like that 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.950
 of course, with a thumbs up, it's difficult now 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:40.860
 focus 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.009
 Hikes and where you are 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.869
 that will be seen and then 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.259
 then it's easy to make even if Keeper 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.919
 and of course, percent acknowledged and you to the brother 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.800
 years 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.499
 which form 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:55.790
 I'm doing now 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.790
 to keep up with the guys lately 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.119
 that should be something involved here 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:05.360
 just my six beats Mattel exam 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.680
 pack everything 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.919
 another video 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.610
 Costs too 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.739
 So watch and that's video
