00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
retrospect now I understand it's a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.920 
retrospect now I understand it's a
little<00:02:19.480> bit<00:02:19.630> more<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:21.070> job<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.240> took<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.570> but

I'm hoping that people will enjoy what I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.740 
I'm hoping that people will enjoy what I
did<00:02:26.650> while<00:02:27.130> still<00:02:27.489> loving<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:27.910> Sally<00:02:28.269> did<00:02:28.360> as

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.180 
without giving away any spoilers um I I
think<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.180> games<00:02:55.390> are<00:02:58.170> very<00:02:59.170> intriguing<00:02:59.650> and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.470 
vocal warm-ups on the way to Moreno Rae
um<00:03:43.750> then<00:03:44.620> well<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.580> always<00:03:45.910> do<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> vocal

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
um then well I always do a vocal

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.110 
um then well I always do a vocal
warm-ups<00:03:46.930> but<00:03:47.260> because<00:03:47.560> her<00:03:48.310> voice<00:03:48.550> is<00:03:48.850> much

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
warm-ups but because her voice is much

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.690 
warm-ups but because her voice is much
smoother<00:03:49.720> than<00:03:50.020> mine<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.280> more

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
smoother than mine and more

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.210 
smoother than mine and more
sophisticated<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.630> had<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.260> kind<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.560> try<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
sophisticated I had to kind of try and

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.770 
sophisticated I had to kind of try and
make<00:03:54.640> sure<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:55.270> know<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.510> didn't<00:03:55.720> sound

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
make sure that you know it didn't sound

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.480 
make sure that you know it didn't sound
like<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:55.990> was<00:03:56.020> hitting<00:03:56.260> puberty<00:03:56.470> every<00:03:56.980> fourth

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
like I was hitting puberty every fourth

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.180 
like I was hitting puberty every fourth
line<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:59.230> know<00:03:59.380> some<00:03:59.620> cracking<00:04:00.010> and

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
line is if you know some cracking and

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.060 
line is if you know some cracking and
stuff<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.460> she<00:04:00.790> doesn't<00:04:00.970> have<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:01.650> for<00:04:02.650> me<00:04:02.830> it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
stuff that she doesn't have so for me it

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.720 
stuff that she doesn't have so for me it
was<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.190> matter<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.520> trying<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.090> keep<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.510> very

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
was a matter of trying to keep it very

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.170 
was a matter of trying to keep it very
smooth<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.000> easy<00:04:08.220> which<00:04:09.220> is<00:04:09.400> not<00:04:09.520> necessarily

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
smooth and easy which is not necessarily

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.870 
smooth and easy which is not necessarily
something<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.930> play<00:04:11.140> all<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.500> time<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:12.790> was

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
something I play all the time so it was

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.680 
something I play all the time so it was
definitely<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.270> different<00:04:13.450> headspace<00:04:13.770> from

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
definitely a different headspace from

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.820 
definitely a different headspace from
some<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.870> other<00:04:16.989> characters<00:04:17.410> I've<00:04:17.560> played

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
some of the other characters I've played

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.610 
some of the other characters I've played
and<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.549> think<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.470> Capcom<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:22.080> don't<00:04:23.080> think

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
and I think that Capcom I don't think

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.950 
and I think that Capcom I don't think
that<00:04:23.800> they<00:04:23.950> wanted<00:04:24.400> someone<00:04:24.880> who<00:04:25.210> was<00:04:25.930> just

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
that they wanted someone who was just

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.360 
that they wanted someone who was just
like<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:27.990> exact<00:04:28.990> voice<00:04:29.260> match<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.590> Sally<00:04:30.250> I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
like a exact voice match for Sally I

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.330 
like a exact voice match for Sally I
felt<00:04:30.760> like<00:04:30.940> they<00:04:31.450> wanted<00:04:31.900> her<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.110> be<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:33.220> know

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
felt like they wanted her to be you know

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.580 
felt like they wanted her to be you know
four<00:04:33.550> ADA's<00:04:33.820> voice<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.330> remain<00:04:34.600> cool<00:04:35.560> and

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
four ADA's voice to remain cool and

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.460 
four ADA's voice to remain cool and
sophisticated<00:04:36.460> but<00:04:36.820> they<00:04:37.150> weren't<00:04:37.390> trying<00:04:38.200> to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
sophisticated but they weren't trying to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.490 
sophisticated but they weren't trying to
make<00:04:38.710> me<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.370> know<00:04:39.540> obviously<00:04:40.540> they<00:04:40.780> would

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
make me you know obviously they would

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.880 
make me you know obviously they would
have<00:04:41.620> used<00:04:42.040> Sally<00:04:42.430> um<00:04:43.020> Capote<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.200> think<00:04:44.620> that

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
have used Sally um Capote I think that

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.670 
have used Sally um Capote I think that
Capcom<00:04:45.610> just<00:04:46.210> wanted<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.630> keep<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.930> spirit<00:04:47.350> of

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
Capcom just wanted to keep the spirit of

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.990 
Capcom just wanted to keep the spirit of
ADA<00:04:49.050> alive<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.800> know<00:04:50.919> in<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> original<00:04:51.790> voice

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
ADA alive you know in the original voice

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.409 
ADA alive you know in the original voice
