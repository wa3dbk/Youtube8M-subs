00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
from your levels now at university you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
from your levels now at university you
spend<00:00:25.800> less<00:00:25.920> time<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.279> lessons<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.390> fact

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
spend less time in lessons it's a fact

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.769 
spend less time in lessons it's a fact
and<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.730> way<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> end<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.300> doing<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> lot<00:00:30.599> more

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and that way you end up doing a lot more

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.130 
and that way you end up doing a lot more
of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> work<00:00:31.910> from<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.030> own<00:00:33.149> initiative<00:00:33.329> so

of the work from your own initiative so
you<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> decide<00:00:34.980> how<00:00:35.219> much<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you have to decide how much time you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.940 
you have to decide how much time you
spend<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.239> things<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:37.230> books<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.710> going

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
level tutors will set you lots of little

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
level tutors will set you lots of little
tasks<00:00:48.270> throughout<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.750> week<00:00:49.070> university

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
tasks throughout the week university

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
tasks throughout the week university
tutors<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.610> set<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> big<00:00:51.239> tasks<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:52.440> very

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
tutors will set you big tasks not very

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
tutors will set you big tasks not very
often<00:00:53.030> mostly<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.969> put<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
often mostly so you do have to put in a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.040 
often mostly so you do have to put in a
lot<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.719> effort<00:00:58.039> at<00:00:59.039> university<00:01:00.050> not

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
lot more effort at university not

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.680 
lot more effort at university not
because<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.710> necessarily<00:01:02.210> more<00:01:03.210> difficult

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
because it's necessarily more difficult

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
because it's necessarily more difficult
academically<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.820> quite<00:01:05.820> often<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.720> if

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
academically which quite often it is if

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
academically which quite often it is if
it's<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.560> step<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.729> also<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it's a step up but also because you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's a step up but also because you
don't<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:10.170> someone<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.650> telling<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
don't have someone there telling you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.289 
don't have someone there telling you
exactly<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.970> level

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
exactly what to do so in a way a level

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.350 
exactly what to do so in a way a level
is<00:01:15.390> quite<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> good<00:01:16.020> midway<00:01:16.619> between<00:01:17.090> GCSE<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
is quite a good midway between GCSE and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
is quite a good midway between GCSE and
university<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.140> each<00:01:19.650> one's<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> step<00:01:20.220> up

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
university because each one's a step up

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.630 
university because each one's a step up
each<00:01:20.700> each<00:01:21.180> time<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.900> step<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.350> level<00:01:22.640> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
each each time you step up a level you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.719 
each each time you step up a level you
get<00:01:24.420> spoon-fed<00:01:25.049> slightly<00:01:25.619> less<00:01:25.799> i<00:01:26.040> mean<00:01:26.189> GCSE

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
get spoon-fed slightly less i mean GCSE

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
get spoon-fed slightly less i mean GCSE
they<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:26.939> tell<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.420> exactly<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> read

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
they do tell you exactly what to read

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
they do tell you exactly what to read
and<00:01:28.619> quite<00:01:29.280> often<00:01:29.460> they'll<00:01:29.759> tell<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> exactly

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and quite often they'll tell you exactly

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.870 
and quite often they'll tell you exactly
what<00:01:30.600> things<00:01:30.810> mean<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.430> level<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
what things mean a level you get that a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.480 
what things mean a level you get that a
little<00:01:33.119> bit<00:01:33.240> less<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.689> university<00:01:34.490> they

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
little bit less and at university they

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.210 
little bit less and at university they
do<00:01:35.549> step<00:01:35.909> back<00:01:36.090> even<00:01:36.390> more<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:38.040> really

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
do step back even more so it's really

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.140 
do step back even more so it's really
good<00:01:38.400> practice<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:40.460> try<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.579> schedule<00:01:41.939> your

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
good practice to try and schedule your

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
good practice to try and schedule your
study<00:01:42.450> leave<00:01:42.720> around<00:01:43.530> exactly<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.130> want

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
study leave around exactly what you want

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
study leave around exactly what you want
to<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> good<00:01:45.689> preparation<00:01:45.960> for

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to do and that is good preparation for

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.649 
to do and that is good preparation for
how<00:01:47.250> you're<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.640> cope<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:47.970> university

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
how you're going to cope at university

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
how you're going to cope at university
so<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.890> quite<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.340> time<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.729> at

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
so if you get quite a lot of time off at
