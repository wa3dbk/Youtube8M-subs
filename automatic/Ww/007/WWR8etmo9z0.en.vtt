from<00:02:03.509> 150<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.619> eight<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
from 150 and this was on eight but I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
from 150 and this was on eight but I
don't<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.960> check<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
don't know if it's just if I check the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.510 
don't know if it's just if I check the
check<00:02:08.670> there

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
check there

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.640 
check there
the<00:02:09.700> check<00:02:09.910> mark<00:02:10.150> there<00:02:10.180> then<00:02:11.170> it'll<00:02:11.590> go

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the check mark there then it'll go

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.320 
the check mark there then it'll go
maximum<00:02:14.650> foreground<00:02:15.010> FES<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.000> maximum

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
maximum foreground FES and maximum

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.120 
maximum foreground FES and maximum
background<00:02:16.630> FPS<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.170> really<00:02:17.350> matter<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.740> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
background FPS is really matter what the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.830 
background FPS is really matter what the
sliders<00:02:18.520> are<00:02:18.640> doing<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.600> what<00:02:19.750> it

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
sliders are doing but this is what it

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.030 
sliders are doing but this is what it
was<00:02:19.900> at<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> beginning<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.830> I'm<00:02:20.920> just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
was at in the beginning so I'm just

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.980 
was at in the beginning so I'm just
going<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.220> do<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.730> was<00:02:22.540> seeing<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.810> lot<00:02:22.960> of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
going to do that I was seeing a lot of

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.110 
going to do that I was seeing a lot of
lag<00:02:23.770> right<00:02:23.800> there<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.280> i<00:02:24.340> don't<00:02:24.520> know<00:02:24.580> if<00:02:24.610> it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
lag right there so i don't know if it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.100 
lag right there so i don't know if it's
just<00:02:25.480> bug<00:02:25.750> year<00:02:26.050> what<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:28.210> next<00:02:28.510> thing<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.990> was

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
just bug year what the next thing I was

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.250 
just bug year what the next thing I was
going<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.410> was<00:02:31.080> take<00:02:32.080> off<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:33.180> tutorials

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
going to do was take off the tutorials

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.890 
going to do was take off the tutorials
and<00:02:35.260> then<00:02:35.850> from<00:02:36.850> there<00:02:37.090> we'll<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.510> go<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
and then from there we'll just go and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780 
and then from there we'll just go and
this<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.620> new<00:02:38.770> interface<00:02:39.100> by<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.490> way<00:02:39.640> if

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
this is a new interface by the way if

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
this is a new interface by the way if
you<00:02:39.880> want<00:02:40.000> if<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.240> wanted<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.600> check<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.900> out

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.470 

alright<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.610> new<00:02:48.730> interface<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.330> this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
alright so the new interface for this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.530 
alright so the new interface for this
skill<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.230> there<00:02:50.470> too<00:02:50.970> if<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.090> wanted<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.390> see

friends in game um if you guys noticed
the<00:03:33.970> zombies<00:03:34.330> were<00:03:34.480> actually<00:03:34.840> different

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the zombies were actually different

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.369 
the zombies were actually different
sizes<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.720> there's<00:03:37.720> something<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.049> you<00:03:38.230> can

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
sizes and there's something that you can

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.100 
sizes and there's something that you can
do<00:03:38.530> with<00:03:38.799> game<00:03:39.280> interfaces<00:03:39.819> were<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:41.019> know

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
do with game interfaces were you know

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.190 
do with game interfaces were you know
any<00:03:41.319> zombie<00:03:42.069> spawn<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.549> just<00:03:42.730> spawn<00:03:42.940> randomly

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
any zombie spawn so just spawn randomly

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.720 
any zombie spawn so just spawn randomly
larger<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.349> smaller<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.430> want<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.640> check

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
larger and smaller if you want to check

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.280 
larger and smaller if you want to check
out<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:45.970> body<00:03:46.150> sizes<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.780> these<00:03:46.900> zombies

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.280 
out the body sizes of these zombies
they're<00:03:47.799> different<00:03:48.099> sizes<00:03:48.160> here<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:50.079> get<00:03:50.200> it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
they're different sizes here you get it

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.199 
they're different sizes here you get it
at<00:03:50.440> or<00:03:50.620> I'm<00:03:50.709> just<00:03:50.739> however<00:03:51.159> I<00:03:51.370> don't<00:03:51.519> know<00:03:51.700> but

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
at or I'm just however I don't know but

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.780 
at or I'm just however I don't know but
you<00:03:53.170> tell<00:03:53.349> me<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.650> think<00:03:54.190> there<00:03:54.370> are<00:03:54.400> different

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
you tell me I think there are different

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.630 
you tell me I think there are different
sizes<00:03:54.910> there<00:03:55.299> because<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.660> saw<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.290> visual

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
sizes there because I saw like a visual

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.300 
sizes there because I saw like a visual
difference<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:58.269> sizes<00:03:58.690> they<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.950> tell<00:04:00.160> me

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
difference in the sizes they you tell me

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.830 
difference in the sizes they you tell me
what<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:00.700> think<00:04:01.319> pretty<00:04:02.319> sure<00:04:02.650> though<00:04:03.299> but<00:04:04.299> I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
what you think pretty sure though but I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.759 
what you think pretty sure though but I
don't<00:04:05.170> know<00:04:05.230> if<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.410> was<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.650> patch

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
don't know if that was in the patch

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.650 
don't know if that was in the patch
notes<00:04:05.799> or<00:04:06.099> not<00:04:06.220> but<00:04:06.790> we'll<00:04:07.510> see<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:10.030> for<00:04:10.569> the
