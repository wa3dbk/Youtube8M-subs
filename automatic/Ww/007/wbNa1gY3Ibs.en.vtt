00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello good afternoon the show is a mix 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 of music and dance and promises to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.750
 of all ages with messages 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 of love and respect for the elders I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.690
 I now talk to the artistic director. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 of the show 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 jesus motard milestones marcos esse 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.279
 show is based on a classic 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.039
 international literature is not good afternoon 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.800
 that it is based on the poems of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 tomas elliot is a fantastic thing and if 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 North American has been able to fascinate 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 world through 15 poems that I think 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.530
 that at the time of writing he would be 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 very silly and the truth has gained this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.000
 proportion because they are cats that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 represent human personalities 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.989
 so when you go to the theater to watch 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 this text enchants you because you 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 identifies with each of them 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
 now most of the actors involved 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.620
 that this show are from right here 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.840
 of alagoas is not intentional this is the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 our greatest pride to have made a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.940
 innovation here in the theater make a musical 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.060
 with people here not only the actors 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 dance dancers who are trained 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 by the university duly 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 them but the technicians involved all 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.540
 they are also even Alagoas 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.070
 dressmaker who needed to do the costume 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 the makeup artist who had to do this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 bright makeup all of them for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.689
 our pride the Alagoas were eight 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.140
 months of daily trials with five 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.090
 six hours per day of testing is 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 awesome but we did it on account 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.560
 every day in the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.900
 meeting every day with this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.570

 through our daily commitment to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.220
 Our expectation is very good in this 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.649
 premiere we already have there will be our house 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 it already brings us good energy and 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.250
 after the Alagoan public he 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.469
 waited a lot for a moment like this 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.869
 It's a victory for all of us. 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.149
 we are excited about this project and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.659
 that the public can expect this time to 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.750
 presentation is an art that mixes 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.240
 all is not theater music tap dance 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.790

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.040

 magic has time the show 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.310
 It's amazing, I saw them on their faces at 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.560
 Sometimes doing it is because of the effects 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.130
 that we seek to bring to what he teaches 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.030
 so expect a musical with standard 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:47.410
