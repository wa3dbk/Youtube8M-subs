00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's just nice and obviously it was

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
that's just nice and obviously it was
nicer<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.370> parked<00:00:56.670> 15<00:00:57.030> years<00:00:57.270> ago

you<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> wonder<00:00:58.710> why<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.430> quit

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you have to wonder why did they quit

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.889 
you have to wonder why did they quit
driving<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.090> why<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.359> anybody<00:01:00.539> quit

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
driving it why would anybody quit

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
driving it why would anybody quit
driving<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.260> car<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.039> when<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.730> went

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
driving a car like this now when we went

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.289 
driving a car like this now when we went
to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> house<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.510> first<00:01:03.750> fired<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> up

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
to the house and we first fired it up

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.609 
to the house and we first fired it up
well<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> missed<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> kind

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
well it missed a little bit but I kind

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.660 
well it missed a little bit but I kind
of<00:01:07.650> thought<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.159> from<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> sitting

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
of thought that was just from it sitting

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.280 
of thought that was just from it sitting
a<00:01:08.760> long<00:01:08.880> time<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:11.479> when<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> started<00:01:13.049> seeming

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
a long time but when it started seeming

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
a long time but when it started seeming
like<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.710> more<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.220> than<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
like there was more to it than that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.510 
like there was more to it than that
realized<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
realized that if some kind of a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.249 
realized that if some kind of a
mechanical<00:01:18.060> problem<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.869> why<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.140> quit

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
mechanical problem that's why they quit

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
mechanical problem that's why they quit
driving<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.000> obviously<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.180> had

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
driving it and obviously they had

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.789 
driving it and obviously they had
discovered<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> had<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.290> blown<00:01:22.530> head

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
discovered that it had that blown head

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
discovered that it had that blown head
gasket<00:01:22.830> probably<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> long<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.180> ago<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
gasket probably a long time ago and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.179 
gasket probably a long time ago and
that's<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.380> took<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.710> road

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that's what took it off the road

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
that's what took it off the road
why<00:01:26.640> else<00:01:26.820> would<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.000> stop<00:01:27.240> driving<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> car

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
why else would you stop driving a car

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
why else would you stop driving a car
like<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.759> let's<00:01:29.759> fix<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> getting<00:01:30.150> driven<00:01:30.390> a
