00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.170
 will be 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.879
 and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.620
 hi friends today we have the third video 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.260
 about the moleb anomalous zone or 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 Moleb's triangles we also 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.399
 continue to consider 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.860
 anomalies of the major triangle and on 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.680
 queues we have an anomalous zone under 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.829
 name cosmodrome before cosmodrome 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 wrongly called and central glade and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.440
 settlements and many other places on the very 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 business spaceport is the old river bed 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.649
 again located below the snake hill 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.380
 the place is unusual and gloomy surrounded 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.530
 from all sides and with this shore forms 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.800
 a small gorge overgrown and slightly 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.869
 swampy is this place still 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.810
 details unexplored therefore 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.090
 firstly because of its inaccessibility 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.190
 and secondly the lack of detailed 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.340
 information about its location 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.649
 surprisingly but detailed maps 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.929
 ufologists began to use only 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.569
 recently and without a map find it very 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.479
 difficult supposedly in this place could 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.390
 military facility 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.610
 buhoro then got up instead of being on 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.670
 the bank of the Sylvah near the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.830
 campsites and campgrounds from the standpoint 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.410
 named for journalists by you 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.690
 Good that in the article Moleb 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.479
 triangle or strangers don't walk here 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.479
 wrote contact with phosphorescent 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.149
 silhouettes in this place next 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.360
 the anomalous zone is a black river 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.769
 it is located near the spaceport 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.870
 characterized by the presence of chrono 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.410
 abnormal phenomena has a reputation 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.090
 prodigal places and last anomalous 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.129
 we have a white mountain zone 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.950
 photo of the war years that was built 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.160
 camp for political prisoners so far 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.550
 preserved foundation of the building 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.310
 the remains of the power-saw bench we can shut up 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 rusted barbed wire snacks 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.320
 unusual phenomena observed 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.590
 flashing sparks at a height of about 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.000
 one and a half meters from the ground 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.820
 unexpectedly on 2000 countries into the forest and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.330
 icy wind during absolute calm 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.330
 and balls
