00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.400 

we<00:01:11.960> have<00:01:12.110> years<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.500> policing<00:01:12.920> our<00:01:13.210> solution

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
we have years of policing our solution

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.130 
we have years of policing our solution
to<00:01:15.410> helping<00:01:15.890> dogs<00:01:16.100> with<00:01:16.700> any<00:01:17.540> problem<00:01:18.050> that

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
to helping dogs with any problem that

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.050 
to helping dogs with any problem that
they<00:01:18.260> have<00:01:18.410> specifically<00:01:19.070> resource<00:01:19.820> guarding

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
they have specifically resource guarding

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.480 
they have specifically resource guarding
possessive<00:01:21.070> possessive<00:01:22.070> aggressive

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
possessive possessive aggressive

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.120 
possessive possessive aggressive
behavior<00:01:22.910> is<00:01:23.330> not<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:24.350> take<00:01:24.590> away<00:01:24.650> their

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
behavior is not to take away their

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.340 
behavior is not to take away their
things<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.760> they<00:01:25.940> struggle<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:26.600> but

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
things that they struggle with but

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.780 
things that they struggle with but
actually<00:01:27.740> teach<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:28.250> how<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.400> cope<00:01:28.760> with

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
actually teach and how to cope with

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.730 
actually teach and how to cope with
exhibit<00:01:29.390> shuffle<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:29.900> my<00:01:30.050> solution<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.590> not

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
exhibit shuffle so my solution is not

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.440 
exhibit shuffle so my solution is not
going<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.920> say<00:01:31.040> keep<00:01:31.580> your<00:01:31.760> dog<00:01:31.940> away<00:01:32.090> from
