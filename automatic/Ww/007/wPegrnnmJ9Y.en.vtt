00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
road to the XF is very good indeed we

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.280 
road to the XF is very good indeed we
should<00:02:30.209> have<00:02:30.330> been<00:02:30.420> ready<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.930> really

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
should have been ready for this really

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
should have been ready for this really
because<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.709> XF<00:02:32.130> was<00:02:32.370> always<00:02:32.670> very<00:02:32.819> good<00:02:33.150> but

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
because the XF was always very good but

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.600 
because the XF was always very good but
one<00:02:33.510> criticism<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.680> old<00:02:34.830> car<00:02:35.130> was

one criticism of that the old car was

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.640 
one criticism of that the old car was
the<00:02:35.760> fact<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.450> rode<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.470> too

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the fact that it rode a little bit too

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.620 
the fact that it rode a little bit too
badly<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:38.819> change<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.420> one

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
badly it's all change for this one

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.039 
badly it's all change for this one
though

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
though

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.979 
though
just<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.280> XE<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.940> suspension<00:02:42.569> setting

just like the XE the suspension setting

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.220 
just like the XE the suspension setting
is<00:02:43.200> very<00:02:43.500> soft<00:02:43.860> indeed<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:44.819> unlikely<00:02:45.360> XE<00:02:45.900> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
suspension the steering is very good as

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.729 
suspension the steering is very good as
well<00:03:07.519> much<00:03:08.519> like<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:09.120> XE<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.750> full<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.380> feel

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
well much like the XE it's full of feel

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.069 
well much like the XE it's full of feel
but<00:03:11.040> unlikely<00:03:11.489> XE<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.570> has<00:03:12.690> got<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> lot<00:03:13.019> of

but unlikely XE this has got a lot of
weight<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:14.070> nice<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.609> meaty<00:03:14.880> is

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
weight to it so it's nice and meaty is

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.539 
weight to it so it's nice and meaty is
it<00:03:15.870> as<00:03:15.989> good<00:03:16.049> as<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.350> BMW<00:03:16.829> 5-series

horsepower 470 Newton meters of torque
and<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:06.010> really<00:04:06.370> does<00:04:06.730> shift<00:04:07.440> nought<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.620> 60

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
and it really does shift nought to 60

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.759 
and it really does shift nought to 60
takes<00:04:09.280> about<00:04:09.489> five<00:04:10.030> seconds<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.319> this<00:04:11.530> type<00:04:11.739> of

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
takes about five seconds so this type of

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.619 
takes about five seconds so this type of
car<00:04:12.129> really<00:04:12.849> is<00:04:13.120> going<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.390> be<00:04:13.510> the

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
car really is going to be the

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.710 
car really is going to be the
performance<00:04:14.260> model<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.280> XF<00:04:15.790> range<00:04:16.150> until

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
performance model of the XF range until

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.539 
performance model of the XF range until
possibly<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.380> hotter<00:04:17.650> model<00:04:18.010> comes<00:04:18.220> along<00:04:18.459> in

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
possibly a hotter model comes along in

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.640 
possibly a hotter model comes along in
the<00:04:18.609> next<00:04:18.850> couple<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.180> years<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> best

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
the next couple of years but the best

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.680 
the next couple of years but the best
thing<00:04:20.889> about<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.250> car<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.850> way<00:04:22.330> it

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
thing about this car is the way it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.710 
thing about this car is the way it
steers<00:04:23.380> now<00:04:24.160> we<00:04:24.729> discovered<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.539> road

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
steers now we discovered it on the road

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.830 
steers now we discovered it on the road
earlier<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.320> but<00:04:26.470> this<00:04:26.620> car<00:04:26.919> has<00:04:27.160> got<00:04:27.880> pinpoint

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
earlier on but this car has got pinpoint

earlier on but this car has got pinpoint
sharp<00:04:29.260> steering<00:04:30.039> you<00:04:30.430> turn<00:04:30.729> into<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.060> corner

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
sharp steering you turn into a corner

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.719 
sharp steering you turn into a corner
and<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> front<00:04:32.139> end<00:04:32.350> dives<00:04:32.919> straight<00:04:33.400> into

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
class really a 5 Series is very good but

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.000 
class really a 5 Series is very good but
this<00:04:39.639> is<00:04:39.880> quite<00:04:40.210> possibly<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.560> little<00:04:41.860> bit

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
this is quite possibly just a little bit

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.540 
this is quite possibly just a little bit
better<00:04:42.720> negatives<00:04:43.720> well<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.710> pedals<00:04:45.400> are<00:04:45.520> a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
better negatives well the pedals are a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.640 
better negatives well the pedals are a
little<00:04:45.699> bit<00:04:45.940> offset<00:04:46.090> for<00:04:46.600> my<00:04:46.720> liking<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.260> the

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
little bit offset for my liking and the

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.920 
little bit offset for my liking and the
brake<00:04:47.860> pedal<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.340> little<00:04:48.610> bit<00:04:48.820> spongy<00:04:49.180> but

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
brake pedal is a little bit spongy but

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.070

overall<00:04:50.289> it's<00:04:51.280> very<00:04:51.760> very<00:04:52.180> good<00:04:52.270> indeed<00:04:52.780> i

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
overall it's very very good indeed i
