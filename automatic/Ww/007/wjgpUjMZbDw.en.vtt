00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
the moment my reading is kind of based

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.990 
the moment my reading is kind of based
on<00:04:31.710> what<00:04:31.800> i<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:32.039> find<00:04:32.189> at<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.430> library<00:04:32.789> or

what i can find in charity books and
secondhand<00:04:35.909> bookshops<00:04:36.330> which<00:04:36.659> I've<00:04:37.020> kind<00:04:37.379> of

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
secondhand bookshops which I've kind of

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.929 
secondhand bookshops which I've kind of
decided<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:38.009> actually<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.430> good<00:04:38.669> thing<00:04:38.729> because

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 
decided is actually a good thing because

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.149 
decided is actually a good thing because
this<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.629> kind<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.960> making<00:04:40.139> me<00:04:40.379> branch<00:04:40.680> out<00:04:40.889> to

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
this is kind of making me branch out to

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.100 
this is kind of making me branch out to
areas<00:04:41.819> that<00:04:41.849> I<00:04:42.030> don't<00:04:42.479> normally<00:04:42.599> read<00:04:42.870> about

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.369 
I'm reading at the moment and I'm kind
of<00:05:03.000> hoping<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.509> it's<00:05:03.659> gonna<00:05:03.750> stay<00:05:04.020> like<00:05:04.169> that

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
of hoping that it's gonna stay like that

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.760 
of hoping that it's gonna stay like that
while<00:05:05.039> I<00:05:05.400> have<00:05:05.729> loved<00:05:06.180> young<00:05:06.719> adult<00:05:07.050> so<00:05:07.440> much

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
while I have loved young adult so much

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.450 
while I have loved young adult so much
in<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.129> genre<00:05:08.159> has<00:05:09.259> literally<00:05:10.259> shaped<00:05:10.830> me<00:05:11.250> as

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
in the genre has literally shaped me as

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.089 
in the genre has literally shaped me as
a<00:05:11.550> person<00:05:11.909> to<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.780> degree<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.379> would<00:05:13.710> not

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
a person to the degree that I would not

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.680 
a person to the degree that I would not
at<00:05:14.580> all<00:05:15.060> be<00:05:15.500> however<00:05:17.000> whatever<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.330> come<00:05:18.599> across

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
at all be however whatever I come across

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.559 
at all be however whatever I come across
as<00:05:19.169> I<00:05:19.409> would<00:05:19.650> not<00:05:19.830> be<00:05:20.099> that<00:05:20.310> without<00:05:20.610> ye<00:05:20.849> but<00:05:21.360> so

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
as I would not be that without ye but so

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.149 
as I would not be that without ye but so
now<00:05:21.719> I<00:05:21.750> think<00:05:21.930> it's<00:05:22.169> time<00:05:22.319> for<00:05:22.500> me<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.949> really

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
now I think it's time for me to really

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.339 
now I think it's time for me to really
try<00:05:23.520> and<00:05:23.669> stretch<00:05:23.940> out<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> lot<00:05:24.419> more<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:24.870> read

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
try and stretch out a lot more and read

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:26.570 
try and stretch out a lot more and read
all<00:05:25.560> those<00:05:25.680> classic<00:05:26.159> books<00:05:26.340> I've<00:05:26.550> been

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
meaning to and really start back on the

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.459 
meaning to and really start back on the
poetry<00:05:29.490> I'm<00:05:30.029> really<00:05:30.270> hoping<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.229> still
