The players of "Quick Change" will
be Daniel, Luque and Anderson.

00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:07.644
They will make a scene,
and whenever I say 'change',

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:10.674
they will have to change the
last thing they have said or done.

00:00:10.674 --> 00:00:14.368
I'd like for you to give us
an object for us to start.

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.583
Cup... Pocket knife!

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:23.127
'Pocket knife' is the object that
will start "Quick Change", go!

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:32.282
Sir, you have to step back, take out all
the metal objects from your front pocket,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.248
from the back pocket, if you have
any metal objects in your sneakers

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:37.174
- you must remove them too...
- Change!

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:39.852
- If you have any metal objects in
your shoes, you must... - Change!

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:43.351
If you like heavy metal,
you can't get in.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.520
- No, I'm good...
- You're more of a country man?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.061
- Yes, I am.
- All right, you can try again.

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:52.277
Can you please go faster? I'm on a
hurry, my plane is about to leave...

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.221
Change the noise!

00:00:58.586 --> 00:00:59.813
Change!

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:07.482

we can't have that... - The Lion King...

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:16.486

country singer, I have 5 million tweets!

00:01:16.486 --> 00:01:18.419
- It's him!
- The country man!

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:20.743

00:01:58.512 --> 00:02:01.234
- Thank you, thank you!
- You're free to pass!

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:04.580
What nobody knew, is that in

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.399
- who once had a fine career,
hijacked the plane! - Change!

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.937
- That artist wanted to kill one of
the passengers. - Change!

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:16.559
That artist wanted
to kill his partner,

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.962
so he could have a solo career!

00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:24.016
- Attention, passenger Roberto Augusto...
- Howdy, partner!

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:27.576
Your partner wants to kill you,
please attend to the cockpit!

00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:31.410

want to kill me! - No...

And stabbed the flight attendant!

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:02.255
My God, what are you doing?

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:04.747

- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Are you the pilot?

00:03:58.323 --> 00:04:01.024
Yes, it's me. Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the pilot speaking.

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:05.586

fight, we are now at 10,000 feet

00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:11.336

00:04:25.485 --> 00:04:29.197
Dude, there's so much
room between the seats!

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:31.304
- So?

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.614

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:36.967
- They're trying ta kill us!
- Oh, yeah! They're trying ta kill us!

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:38.592

Elidio, how did it feel to spend
half of the scene getting beaten?

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.366
