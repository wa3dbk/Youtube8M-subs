00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.260 
instead of experiencing things and most
games<00:04:11.820> these<00:04:12.240> days<00:04:12.300> are<00:04:13.190> kind<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.340> violent<00:04:14.700> you

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
games these days are kind of violent you

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.520 
games these days are kind of violent you
know<00:04:15.420> so<00:04:15.690> then<00:04:15.840> they're<00:04:15.990> seeing<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.470> now

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
know so then they're seeing that now

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.680 
know so then they're seeing that now
that<00:04:16.829> they<00:04:16.890> don't<00:04:17.040> see<00:04:17.220> on<00:04:17.370> TV<00:04:17.730> but<00:04:18.030> they<00:04:18.630> see

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
that they don't see on TV but they see

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.070 
that they don't see on TV but they see
it<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.169> computer<00:04:20.070> games<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.910> video<00:04:21.209> games<00:04:21.450> and

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
it in computer games and video games and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.750 
it in computer games and video games and
stuff<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.950> think<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.370> it's

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
stuff like that so I think it's it's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.490 
stuff like that so I think it's it's
better<00:04:24.300> especially<00:04:24.630> for<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.080> younger<00:04:25.230> kids

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
better especially for the younger kids

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.070 
better especially for the younger kids
to<00:04:25.710> get<00:04:25.830> back<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:27.300> old<00:04:27.510> fashioned<00:04:28.050> way

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
to get back to the the old fashioned way

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.100 
to get back to the the old fashioned way
I<00:04:28.230> guess<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:28.740> what<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:29.040> would<00:04:29.160> call<00:04:29.340> it
