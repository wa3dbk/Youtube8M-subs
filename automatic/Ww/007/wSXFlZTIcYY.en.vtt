what you see any fresher out of them

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.020 
what you see any fresher out of them
yeah<00:01:51.590> no<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:51.830> think<00:01:51.950> it's<00:01:52.250> good<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.549> know<00:01:52.670> I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
yeah no I think it's good you know I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.570 
yeah no I think it's good you know I
think<00:01:53.299> there's<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.479> lot<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.630> plays<00:01:53.990> where<00:01:54.580> you

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
think there's a lot of plays where you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.859 
think there's a lot of plays where you
know<00:01:55.700> they<00:01:56.000> would<00:01:56.150> argue<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.450> there<00:01:56.720> was<00:01:56.840> a

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
know they would argue that there was a

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.539 
know they would argue that there was a
sack<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.229> things<00:01:57.650> like<00:01:57.830> that<00:01:57.890> but<00:01:58.070> we<00:01:58.310> let<00:01:58.460> it

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
sack and things like that but we let it

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.010 
sack and things like that but we let it
go<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.940> we<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.180> see<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.600> ball<00:01:59.750> would<00:01:59.869> be

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
go so we can see if the ball would be

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.210 
go so we can see if the ball would be
defended<00:02:00.470> down<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.740> field<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.960> again

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
defended down the field and so again

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.380 
defended down the field and so again
we'll<00:02:04.220> learn<00:02:04.340> again<00:02:04.729> we<00:02:04.970> learned<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> lot<00:02:05.330> here

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
we'll learn again we learned a lot here

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.150 
we'll learn again we learned a lot here
I<00:02:07.209> would<00:02:08.209> say<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.289> everybody<00:02:09.649> took<00:02:09.860> probably

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
I would say and everybody took probably

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.110 
I would say and everybody took probably
between<00:02:10.970> 35<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.630> 45<00:02:12.080> reps<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.670> ones<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.060> twos

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
between 35 and 45 reps the ones and twos

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.400 
between 35 and 45 reps the ones and twos
so<00:02:14.920> again<00:02:15.920> probably<00:02:16.220> know<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.880> half<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.209> game

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
so again probably know in half a game

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.660 
so again probably know in half a game

greedy<00:02:59.930> disruptive<00:03:00.920> his<00:03:01.040> Quan<00:03:01.310> now<00:03:01.520> compared

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
greedy disruptive his Quan now compared

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
greedy disruptive his Quan now compared
to<00:03:02.120> his<00:03:02.210> freshman<00:03:02.660> year<00:03:02.690> practices<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.740> what

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
to his freshman year practices and what

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.200 
to his freshman year practices and what
sort<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.220> growth<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.670> seen<00:03:04.880> well<00:03:05.180> I

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
sort of growth have you seen well I

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.670 
sort of growth have you seen well I
think<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.570> biggest<00:03:05.780> growth<00:03:06.080> with<00:03:06.320> him<00:03:06.500> right

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
think the biggest growth with him right

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.330 
think the biggest growth with him right
now<00:03:06.710> is<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.340> uh<00:03:08.560> he<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:09.650> studying<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.160> game

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
now is that uh he was studying the game

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.070 
now is that uh he was studying the game
he's<00:03:10.550> not<00:03:10.580> making<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.150> many<00:03:11.270> in<00:03:11.510> mental<00:03:11.810> errors

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
he's not making as many in mental errors

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.490 
he's not making as many in mental errors
as<00:03:12.560> opposed<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.870> relying<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.380> his

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
as opposed to just just relying on his

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.080 
as opposed to just just relying on his
talent<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.010> think<00:03:16.250> he's<00:03:16.370> matured<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:16.970> that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
talent I think he's matured in that

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.630 
talent I think he's matured in that
respect<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.680> then<00:03:18.830> he's<00:03:18.950> got<00:03:19.100> little<00:03:19.220> weapons

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
respect and then he's got little weapons

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.600 
respect and then he's got little weapons
now<00:03:19.790> he's<00:03:19.970> stronger<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:22.190> if<00:03:22.250> he<00:03:22.340> wants<00:03:22.550> to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
now he's stronger so if he wants to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.160 
now he's stronger so if he wants to
power<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:23.060> back<00:03:23.240> he<00:03:23.450> can<00:03:23.600> power<00:03:23.810> your<00:03:23.870> back

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
power you back he can power your back

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.860 
power you back he can power your back
and<00:03:24.640> he's<00:03:25.640> explosive<00:03:26.060> he<00:03:26.330> still<00:03:26.540> has<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> great

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
and he's explosive he still has a great

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.199 
and he's explosive he still has a great
motor<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.560> know<00:03:27.739> he's<00:03:27.890> gained<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.970> know<00:03:29.060> he

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
spring and also just maybe some

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.860 
spring and also just maybe some
differences<00:03:40.100> from

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
differences from

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.240 
differences from
well<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.470> mean<00:03:41.709> he's<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:42.010> leader<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.549> mean<00:03:42.790> he's<00:03:42.970> uh

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
well I mean he's a leader I mean he's uh

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.180 
well I mean he's a leader I mean he's uh
no<00:03:45.500> it's<00:03:46.500> difference<00:03:46.770> between<00:03:46.950> being<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
no it's difference between being the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.000

he's<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> leader<00:03:52.710> he's<00:03:52.800> very<00:03:53.100> comfortable<00:03:53.520> in

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
he's a leader he's very comfortable in

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.630 
he's a leader he's very comfortable in
his<00:03:53.700> skin<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:57.630> know<00:03:57.690> he's<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:57.930> imposing

his will on things a little bit more and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.699 
his will on things a little bit more and
