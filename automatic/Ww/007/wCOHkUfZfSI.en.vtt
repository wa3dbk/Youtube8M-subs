summer so that you have to eat again and
then<00:01:37.369> eat<00:01:37.490> another<00:01:37.789> tiny<00:01:38.030> meal<00:01:38.240> that's<00:01:38.509> not

then eat another tiny meal that's not

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:39.969 
then eat another tiny meal that's not
dieting<00:01:39.049> that's<00:01:39.200> called<00:01:39.380> crash<00:01:39.590> dieting

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
dieting that's called crash dieting

that's not healthy that's very bad for

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.240 
that's not healthy that's very bad for
your<00:01:41.600> body<00:01:41.780> you're<00:01:42.439> actually<00:01:42.920> not<00:01:43.070> going<00:01:43.189> to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
your body you're actually not going to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.469 
your body you're actually not going to
lose<00:01:43.340> weight<00:01:43.549> either<00:01:43.700> you'll<00:01:44.270> gain<00:01:44.420> weight

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
lose weight either you'll gain weight

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.120 
lose weight either you'll gain weight
because<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.439> might<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.710> able<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.890> stick<00:01:46.039> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
because you might be able to stick to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.560 
because you might be able to stick to
that<00:01:46.250> plan<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.670> about<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.850> day<00:01:47.060> maybe<00:01:47.299> two<00:01:47.539> days

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
that plan for about a day maybe two days

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.969 
that plan for about a day maybe two days
then<00:01:48.109> all<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.289> sudden<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.469> going<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.680> crash

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
then all the sudden you going to crash

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.590 
then all the sudden you going to crash
and<00:01:49.490> you're<00:01:49.579> going<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.729> eat<00:01:49.850> ten<00:01:50.149> times<00:01:50.359> more

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
and you're going to eat ten times more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.300 
and you're going to eat ten times more
than<00:01:50.780> you've<00:01:50.899> ever<00:01:51.020> eaten<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:51.740> that's<00:01:52.130> not<00:01:52.250> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
than you've ever eaten so that's not a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.310 
than you've ever eaten so that's not a
good<00:01:52.460> thing

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
good thing

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.470 
good thing
first<00:01:54.920> I'm<00:01:55.040> gonna<00:01:55.130> talk<00:01:55.280> about<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
first I'm gonna talk about is the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.940 
first I'm gonna talk about is the
different<00:01:56.810> types<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.170> protein<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.740> first

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
different types of protein the first

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.710 
different types of protein the first
being<00:01:58.250> obviously<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.850> wave<00:01:59.030> protein<00:01:59.540> that's

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
being obviously is wave protein that's

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.320 
being obviously is wave protein that's
your<00:01:59.870> most<00:02:00.020> popular<00:02:00.230> protein<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.160> great<00:02:01.700> muscle

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
your most popular protein a great muscle

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.630 
your most popular protein a great muscle
building<00:02:02.600> protein<00:02:03.050> they<00:02:03.680> really<00:02:04.280> consider

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
building protein they really consider

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.760 
building protein they really consider
this<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:05.030> fast-acting<00:02:05.600> protein<00:02:06.230> just<00:02:06.410> because

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
this a fast-acting protein just because

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.100 
this a fast-acting protein just because
your<00:02:07.010> body<00:02:07.220> can't<00:02:07.610> digest<00:02:07.730> it<00:02:08.150> and<00:02:08.330> transport

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
your body can't digest it and transport

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.930 
your body can't digest it and transport
it<00:02:09.260> to<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.710> muscle<00:02:09.980> the<00:02:10.160> quickest<00:02:10.490> second

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
it to the muscle the quickest second

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.640 
it to the muscle the quickest second
type<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.090> protein<00:02:11.600> I'm<00:02:11.840> gonna<00:02:11.990> talk<00:02:12.110> about<00:02:12.230> is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
type of protein I'm gonna talk about is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.340 
type of protein I'm gonna talk about is
called<00:02:12.920> casein<00:02:13.160> protein<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> slow

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
called casein protein it's really a slow

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.230 
called casein protein it's really a slow
releasing<00:02:15.770> slow<00:02:16.250> acting<00:02:16.520> protein<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.180> a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
releasing slow acting protein it's a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.490 
releasing slow acting protein it's a
protein<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.630> can<00:02:17.750> drink<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.050> morning<00:02:18.350> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
protein you can drink in the morning and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.840 
protein you can drink in the morning and
it<00:02:18.590> will<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.040> will<00:02:19.190> release<00:02:19.430> yourself

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
it will it will release yourself

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.980 
it will it will release yourself
throughout<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.360> day<00:02:20.510> kind<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:20.960> a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
throughout the day kind of like a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.540 
throughout the day kind of like a
time-release<00:02:21.530> allergy<00:02:21.950> pill<00:02:22.130> something<00:02:22.430> like

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
time-release allergy pill something like

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.300 
time-release allergy pill something like
that<00:02:22.760> casein<00:02:23.210> protein<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.110> great<00:02:24.410> protein

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that casein protein is a great protein

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.890 
that casein protein is a great protein
to<00:02:25.370> drink<00:02:25.580> at<00:02:25.670> night<00:02:25.700> time<00:02:26.060> because<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.810> will

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
to drink at night time because it will

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.090 
to drink at night time because it will
release<00:02:27.080> not<00:02:27.230> while<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.590> sleep

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
release not while you sleep

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.710 
release not while you sleep
nighttime<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.970> actually<00:02:29.240> when<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.450> grow

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
nighttime is actually when you grow

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.390 
nighttime is actually when you grow
which<00:02:30.410> when<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.620> grow<00:02:30.800> when<00:02:31.070> you're<00:02:31.190> young

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
which when you grow when you're young

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.530 
which when you grow when you're young
when<00:02:31.430> you're<00:02:31.700> growing<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.030> height<00:02:32.210> it's<00:02:32.420> also

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
when you're growing in height it's also

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.000 
when you're growing in height it's also
when<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.810> grow<00:02:33.020> when<00:02:33.530> you're<00:02:33.650> working<00:02:33.890> out

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
when you grow when you're working out

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.440 
when you grow when you're working out
and<00:02:34.070> trying<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.280> get<00:02:34.370> big<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.180> want<00:02:35.390> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
and trying to get big so you want to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.030 
and trying to get big so you want to
maybe<00:02:35.780> have<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.020> case<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.470> protein<00:02:36.800> because<00:02:37.010> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
maybe have a case in protein because it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.680 
maybe have a case in protein because it
will<00:02:37.220> release<00:02:37.430> itself<00:02:37.850> it'll<00:02:38.390> release<00:02:38.600> all

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
will release itself it'll release all

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.880 
will release itself it'll release all
the<00:02:38.810> nutrients<00:02:39.320> throughout<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> night<00:02:39.710> while

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
the nutrients throughout the night while

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.230 
the nutrients throughout the night while
you're<00:02:39.980> sleeping<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> next<00:02:40.790> type<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.910> protein

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
you're sleeping the next type of protein

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.490 
you're sleeping the next type of protein
I'm<00:02:41.360> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.570> talk<00:02:41.690> about<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.260> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
I'm going to talk about is it really a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.140 
I'm going to talk about is it really a
certain<00:02:43.070> type<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.580> it's<00:02:43.730> more<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.030> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
certain type that it's more of like a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.210 
certain type that it's more of like a
general<00:02:44.570> grouping<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.470> proteins<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.070> that's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
general grouping of proteins and that's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.310 
general grouping of proteins and that's
actually<00:02:46.430> mass<00:02:46.880> gainers<00:02:47.390> mass<00:02:47.690> gainers<00:02:48.140> are

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
actually mass gainers mass gainers are

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.990 
actually mass gainers mass gainers are
typically<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:48.800> blend<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.280> different<00:02:49.610> proteins

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
typically a blend of different proteins

a<00:02:54.500> mass<00:02:54.860> gainer<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.250> designed<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.820> do<00:02:56.030> that

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
a mass gainer is designed to do that

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.350 
a mass gainer is designed to do that
gain<00:02:56.780> mass<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.350> there's<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.710> be<00:02:58.360> easily

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
gain mass so there's going to be easily

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.850 
gain mass so there's going to be easily
at<00:02:59.480> least<00:02:59.510> 500<00:03:00.110> calories<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.709> serving

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
at least 500 calories in a serving

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.710 
at least 500 calories in a serving
there's<00:03:01.190> going<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.340> be<00:03:01.430> roughly<00:03:02.030> over<00:03:02.390> 40

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
there's going to be roughly over 40

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.300 
there's going to be roughly over 40
grams<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.110> protein<00:03:03.380> per<00:03:03.410> serving<00:03:03.740> so<00:03:03.890> it's

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
grams of protein per serving so it's

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.620 
grams of protein per serving so it's
really<00:03:04.670> if<00:03:04.790> you're<00:03:04.940> wanting<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.209> gain<00:03:05.360> weight

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
really if you're wanting to gain weight

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.390 
really if you're wanting to gain weight
but<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:05.990> insane<00:03:06.290> home<00:03:06.440> fat<00:03:06.500> loss<00:03:06.709> journey<00:03:07.250> I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.170 
but for insane home fat loss journey I
probably<00:03:07.670> wouldn't<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.090> recommend

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
probably wouldn't really recommend

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.780 
probably wouldn't really recommend
recommend<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.290> mass<00:03:09.500> gainer<00:03:09.800> on<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.580> type<00:03:10.760> of

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
recommend a mass gainer on that type of

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.610 
recommend a mass gainer on that type of
protein<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.420> they<00:03:11.870> are<00:03:12.080> out<00:03:12.230> there<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.590> I

just wanted to kind of mention those to

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.620 
just wanted to kind of mention those to
you<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.000> might<00:03:14.090> want<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.300> stay<00:03:14.420> away<00:03:14.600> from

you so you might want to stay away from
this<00:03:14.870> next<00:03:15.260> type<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.530> protein<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.830> want<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.010> talk

this next type of protein I want to talk

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.740 
this next type of protein I want to talk
about<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.459> your<00:03:16.580> natural<00:03:16.820> proteins<00:03:17.450> this<00:03:17.630> is

about is your natural proteins this is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.479 
about is your natural proteins this is
kind<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.020> something<00:03:18.320> newer<00:03:18.560> something<00:03:19.340> I've

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
kind of something newer something I've

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.770 
kind of something newer something I've
been<00:03:19.700> dabbling<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.239> little<00:03:20.510> bit<00:03:20.600> especially

all that stuff natural proteins are a

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.100 
all that stuff natural proteins are a
good<00:03:28.489> thing<00:03:28.700> there's<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.970> whole<00:03:29.720> bunch<00:03:30.020> of

good thing there's a whole bunch of

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.360 
good thing there's a whole bunch of
different<00:03:30.230> types<00:03:30.590> because<00:03:30.830> protein<00:03:31.220> is

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
different types because protein is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.500 
different types because protein is

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
natural proteins that are out there and

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.030 
natural proteins that are out there and
they<00:03:38.300> make<00:03:38.480> these<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:39.260> they<00:03:39.410> put<00:03:39.800> them<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:39.980> a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
they make these and they put them in a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.530 
they make these and they put them in a
powder<00:03:40.250> form<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:40.970> sell<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:41.480> get

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
powder form and they sell it you can get

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.790 
powder form and they sell it you can get
to<00:03:41.600> make<00:03:41.780> your<00:03:41.930> health<00:03:42.080> food<00:03:42.230> store<00:03:42.500> at<00:03:42.650> your

to make your health food store at your
grocery<00:03:42.920> store<00:03:43.070> just<00:03:43.700> ask<00:03:43.850> for<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> natural

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
grocery store just ask for the natural

grocery store just ask for the natural
protein<00:03:44.840> section<00:03:45.260> I'm<00:03:45.860> touched<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.820> this

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
protein section I'm touched on this

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.620 
protein section I'm touched on this
because<00:03:47.030> there's<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.270> couple<00:03:47.450> advantages

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
because there's a couple advantages

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.330 
because there's a couple advantages
maybe<00:03:48.170> perhaps<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.709> natural<00:03:49.010> proteins

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
maybe perhaps the natural proteins

maybe perhaps the natural proteins
there's<00:03:49.520> not<00:03:49.640> going<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.820> be<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.970> lot<00:03:50.120> of

to be in that natural protein the one

to be in that natural protein the one
thing<00:04:00.170> I've<00:04:00.290> noticed<00:04:00.500> with<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.580> natural

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
thing I've noticed with the natural

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.910 
thing I've noticed with the natural
proteins<00:04:02.269> is<00:04:02.480> they<00:04:02.600> taste<00:04:02.840> like<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.590> doodoo

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
proteins is they taste like the doodoo

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.259 
proteins is they taste like the doodoo
but<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.370> know<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.549> can<00:04:04.760> obviously<00:04:05.000> make<00:04:05.090> it

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
but you know you can obviously make it

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.010 
but you know you can obviously make it
taste

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
taste

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.660 
taste
putting<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.530> little<00:04:06.740> bit<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.950> fruit<00:04:07.280> maybe<00:04:07.580> a

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
putting a little bit of fruit maybe a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.500 
putting a little bit of fruit maybe a
little<00:04:07.820> bit<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.000> peanut<00:04:08.240> butter<00:04:08.390> and

post-workout obviously is going to be

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.490 
post-workout obviously is going to be
the<00:05:10.240> best<00:05:10.360> time<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.870> take<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.020> protein<00:05:11.440> shake

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
the best time to take a protein shake

the best time to take a protein shake
pre-workout<00:05:12.370> pre-workout<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.390> obviously

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
pre-workout pre-workout is obviously

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.440
