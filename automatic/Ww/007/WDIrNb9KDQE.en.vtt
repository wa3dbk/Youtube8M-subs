00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
well more but i prefer so I mean at

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.030 
well more but i prefer so I mean at
least<00:04:25.760> we<00:04:26.090> made<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.510> slight<00:04:27.020> come<00:04:27.230> back<00:04:27.440> because

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
least we made a slight come back because

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.860 
least we made a slight come back because
we<00:04:28.310> were<00:04:28.520> getting<00:04:28.850> demolished<00:04:29.120> as<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:29.690> said

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
we were getting demolished as I said

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.080 
we were getting demolished as I said
before<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:31.100> we<00:04:31.310> were<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.610> win<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.000> game

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
before so if we were to win this game

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.690 
before so if we were to win this game
that<00:04:32.360> would<00:04:32.510> be<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.260> holy<00:04:34.220> grail<00:04:34.400> of

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
that would be like the holy grail of

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.600 
that would be like the holy grail of
comebacks<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.870> getting<00:04:36.680> demolished<00:04:36.890> but<00:04:37.400> I

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
comebacks and getting demolished but I
