00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
easy the amount of electronic noise is

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
easy the amount of electronic noise is
so<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.850> superior<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.110> was<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

okay<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.320> one<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.500> think<00:02:09.590> goes<00:02:10.100> into<00:02:10.310> a

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
okay this is one I think goes into a

baby's<00:02:10.700> mouth<00:02:11.030> well<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.750> think<00:02:11.810> not<00:02:12.020> anymore

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
baby's mouth well I think not anymore

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.010 
baby's mouth well I think not anymore
they<00:02:12.530> don't<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:12.830> too<00:02:12.980> much<00:02:13.010> noise<00:02:14.020> enough

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
they don't make too much noise enough

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.440 
they don't make too much noise enough
especially<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.740> bit<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.010> ran<00:02:16.190> into<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:17.330> is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
especially a bit of ran into this is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.000 
especially a bit of ran into this is
supposed<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> go<00:02:17.930> into<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.170> baby's<00:02:18.470> mouth<00:02:18.500> I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
supposed to go into a baby's mouth I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.550 
supposed to go into a baby's mouth I
think<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:20.210> tell<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.510> temperature<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.350> baby

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
think to tell the temperature the baby

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.840 
think to tell the temperature the baby
mmm<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.500> little<00:02:24.830> heat<00:02:25.460> sensitive

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
mmm this is a little heat sensitive

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.940 
mmm this is a little heat sensitive
thing<00:02:26.150> which<00:02:26.360> records<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.410> temperature<00:02:27.560> here

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
thing which records the temperature here

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.500 
thing which records the temperature here
electronically<00:02:28.640> when<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.850> turn<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.210> on<00:02:29.360> with

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
electronically when you turn it on with

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.700 
electronically when you turn it on with
a<00:02:29.570> switch<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.900> mother<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.260> tell<00:02:30.410> whether<00:02:30.560> the

get<00:07:01.290> them<00:07:01.440> in<00:07:01.530> exactly<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:01.980> right<00:07:02.070> place<00:07:02.340> with

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
get them in exactly the right place with

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.640 
get them in exactly the right place with
a<00:07:02.880> cavity<00:07:03.330> for<00:07:03.540> this<00:07:03.660> little<00:07:03.870> role<00:07:04.350> to<00:07:04.500> fit

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
a cavity for this little role to fit

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.500 
a cavity for this little role to fit
into<00:07:04.800> it's<00:07:05.550> quite<00:07:05.790> a<00:07:05.820> tough<00:07:06.030> thing<00:07:06.300> but<00:07:06.419> it

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
into it's quite a tough thing but it

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.540 
into it's quite a tough thing but it
looks<00:07:06.660> so<00:07:06.780> elegant<00:07:06.960> when<00:07:07.260> it's<00:07:07.410> done<00:07:07.560> takes<00:07:08.400> me

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
looks so elegant when it's done takes me

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.290 
looks so elegant when it's done takes me
about<00:07:08.700> five<00:07:09.240> minutes<00:07:09.300> to<00:07:09.630> do<00:07:09.810> each<00:07:09.930> time<00:07:11.300> and

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
about five minutes to do each time and

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.210 
about five minutes to do each time and
then<00:07:12.870> here's<00:07:13.140> extraordinary<00:07:13.830> little<00:07:13.950> thing

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
then here's extraordinary little thing

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.350 
then here's extraordinary little thing
little<00:07:15.740> darts<00:07:16.740> but<00:07:17.100> they've<00:07:17.280> got<00:07:17.460> these<00:07:17.669> caps

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
little darts but they've got these caps

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.680 
little darts but they've got these caps
on<00:07:18.600> which<00:07:18.750> are<00:07:18.870> very<00:07:19.020> well<00:07:19.169> known<00:07:19.229> simple<00:07:20.160> caps

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
on which are very well known simple caps

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.090 
on which are very well known simple caps
the<00:07:21.690> idea<00:07:21.960> is<00:07:22.110> you<00:07:22.260> throw<00:07:22.500> these<00:07:22.650> on<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.890> hard

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.100 
the idea is you throw these on the hard

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.640 
the idea is you throw these on the hard
concrete<00:07:23.400> floor<00:07:23.910> and<00:07:24.240> they<00:07:24.419> impact<00:07:25.290> to<00:07:25.470> make<00:07:25.620> a

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
concrete floor and they impact to make a

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.770 
concrete floor and they impact to make a
good<00:07:25.919> loud<00:07:26.130> bang<00:07:26.669> they<00:07:27.030> satisfying<00:07:27.540> but<00:07:27.720> it

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
good loud bang they satisfying but it

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.000 
good loud bang they satisfying but it
has<00:07:27.930> to<00:07:28.020> be<00:07:28.110> on<00:07:28.169> a<00:07:28.229> hard<00:07:28.410> floor<00:07:28.620> this<00:07:28.800> wood

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
has to be on a hard floor this wood

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.590 
has to be on a hard floor this wood
would<00:07:29.190> be<00:07:29.340> wouldn't<00:07:29.640> be<00:07:29.760> hard<00:07:29.940> enough<00:07:30.120> so<00:07:30.180> I

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
would be wouldn't be hard enough so I

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.360 
would be wouldn't be hard enough so I
bought<00:07:31.229> along<00:07:31.410> as<00:07:31.560> an<00:07:31.650> advice<00:07:31.890> which<00:07:32.100> I<00:07:32.220> made

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
bought along as an advice which I made

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.190 
bought along as an advice which I made
all<00:07:32.490> those<00:07:32.640> years<00:07:32.820> ago<00:07:32.940> and<00:07:33.390> I<00:07:33.810> tried<00:07:34.050> dropping

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
all those years ago and I tried dropping

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.600 
all those years ago and I tried dropping
them<00:07:34.470> from<00:07:34.680> a<00:07:34.710> height<00:07:34.890> and<00:07:35.130> see<00:07:35.220> if<00:07:35.280> I<00:07:35.370> can<00:07:35.520> make

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
them from a height and see if I can make

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.370 
them from a height and see if I can make
them<00:07:35.729> bang<00:07:36.000> it's<00:07:36.390> a<00:07:36.450> quite<00:07:36.630> a<00:07:36.660> loud<00:07:36.900> bang<00:07:37.140> these

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
them bang it's a quite a loud bang these

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.760 
them bang it's a quite a loud bang these
are<00:07:37.560> these<00:07:38.010> are<00:07:38.160> powerful<00:07:38.580> taps<00:07:39.000> but<00:07:39.330> they're

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 
are these are powerful taps but they're

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.740 
are these are powerful taps but they're
quite<00:07:40.770> a<00:07:40.800> height<00:07:41.160> of<00:07:41.190> noise<00:07:41.430> I'm<00:07:42.390> not<00:07:42.600> sure

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750 
quite a height of noise I'm not sure

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.270 
quite a height of noise I'm not sure
they<00:07:42.870> all<00:07:42.990> work<00:07:43.229> so<00:07:43.260> I'll<00:07:43.620> try<00:07:43.860> one<00:07:44.040> and<00:07:44.190> then

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
they all work so I'll try one and then

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:52.780 
they all work so I'll try one and then
the<00:07:44.430> other<00:07:45.650> one<00:07:46.650> element<00:07:49.490> and<00:07:50.490> the<00:07:50.669> third<00:07:50.850> one

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.790 
the other one element and the third one

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.890 
the other one element and the third one
nope<00:07:53.790> didn't<00:07:54.300> hit<00:07:54.419> the<00:07:54.600> thing<00:07:56.540> go<00:07:57.540> get<00:07:57.750> me<00:07:57.870> a

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 
nope didn't hit the thing go get me a

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:11.200 
nope didn't hit the thing go get me a
