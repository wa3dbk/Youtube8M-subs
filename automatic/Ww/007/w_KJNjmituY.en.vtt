00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the other but I don't think that's what

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.240 
the other but I don't think that's what
we<00:00:52.110> ought<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> focus<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.160> we

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
we ought to focus on I think what we

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
we ought to focus on I think what we
ought<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> focus<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.719> your<00:00:55.050> work<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
ought to focus on is that your work and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
ought to focus on is that your work and
your<00:00:55.559> dog<00:00:55.770> you're<00:00:56.489> trying<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> progress<00:00:57.420> your

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.959 
dog to go from A to B tracking something
I<00:01:01.770> personally<00:01:02.250> think<00:01:02.579> he's<00:01:02.760> actually

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I personally think he's actually

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.160 
I personally think he's actually
following<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> hooves<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> blood<00:01:04.019> you

following the hooves and the blood you
lay<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> ground<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:04.890> again<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.820> at

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
lay on the ground but again that's at

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.580 
lay on the ground but again that's at
the<00:01:06.540> end<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> day<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.140> probably<00:01:07.290> not

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the end of the day it's probably not

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
the end of the day it's probably not
that<00:01:07.650> relevant<00:01:08.100> what's<00:01:08.460> relevant<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.939> you're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
young deer you know does it does it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.679 
young deer you know does it does it
matter<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.369> first<00:01:20.729> response<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
matter in my first response to that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.859 
matter in my first response to that
would<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:22.100> age<00:01:23.420> obviously<00:01:24.420> probably<00:01:24.600> wouldn't

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
would be age obviously probably wouldn't

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
would be age obviously probably wouldn't
matter<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> deer<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.040> actually

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
matter but how the deer was actually

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
matter but how the deer was actually
harvested<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.869> opinion<00:01:28.020> wouldn't

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
harvested I think in my opinion wouldn't

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
harvested I think in my opinion wouldn't
matter<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> deer<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.189> knows<00:01:29.579> he<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.030> hit<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
matter a deer that knows he is hit and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.910 
matter a deer that knows he is hit and
hit<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> secrete<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.700> odor

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
hit good is going to secrete an odor

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.410 
hit good is going to secrete an odor
different<00:01:34.920> than<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> live<00:01:35.700> hot<00:01:35.939> healthy<00:01:36.240> dude

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
different than a live hot healthy dude

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
different than a live hot healthy dude
and<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.960> how<00:01:37.110> these<00:01:37.259> dogs<00:01:37.759> stay<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.880> these

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and that's how these dogs stay on these

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.920 
and that's how these dogs stay on these
lines<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> being<00:01:40.530> said<00:01:40.619> my

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
lines and so with that being said my

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.060 
lines and so with that being said my
first<00:01:42.930> choice<00:01:43.170> would<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> deer<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.890> was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
first choice would be a deer that was

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.030 
first choice would be a deer that was
not<00:01:44.280> did<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.299> expire<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.930> very<00:01:46.229> quickly<00:01:46.530> okay

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
not did not expire out very quickly okay
