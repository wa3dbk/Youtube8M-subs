another<00:01:47.780> big<00:01:47.960> advantage<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:48.469> system<00:01:48.829> is

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
another big advantage this system is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.399 
another big advantage this system is
that<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.310> collapses<00:01:49.939> down<00:01:50.240> they<00:01:50.509> all<00:01:50.659> do<00:01:50.869> to

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that it collapses down they all do to

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.989 
that it collapses down they all do to
very<00:01:51.590> small<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:52.159> shipping<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.640> travel

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
very small for shipping and travel

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.169 
very small for shipping and travel
purposes<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:53.749> a<00:01:53.960> very<00:01:54.469> good<00:01:54.560> thing<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
purposes so a very good thing on the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.359 
purposes so a very good thing on the
cart<00:01:56.420> itself<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.590> important<00:01:58.039> thing<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.340> a

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
cart itself the important thing is a

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.209 
cart itself the important thing is a
rack<00:01:58.700> mount<00:01:58.969> case<00:01:59.270> or<00:01:59.539> two<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.079> this<00:02:00.319> case<00:02:00.380> rack

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
rack mount case or two in this case rack

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.069 
rack mount case or two in this case rack
mount<00:02:01.460> cases<00:02:01.880> are<00:02:02.090> designed<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.719> essentially

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
mount cases are designed to essentially

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.109 
mount cases are designed to essentially
have<00:02:03.740> rack<00:02:04.100> mount<00:02:04.340> components<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.939> these

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
have rack mount components like these

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.029 
have rack mount components like these
guys<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:06.140> them<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.530> then<00:02:06.619> have<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:06.890> have

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
guys in them and then have they have

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.460 
guys in them and then have they have
doors<00:02:07.579> they<00:02:07.909> have<00:02:08.090> covers<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.110> put<00:02:09.319> on

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
doors they have covers that you put on

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.740 
doors they have covers that you put on
the<00:02:09.860> outside<00:02:09.890> latch<00:02:10.520> down<00:02:10.819> for<00:02:11.420> shipping<00:02:11.720> so
