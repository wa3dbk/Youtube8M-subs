triangles<00:00:23.210> again<00:00:23.650> I've<00:00:24.650> used<00:00:24.920> three<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:25.310> a

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
triangles again I've used three and a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.839 
triangles again I've used three and a
half<00:00:25.490> inch<00:00:25.760> squares<00:00:26.180> of<00:00:26.750> everything<00:00:27.849> although

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
half inch squares of everything although

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.729 
half inch squares of everything although
occasionally<00:00:29.450> like<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:29.660> cross<00:00:30.020> here<00:00:30.320> I<00:00:30.349> have

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
occasionally like a cross here I have

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.440 
occasionally like a cross here I have
used<00:00:30.919> a<00:00:31.130> nine<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.520> half<00:00:31.550> inch<00:00:31.939> by<00:00:32.150> three<00:00:32.329> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.990 
used a nine and a half inch by three and
a<00:00:32.480> half<00:00:32.630> inch<00:00:32.810> rectangle<00:00:33.470> but<00:00:34.040> you<00:00:34.550> can't<00:00:34.790> just

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
a half inch rectangle but you can't just

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.970 
a half inch rectangle but you can't just
stick<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.270> squares<00:00:35.540> if<00:00:35.720> you<00:00:35.810> prefer<00:00:36.230> now<00:00:36.829> I've

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
stick to squares if you prefer now I've

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.560 
stick to squares if you prefer now I've
used<00:00:38.079> three<00:00:39.079> colors<00:00:39.649> within<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.250> jix<00:00:40.520> or<00:00:40.820> red

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
used three colors within the jix or red

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.840 
used three colors within the jix or red
yellow<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:41.870> blue<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:42.410> I've<00:00:43.040> used<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.399> gray<00:00:43.550> for

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
yellow and blue and I've used a gray for

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.880 
yellow and blue and I've used a gray for
the<00:00:43.880> border<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:45.020> also<00:00:45.260> comes<00:00:45.679> in

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
the border and that also comes in

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.799 
the border and that also comes in
occasionally<00:00:46.190> here<00:00:46.910> just<00:00:47.179> in<00:00:47.329> between<00:00:47.629> the

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
occasionally here just in between the

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.380 
occasionally here just in between the
jigsaw<00:00:48.170> pieces<00:00:48.440> as<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.160> background<00:00:49.699> the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
jigsaw pieces as the background the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.299 
jigsaw pieces as the background the
basic<00:00:51.730> idea<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.269> of<00:00:54.140> each<00:00:54.350> piece<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:55.010> an

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
basic idea of the of each piece is an

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.150 
basic idea of the of each piece is an
eight<00:00:55.609> shape<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.269> one<00:00:56.480> color<00:00:56.859> just<00:00:57.859> that

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
eight shape in one color just that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.739 
eight shape in one color just that
section<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.789> it<00:00:58.969> there<00:00:59.179> if<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.449> look<00:00:59.570> across

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
section of it there if you look across

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.759 
section of it there if you look across
there<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:01.100> will<00:01:01.280> have<00:01:01.660> two<00:01:02.769> individual

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
there and that will have two individual

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.010 
there and that will have two individual
squares<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.519> different<00:01:04.909> color<00:01:05.150> which<00:01:05.750> will

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
squares of a different color which will

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.510 
squares of a different color which will
match<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.500> with<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.830> next<00:01:07.159> one

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
match in with the next one

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.940 
match in with the next one
now<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:07.970> HS<00:01:08.450> are<00:01:08.600> rotated<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:09.590> here<00:01:09.800> I've

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
now the HS are rotated so that here I've

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.710 
now the HS are rotated so that here I've
got<00:01:10.130> an<00:01:10.280> H<00:01:10.400> running<00:01:10.820> up<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.090> down<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.270> way

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
got an H running up and down that way

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.010 
got an H running up and down that way
and<00:01:11.930> here<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.890> HS<00:01:13.840> running<00:01:14.840> horizontally

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
and here the HS running horizontally

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.950 
and here the HS running horizontally
that<00:01:15.680> way<00:01:15.920> then<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.640> next<00:01:16.909> one<00:01:17.120> is<00:01:17.360> vertically

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
that way then the next one is vertically

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.980 
that way then the next one is vertically
again<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.619> that's<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.430> way<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.750> shapes

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
again and that's the way the the shapes

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.480 
again and that's the way the the shapes
will<00:01:21.200> fit<00:01:21.380> into<00:01:21.560> each<00:01:21.770> other<00:01:22.009> like<00:01:22.189> in<00:01:22.399> a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
will fit into each other like in a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.139 
will fit into each other like in a
jigsaw<00:01:22.820> puzzle<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:24.170> knack<00:01:25.040> obviously<00:01:25.820> is

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
jigsaw puzzle the knack obviously is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.020 
jigsaw puzzle the knack obviously is
which<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.840> these<00:01:27.229> colors<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.100> have<00:01:28.310> when<00:01:28.909> you

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
which of these colors to have when you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.840 
which of these colors to have when you
make<00:01:29.240> up<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.659> 9-patch<00:01:30.259> unit<00:01:30.680> here<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.159> the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
make up this 9-patch unit here and the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.459 
make up this 9-patch unit here and the
only<00:01:32.000> way<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:32.329> I<00:01:32.390> found<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:32.899> do<00:01:33.049> it<00:01:33.140> was<00:01:33.320> to

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
only way that I found to do it was to

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.620 
only way that I found to do it was to
actually<00:01:33.619> mark<00:01:34.549> up<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.909> whole<00:01:35.119> thing<00:01:35.420> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
actually mark up the whole thing and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.649 
actually mark up the whole thing and
then<00:01:35.719> work<00:01:35.930> out<00:01:36.170> which<00:01:36.969> colors<00:01:37.969> I<00:01:38.090> wanted<00:01:38.509> like

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
then work out which colors I wanted like

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.289 
then work out which colors I wanted like
if<00:01:38.719> I<00:01:38.930> needed<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.320> yellow<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.770> red<00:01:39.799> there

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
if I needed a yellow and a red there

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.090 
if I needed a yellow and a red there
whereas<00:01:41.299> for<00:01:41.509> another<00:01:41.719> blue<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.200> needed<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:42.950> say

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
whereas for another blue I needed to say

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.999 
whereas for another blue I needed to say
two<00:01:43.159> yellows<00:01:43.820> there<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:45.320> once<00:01:45.860> you've

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
two yellows there but it's once you've

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.399 
two yellows there but it's once you've
got<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.369> pattern<00:01:46.670> it's<00:01:47.149> very<00:01:47.750> simple<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.259> put

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
got the pattern it's very simple to put

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:48.850 
got the pattern it's very simple to put
together

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
together

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.730 
together
it<00:01:49.369> measures<00:01:49.850> forty<00:01:50.390> six<00:01:50.630> inches<00:01:51.049> square<00:01:51.439> and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
it measures forty six inches square and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.279 
it measures forty six inches square and
I've<00:01:52.430> used<00:01:52.610> half<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.090> yard<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.479> all<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.960> colors

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
I've used half a yard of all the colors

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.920 
I've used half a yard of all the colors
that's<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.829> three<00:01:55.159> in<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.430> middle<00:01:55.969> plus<00:01:56.689> the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
that's the three in the middle plus the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.260 
that's the three in the middle plus the
border<00:01:57.289> as<00:01:57.350> well<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.920> they<00:01:58.369> all<00:01:58.609> need<00:01:58.820> half<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
border as well and they all need half a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.399 
border as well and they all need half a
yard<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.609> the<00:02:01.789> basic<00:02:02.210> shape<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.990> piece

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
yard this is the basic shape of a piece

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.859 
yard this is the basic shape of a piece
from<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.740> jigsaw<00:02:04.130> puzzle<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.729> I've<00:02:05.509> used<00:02:05.719> three

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
from a jigsaw puzzle and I've used three

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.529 
from a jigsaw puzzle and I've used three
and<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.079> half<00:02:06.259> inch<00:02:06.500> squares<00:02:06.920> here<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.210> a

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and a half inch squares here that is a

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.180 
and a half inch squares here that is a
nine<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.110> half<00:02:09.140> inch<00:02:09.500> by<00:02:09.679> three<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.009> half

nine and a half inch by three and a half
inch<00:02:10.399> rectangle<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.210> then<00:02:11.600> these<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:11.810> all

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
inch rectangle and then these are all

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.440 
inch rectangle and then these are all
three<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> half<00:02:12.650> inch<00:02:12.860> squares<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:14.390> we

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
three and a half inch squares now we

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.630 
three and a half inch squares now we
need<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:14.960> these<00:02:15.140> into<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> square<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.610> be

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
need to get these into a square to be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.060 
need to get these into a square to be
able<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.000> sew<00:02:17.180> them<00:02:17.360> together<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.900> blocks<00:02:18.260> so

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
able to sew them together as blocks so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.220 
able to sew them together as blocks so
in<00:02:19.310> fact<00:02:19.610> if<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:19.880> take<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.570> ones<00:02:20.780> from

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
in fact if we take off the ones from

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.770 
in fact if we take off the ones from
either<00:02:21.860> side<00:02:22.100> those<00:02:22.760> will<00:02:23.030> belong<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
either side those will belong to the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.530 
either side those will belong to the
blocks<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.500> are<00:02:24.790> put<00:02:25.790> on<00:02:25.820> either<00:02:26.120> side

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
blocks that are put on either side

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.709 
blocks that are put on either side
and<00:02:26.719> now<00:02:27.530> these<00:02:27.799> two<00:02:28.219> bits<00:02:28.430> here<00:02:28.849> are<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
and now these two bits here are the

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.360 
and now these two bits here are the
crucial<00:02:29.930> ones<00:02:30.290> because<00:02:30.769> those<00:02:30.950> will<00:02:31.219> be<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
crucial ones because those will be the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.160 
crucial ones because those will be the
colors<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.810> other<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.489> adjoining

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
colors of the other of the adjoining

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.899 
colors of the other of the adjoining
piece<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.829> supposing<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.579> yellow

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
piece so that supposing that was yellow

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.339 
piece so that supposing that was yellow
then<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.299> would<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.719> rest<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.140> yellow

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
then I would have the rest of a yellow

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.910 
then I would have the rest of a yellow
block<00:02:39.650> down<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.540> block<00:02:41.930> itself<00:02:42.379> when

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
block down here the block itself when

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.520 
block down here the block itself when
this<00:02:43.129> is<00:02:43.340> completed<00:02:43.760> as<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.470> nine<00:02:45.470> patch<00:02:45.739> can<00:02:46.430> be

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
this is completed as a nine patch can be

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.349 
this is completed as a nine patch can be
put<00:02:48.530> into<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.950> quilt<00:02:49.159> in<00:02:49.370> both<00:02:49.579> ways<00:02:49.879> so<00:02:50.209> it

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
put into the quilt in both ways so it

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.569 
put into the quilt in both ways so it
could<00:02:50.569> be<00:02:50.599> rotated<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.069> that's

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
could be rotated like that and that's

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.550 
could be rotated like that and that's
how<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.849> get<00:02:53.060> them<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.510> join<00:02:53.659> up<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.109> have<00:02:54.319> one

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
how you get them to join up you have one

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.800 
how you get them to join up you have one
that's<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:55.069> way<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:56.299> next<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
that's that way and the one next to it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.759 
that's that way and the one next to it
will<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:58.040> way<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.609> then<00:02:59.180> you<00:03:00.049> can<00:03:00.260> get

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
will be that way and then you can get

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.580 
will be that way and then you can get
them<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.099> join<00:03:01.310> up<00:03:01.459> across<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:02.060> row<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:03.349> this

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
them to join up across the row so this

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.770 
them to join up across the row so this
is<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.889> basic<00:03:04.340> block<00:03:04.459> now<00:03:04.790> I've<00:03:05.060> got<00:03:05.299> that<00:03:05.480> H

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
is the basic block now I've got that H

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.619 
is the basic block now I've got that H
in<00:03:06.169> the<00:03:06.319> blue<00:03:06.530> still<00:03:06.950> but<00:03:07.819> I've<00:03:07.970> filled<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:08.450> now

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
in the blue still but I've filled in now

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.800 
in the blue still but I've filled in now
with<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> gray<00:03:09.109> in<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:10.040> top<00:03:10.340> space<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.689> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.349 
with a gray in that top space and in a
red<00:03:12.079> in<00:03:12.349> this<00:03:12.530> bottom<00:03:13.069> space<00:03:13.340> now<00:03:13.909> I<00:03:13.939> can<00:03:14.239> sew

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
red in this bottom space now I can sew

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.089 
red in this bottom space now I can sew
these<00:03:14.540> together<00:03:14.780> across<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.590> row<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.010> then

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
these together across the row and then

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.509 
these together across the row and then
sew<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.549> rows<00:03:16.669> to<00:03:17.000> each<00:03:17.150> other<00:03:18.280> I've<00:03:19.280> made

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519

here you see the layout for the jigsaw
puzzle<00:04:32.270> quilt<00:04:32.539> I've<00:04:32.840> put<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:33.470> blocks<00:04:33.710> in<00:04:33.979> four

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
puzzle quilt I've put the blocks in four

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.760 
puzzle quilt I've put the blocks in four
rows<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.610> four<00:04:35.240> now<00:04:35.930> if<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.080> start<00:04:36.349> at<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.560> top

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
rows of four now if I start at the top

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.119 
rows of four now if I start at the top
of<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:36.979> first<00:04:37.370> row<00:04:37.610> I've<00:04:37.820> got

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
of the first row I've got

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.939 
of the first row I've got
the<00:04:38.189> H<00:04:38.309> going<00:04:38.699> up<00:04:39.119> and<00:04:39.389> down<00:04:39.539> there<00:04:39.959> and<00:04:40.319> here

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
the H going up and down there and here

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.100 
the H going up and down there and here
I've<00:04:41.129> rotated<00:04:41.489> it<00:04:41.819> so<00:04:42.029> that<00:04:42.179> the<00:04:42.300> H<00:04:42.449> goes<00:04:42.839> that

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
I've rotated it so that the H goes that

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.159 
I've rotated it so that the H goes that
way<00:04:43.349> then<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.009> H<00:04:44.129> goes<00:04:44.459> up<00:04:44.759> right<00:04:45.059> and<00:04:45.419> then<00:04:46.020> it

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
way then the H goes up right and then it

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.519 
way then the H goes up right and then it
goes<00:04:46.909> horizontally<00:04:47.909> so<00:04:48.449> that's<00:04:48.749> the<00:04:48.989> system

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 
goes horizontally so that's the system

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.429 
goes horizontally so that's the system
across<00:04:49.769> the<00:04:49.889> whole<00:04:50.189> lot<00:04:50.459> the<00:04:50.699> H<00:04:50.909> on<00:04:51.209> the<00:04:51.509> one<00:04:52.199> on

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
across the whole lot the H on the one on

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.279 
across the whole lot the H on the one on
the<00:04:52.919> second<00:04:53.309> row<00:04:53.459> is<00:04:53.899> horizontal<00:04:54.899> and<00:04:55.110> then

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
the second row is horizontal and then

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.399 
the second row is horizontal and then
next<00:04:55.499> to<00:04:55.709> it<00:04:55.739> vertical<00:04:56.389> and<00:04:57.389> now<00:04:57.749> each<00:04:58.019> time

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
next to it vertical and now each time

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.369 
next to it vertical and now each time
the<00:04:59.209> alternate<00:05:00.209> squares<00:05:00.809> which<00:05:01.050> are<00:05:01.229> within

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
the alternate squares which are within

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.820 
the alternate squares which are within
the<00:05:01.559> H<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.610> blend<00:05:02.969> in<00:05:03.209> with<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.830> squares

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
the H have to blend in with the squares

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.949 
the H have to blend in with the squares
on<00:05:04.979> either<00:05:05.129> side<00:05:05.459> of<00:05:05.489> them<00:05:05.759> I'm<00:05:06.029> using<00:05:06.569> gray

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:06.959 
on either side of them I'm using gray

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.749 
on either side of them I'm using gray
for<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.349> outside<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.249> then<00:05:08.369> I'm<00:05:08.489> going<00:05:08.669> to

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
for the outside and then I'm going to

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.299 
for the outside and then I'm going to
make<00:05:08.909> the<00:05:09.029> border<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.419> gray<00:05:09.659> as<00:05:09.869> well<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.409> so

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:11.309 
make the border of gray as well and so

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:13.129 
make the border of gray as well and so
when<00:05:11.490> there's<00:05:11.699> an<00:05:11.789> odd<00:05:11.909> gap<00:05:12.149> like<00:05:12.479> here<00:05:12.809> which

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
when there's an odd gap like here which

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.609 
when there's an odd gap like here which
is<00:05:13.699> not<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.729> new<00:05:15.119> block<00:05:15.449> then<00:05:15.779> I'm<00:05:16.019> putting<00:05:16.289> gray

00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:16.619 
is not a new block then I'm putting gray

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:19.129 
is not a new block then I'm putting gray
in<00:05:16.830> there<00:05:17.069> and<00:05:17.339> then<00:05:18.149> really<00:05:18.629> they<00:05:18.779> just<00:05:18.809> have

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
in there and then really they just have

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.989 
in there and then really they just have
to<00:05:19.289> fit<00:05:19.619> into<00:05:19.800> each<00:05:20.129> other<00:05:20.399> you<00:05:20.610> can<00:05:20.789> follow

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:20.999 
to fit into each other you can follow

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.579 
to fit into each other you can follow
across<00:05:21.619> the<00:05:22.619> colorings<00:05:23.099> I've<00:05:23.339> used<00:05:24.589> but

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:25.589 
across the colorings I've used but

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:26.959 
across the colorings I've used but
there's<00:05:25.740> no<00:05:25.860> point<00:05:26.099> me<00:05:26.189> trying<00:05:26.429> to<00:05:26.550> list<00:05:26.759> them

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
there's no point me trying to list them

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.169 
there's no point me trying to list them
all<00:05:27.119> like<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.569> if<00:05:27.869> I<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.050> turn<00:05:28.709> back<00:05:29.009> again

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:29.179 
all like that if I just turn back again

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:33.319 
all like that if I just turn back again
you<00:05:30.179> can<00:05:30.209> see<00:05:30.719> them<00:05:31.669> so<00:05:32.669> that<00:05:32.819> you<00:05:32.969> can<00:05:33.119> put

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:33.329 
you can see them so that you can put

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:35.839 
you can see them so that you can put
them<00:05:33.449> together<00:05:33.629> for<00:05:34.019> yourself<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.649> now<00:05:35.610> I'm

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
them together for yourself and now I'm

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.669 
them together for yourself and now I'm
going<00:05:36.089> to<00:05:36.209> serve<00:05:36.419> them<00:05:36.509> together<00:05:36.869> across<00:05:37.379> each

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:37.679 
going to serve them together across each

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.499 
going to serve them together across each
row<00:05:37.949> and<00:05:38.249> then<00:05:38.429> serve<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.879> rows<00:05:39.059> to<00:05:39.360> each

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
row and then serve the rows to each

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.069 
row and then serve the rows to each
other<00:05:40.789> finally<00:05:41.789> for<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.300> border<00:05:42.629> I've<00:05:42.809> used

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:43.079
