00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
a good example alright and here we are

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.250 
a good example alright and here we are
we<00:02:49.909> are<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.219> the<00:02:52.340> map<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.959> no<00:02:53.959> idea

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
we are this is the map I have no idea

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.390 
we are this is the map I have no idea
what<00:02:54.379> we<00:02:54.469> have<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.769> but<00:02:54.919> there's<00:02:55.099> chests

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
what we have to do but there's chests

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
here and this is probably the direction

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.089 
here and this is probably the direction
so<00:02:58.400> I'm<00:02:58.609> in<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.879> map<00:02:59.060> guys<00:02:59.889> let's<00:03:00.889> just<00:03:01.010> check

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
so I'm in the map guys let's just check

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.369 
so I'm in the map guys let's just check
out<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.340> other<00:03:01.459> one<00:03:01.609> really<00:03:01.699> quickly<00:03:02.379> alright

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
out the other one really quickly alright

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.050 
out the other one really quickly alright
just<00:03:03.530> for<00:03:03.650> example<00:03:04.099> sake<00:03:04.310> we<00:03:04.519> will<00:03:04.549> check<00:03:04.939> out

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
just for example sake we will check out

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.349 
just for example sake we will check out
the<00:03:05.180> other<00:03:05.299> one<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:07.189> yep<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.939> just<00:03:08.269> a

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
the other one and yep this is just a

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.599 
the other one and yep this is just a
different<00:03:08.480> one<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.840> guess<00:03:12.400> yeah<00:03:13.400> basically

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
different one I guess yeah basically

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.729 
different one I guess yeah basically
it's<00:03:14.060> actually<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.419> same<00:03:14.659> thing<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.139> um<00:03:15.290> that

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
it's actually the same thing but um that

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.280 
it's actually the same thing but um that
all<00:03:16.430> maps<00:03:16.819> are<00:03:17.060> like<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.419> basically<00:03:17.780> all<00:03:18.169> you

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
all maps are like this basically all you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.890 
all maps are like this basically all you
do<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:19.129> download<00:03:19.579> them<00:03:19.669> and<00:03:19.939> you<00:03:20.629> can<00:03:20.750> see<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
do you download them and you can see the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.110 
do you download them and you can see the
plane<00:03:21.109> there<00:03:21.319> from<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.919> crash<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.400> guess<00:03:22.579> this

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
plane there from the crash I guess this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.390 
plane there from the crash I guess this
is<00:03:23.239> where<00:03:23.299> we<00:03:23.359> crashed<00:03:23.689> um<00:03:24.349> all<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.189> do<00:03:25.280> is

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
is where we crashed um all you do is

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.249 
is where we crashed um all you do is
download<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.849> extract<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.629> into<00:03:26.840> your<00:03:26.959> saves
