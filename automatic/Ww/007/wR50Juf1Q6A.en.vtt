right under the top here and then these

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
right under the top here and then these
are<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> different<00:01:12.060> current<00:01:12.780> conditions

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
are the different current conditions

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.760 
are the different current conditions
maps<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> plot<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:15.509> plot<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> map<00:01:16.320> all

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
maps that we can plot to plot a map all

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
maps that we can plot to plot a map all
you<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> double<00:01:17.820> click<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you have to do is double click one of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.969 
you have to do is double click one of
them<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.930> let's<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.380> something<00:01:19.619> simple

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
them so let's just do something simple

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.480 
them so let's just do something simple
let's<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> temperatures<00:01:21.950> as<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.340> see

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
let's do the temperatures as you can see

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.070 
let's do the temperatures as you can see
the<00:01:23.640> bottom<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> status<00:01:24.479> bar<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.840> here

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the bottom of the status bar down here

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
the bottom of the status bar down here
it<00:01:25.170> says<00:01:25.200> downloading<00:01:25.799> complete<00:01:26.159> rendering

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it says downloading complete rendering

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.240 
it says downloading complete rendering
image<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.840> draws<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.229> map<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.130> can

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
image then it draws your map now you can

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.359 
image then it draws your map now you can
see<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.640> map<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.630> shaded<00:01:31.530> areas<00:01:32.189> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
see on this map we have shaded areas in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.760 
see on this map we have shaded areas in
between<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> lines<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> ocean

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
between the lines out here in the ocean

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
between the lines out here in the ocean
where<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.250> cursor<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.450> easier<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.840> point

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
where my cursor is it's easier to point

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.270 
where my cursor is it's easier to point
out<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.290> I'm<00:01:37.409> talking<00:01:37.890> about

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
out what I'm talking about

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.789 
out what I'm talking about
you'll<00:01:38.850> color<00:01:39.150> between<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.780> lines<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you'll color between these lines the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.850 
you'll color between these lines the
lines<00:01:41.040> themself<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.939> highlighted<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.020> you

lines themself are highlighted and you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
lines themself are highlighted and you
have<00:01:44.009> values<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.420> look<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> upper

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
have values now if we look in the upper

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
have values now if we look in the upper
left<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.640> settings

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
left that's this is what the settings

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
left that's this is what the settings
are<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.960> shaded<00:01:49.350> selected

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
are for this you have shaded selected

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.100 
are for this you have shaded selected
you<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.189> outline<00:01:50.610> shading<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.840> what

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
you have outline shading that's what

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
you have outline shading that's what
this<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:53.060> you're<00:01:54.060> showing<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.479> label

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
this is and you're showing the label

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
this is and you're showing the label
values<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> let's<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.840> again<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.740> some

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
values so let's do this again with some

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.319 
values so let's do this again with some
different<00:01:59.250> options<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.240> an

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
different options just so you get an

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
different options just so you get an
idea<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> looks<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.670> first<00:02:02.670> we'll

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
idea what it looks like first we'll

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
idea what it looks like first we'll
clear<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.270> map<00:02:03.450> by<00:02:03.659> double<00:02:03.930> clicking<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.439> we

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
clear the map by double clicking what we

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
clear the map by double clicking what we
selected<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.390> then<00:02:06.390> we'll<00:02:06.570> go<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> top

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
selected and then we'll go up to the top

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.580 
selected and then we'll go up to the top
here<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.860> we'll<00:02:08.039> select<00:02:08.220> contoured<00:02:09.590> notice

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
here and we'll select contoured notice

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.949 
here and we'll select contoured notice
that<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.039> only<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.690> contoured<00:02:12.690> or

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
that you can only have contoured or

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.320 
that you can only have contoured or
shade

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
shade

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.190 
shade
selected<00:02:13.900> at<00:02:14.050> one<00:02:14.560> time<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:16.660> contoured

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
selected at one time with contoured

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.620 
selected at one time with contoured
selected<00:02:17.770> we<00:02:18.190> redraw<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.670> map<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.540> can

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
selected we redraw the map is you can

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.290 
selected we redraw the map is you can
see<00:02:19.780> by<00:02:19.960> this<00:02:20.020> map<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.830> no<00:02:21.610> longer<00:02:21.940> have<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
see by this map you no longer have the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.450 
see by this map you no longer have the
shading<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> contoured<00:02:24.010> value

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
shading you just have a contoured value

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.550 
shading you just have a contoured value
now<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.210> case<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.720> outline<00:02:26.110> shading

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
now in this case the outline shading

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.990 
now in this case the outline shading
isn't<00:02:26.860> actually<00:02:27.190> gonna<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.550> anything<00:02:27.730> because

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
isn't actually gonna do anything because

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.120 
isn't actually gonna do anything because
that<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.390> applies<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.750> shading<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.710> it<00:02:29.890> says

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that just applies to shading as it says

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.400 
that just applies to shading as it says
next<00:02:30.700> we'll<00:02:30.820> do<00:02:31.000> another<00:02:31.270> map<00:02:31.570> without<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
next we'll do another map without the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.450 
next we'll do another map without the
labels<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.570> map<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.020> get

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
labels and this is the map that you get

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.760 
labels and this is the map that you get
notice<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.580> there's<00:02:36.820> no<00:02:37.440> labels<00:02:38.440> and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
notice that there's no labels and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.070 
notice that there's no labels and
there's<00:02:39.130> no<00:02:39.280> shading<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.790> between<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.960> can

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
there's no shading in between you can

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.350 
there's no shading in between you can
also<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.500> shading<00:02:41.830> without<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.580> label<00:02:42.910> values

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
also do shading without the label values

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.430 
also do shading without the label values
in<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:44.560> case<00:02:44.830> we're<00:02:45.100> gonna<00:02:45.220> shade<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:46.570> we're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
in this case we're gonna shade but we're

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.140 
in this case we're gonna shade but we're
gonna<00:02:47.590> outline<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.490> we're<00:02:48.610> not<00:02:48.760> gonna<00:02:48.880> put

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
gonna outline it but we're not gonna put

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150 
gonna outline it but we're not gonna put
labels<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.620> that's<00:02:50.800> what<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.010> looks

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
labels on it so that's what that looks

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.320 
labels on it so that's what that looks
like<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.940> also<00:02:52.780> notice<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:55.180> in

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
like and also notice that like like in

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.730 
like and also notice that like like in
the<00:02:55.420> previous<00:02:55.810> video<00:02:56.140> where<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.290> showed<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
the previous video where I showed you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.260 
the previous video where I showed you
that<00:02:56.920> when<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.220> move<00:02:57.490> your<00:02:57.670> mouse<00:02:57.820> over<00:02:58.240> a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
that when you move your mouse over a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.449 
that when you move your mouse over a
certain<00:02:58.510> County<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.709> will<00:02:59.920> show<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
certain County it will show you the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.850 
certain County it will show you the
county<00:03:00.790> name<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.750> far<00:03:01.990> lower<00:03:02.260> left<00:03:02.620> as

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
county name and the far lower left as

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.230 
county name and the far lower left as
you<00:03:02.950> can<00:03:03.040> see<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.250> says<00:03:03.400> Humboldt<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.060> Elko

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
you can see it says Humboldt and Elko

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.340 
you can see it says Humboldt and Elko
down<00:03:04.720> there<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.940> put<00:03:07.209> your<00:03:07.360> mouse<00:03:07.510> over<00:03:08.020> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
down there if you put your mouse over a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.410 
down there if you put your mouse over a
line<00:03:08.830> it'll<00:03:09.250> also<00:03:09.400> tell<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.940> value<00:03:10.120> of

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
line it'll also tell you the value of

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.840 
line it'll also tell you the value of
that<00:03:10.600> line<00:03:11.070> right<00:03:12.070> now<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> far<00:03:12.610> lower

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
that line right now in the far lower

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.290 
that line right now in the far lower
left<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.300> says<00:03:13.480> 55<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.470> where<00:03:14.650> my<00:03:14.940> cursor<00:03:15.940> is

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
left it says 55 so where my cursor is

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.800 
left it says 55 so where my cursor is
over<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.990> line<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:18.250> lines<00:03:18.519> value<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.209> 55

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
over that line the lines value is 55

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.620 
over that line the lines value is 55
degrees<00:03:20.170> now<00:03:20.650> look<00:03:21.550> closely<00:03:21.880> at<00:03:22.150> how<00:03:22.360> this

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
degrees now look closely at how this

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.410 
degrees now look closely at how this
line<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.739> outlining<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.790> shaded<00:03:25.120> area

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
line is outlining the shaded area

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.880 
line is outlining the shaded area
because<00:03:25.870> I'm<00:03:26.019> gonna<00:03:26.140> do<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.440> again<00:03:26.530> without

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
because I'm gonna do it again without

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.710 
because I'm gonna do it again without
the<00:03:27.070> outlining<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.440> as<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.709> see<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:30.130> this

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the outlining so as you can see in this

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.360 
the outlining so as you can see in this
way<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.870> drawing<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.290> map<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.980> lot<00:03:33.160> less

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
way of drawing the map it's a lot less

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.400 
way of drawing the map it's a lot less
obvious<00:03:33.880> where<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.150> edges<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.900> contours

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
obvious where the edges of the contours

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.890 
obvious where the edges of the contours
are<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.280> also<00:03:36.430> just<00:03:36.760> plot<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.300> values<00:03:37.690> by

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
are you can also just plot the values by

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.930 
are you can also just plot the values by
themselves<00:03:38.500> when<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.830> select<00:03:39.130> plot<00:03:39.400> values

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
themselves when you select plot values

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.940 
themselves when you select plot values
only<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.630> will<00:03:40.780> not<00:03:40.959> draw<00:03:41.350> any<00:03:42.250> lines<00:03:42.700> or

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
only it will not draw any lines or

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.710 
only it will not draw any lines or
shading<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.160> will<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.670> show<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.120> values<00:03:46.510> on

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
shading it will just show the values on

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.390 
shading it will just show the values on
the<00:03:46.750> map<00:03:47.050> when<00:03:47.500> you're<00:03:47.620> zoomed<00:03:47.860> out<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.250> map

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
the map when you're zoomed out the map

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.530 
the map when you're zoomed out the map
displays<00:03:49.769> random<00:03:50.769> temperatures<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.330> it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
displays random temperatures so it

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.050 
displays random temperatures so it
doesn't<00:03:52.870> overlap<00:03:53.140> on<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.590> values<00:03:53.980> but<00:03:54.790> as<00:03:54.910> you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
doesn't overlap on the values but as you

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.259 
doesn't overlap on the values but as you
zoom<00:03:55.269> in<00:03:56.070> more<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.190> more<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.400> those<00:03:57.519> values

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
zoom in more and more of those values

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.229 
zoom in more and more of those values

more<00:04:01.510> because<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.920> able<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.280> fit<00:04:03.640> them

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910

without overlapping the values when you

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.449 
without overlapping the values when you
zoom<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.050> like<00:04:08.200> this<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> could<00:04:08.680> also<00:04:08.860> turn<00:04:09.280> on

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
zoom in like this you could also turn on

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.270 
zoom in like this you could also turn on
cities<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.239> can<00:04:10.450> actually<00:04:10.630> see<00:04:11.280> what

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
cities so you can actually see what

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.349 
cities so you can actually see what
cities<00:04:12.700> these<00:04:13.540> values<00:04:13.989> are<00:04:14.140> by<00:04:14.430> but<00:04:15.430> again

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
cities these values are by but again

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.759 
cities these values are by but again
with<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.750> it<00:04:18.540> removes<00:04:19.540> some<00:04:19.989> either<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.380> city

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
with that it removes some either a city

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.590 
with that it removes some either a city
or<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.040> value<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.700> try<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> keep<00:04:22.180> things<00:04:22.450> from

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
or a value to try to keep things from

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.930 
or a value to try to keep things from
being<00:04:22.660> too<00:04:23.020> cluttered<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> if<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.850> know

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
being too cluttered so if you know

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.570 
being too cluttered so if you know
there's<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.330> temperature<00:04:25.780> up<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.050> this<00:04:26.200> area

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
there's a temperature up in this area

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.839 
there's a temperature up in this area
maybe<00:04:26.879> you<00:04:27.569> could<00:04:27.720> zoom<00:04:27.960> in<00:04:28.169> more<00:04:28.759> to<00:04:29.759> actually

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
maybe you could zoom in more to actually

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.760 
maybe you could zoom in more to actually
see<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.300> value<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:31.199> that's<00:04:31.379> a<00:04:31.500> case<00:04:31.680> where

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.309 

having<00:04:35.240> too<00:04:36.240> much<00:04:36.419> on<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.719> map<00:04:36.900> can<00:04:37.169> be

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
having too much on the map can be

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.980 
having too much on the map can be
harmful<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.879> you<00:04:39.030> want<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.300> actual<00:04:39.629> value

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
harmful but if you want the actual value

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.189 
harmful but if you want the actual value
instead<00:04:40.229> of<00:04:40.349> a<00:04:40.710> contoured<00:04:41.699> smooth<00:04:42.120> Dover<00:04:42.629> map

instead of a contoured smooth Dover map
this<00:04:43.710> might<00:04:43.919> be<00:04:44.039> useful<00:04:44.219> now<00:04:44.969> the<00:04:45.030> label<00:04:45.270> in

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
something to make it a lot simpler to

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.890 
something to make it a lot simpler to

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
time down here so you can do the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.610 
time down here so you can do the
conversion<00:06:33.500> from

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
conversion from

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.210

right<00:07:12.600> now<00:07:12.750> I<00:07:12.780> don't<00:07:12.900> have<00:07:13.080> anything<00:07:13.289> open<00:07:13.680> so

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
right now I don't have anything open so

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.430 
right now I don't have anything open so
it's<00:07:13.979> not<00:07:14.130> gonna<00:07:14.280> auto<00:07:14.520> refresh<00:07:14.880> anything<00:07:15.449> I

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
it's not gonna auto refresh anything I

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.230 
it's not gonna auto refresh anything I
keep<00:07:17.010> that<00:07:17.190> shut<00:07:17.430> off<00:07:17.460> myself<00:07:18.180> just<00:07:18.660> because

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
keep that shut off myself just because

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.310 
keep that shut off myself just because
sometimes<00:07:21.240> I'll<00:07:21.510> be<00:07:21.600> flipping<00:07:22.020> through<00:07:22.199> the

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
sometimes I'll be flipping through the

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.990 
sometimes I'll be flipping through the
maps<00:07:22.530> and<00:07:22.770> it<00:07:22.889> just<00:07:23.100> happens<00:07:23.430> to<00:07:23.490> become<00:07:23.820> that

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
maps and it just happens to become that

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.600 
maps and it just happens to become that
time<00:07:24.270> when<00:07:24.449> it<00:07:24.539> wants<00:07:24.840> to<00:07:25.020> update<00:07:25.800> something

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
time when it wants to update something

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.939 
time when it wants to update something
and<00:07:27.120> it's<00:07:27.780> right<00:07:28.229> in<00:07:28.350> the<00:07:28.410> middle<00:07:28.440> when<00:07:28.800> I'm

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949 
and it's right in the middle when I'm

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.600 
and it's right in the middle when I'm
trying<00:07:29.400> to<00:07:29.550> do<00:07:29.760> something<00:07:30.030> manually<00:07:31.460> so<00:07:32.460> that

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
trying to do something manually so that

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.939 
trying to do something manually so that
becomes<00:07:32.910> more<00:07:33.150> useful<00:07:33.360> when<00:07:33.810> you<00:07:33.960> you<00:07:34.590> set<00:07:34.860> it

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949 
becomes more useful when you you set it

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.760 
becomes more useful when you you set it
up<00:07:35.039> to<00:07:35.280> maybe<00:07:35.669> display<00:07:36.120> warnings<00:07:36.840> or<00:07:37.199> radar

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
up to maybe display warnings or radar

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.260 
up to maybe display warnings or radar
and<00:07:38.010> you<00:07:38.100> just<00:07:38.280> want<00:07:38.490> to<00:07:38.580> keep<00:07:38.729> it<00:07:38.910> on<00:07:39.090> the

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270 
and you just want to keep it on the

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.420 
and you just want to keep it on the
screen<00:07:39.630> and<00:07:39.660> walk<00:07:40.050> away<00:07:40.320> from<00:07:40.530> it<00:07:40.710> and<00:07:40.860> come

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
screen and walk away from it and come

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.660 
screen and walk away from it and come
back<00:07:41.639> and<00:07:41.820> look<00:07:41.940> every<00:07:42.210> once<00:07:42.389> in<00:07:42.539> a<00:07:42.630> while
