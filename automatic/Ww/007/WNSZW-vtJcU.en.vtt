00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I did not like about this was one very

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.119 
I did not like about this was one very
easy<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.899> laterally<00:01:01.410> rotate<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.920> ankle

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
easy to laterally rotate that ankle

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.889 
easy to laterally rotate that ankle
because<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> whole<00:01:03.329> lot<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> sport

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
gun on the outside the other thing was

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
gun on the outside the other thing was
the<00:01:06.479> fact<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.110> heel<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.680> rub<00:01:07.979> up

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the fact that my heel would rub up

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.500 
the fact that my heel would rub up
against<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:09.080> because<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.650> thin<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
against this because it is so thin and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.000 
against this because it is so thin and
that's<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> fun<00:01:13.200> experience<00:01:13.229> couple

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
