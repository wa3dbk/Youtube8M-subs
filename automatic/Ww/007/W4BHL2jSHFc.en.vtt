00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
mark here and from this mark make a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.719 
mark here and from this mark make a
valley<00:01:36.240> fold<00:01:39.649> parallel<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.429> long<00:01:41.609> side

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
like that this is only precreasing and

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:54.139 
like that this is only precreasing and
we<00:01:48.270> open<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> model<00:01:50.520> again<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.789> see

is<00:02:41.680> already<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.360> basic<00:02:44.670> shape<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.840> two

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
is already the basic shape if the two

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.400 
is already the basic shape if the two
legs<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.610> tail<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:50.620> had<00:02:51.810> off<00:02:52.810> the

chicken<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:57.250> fold<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.329> an<00:02:58.480> easier<00:02:58.810> way<00:02:59.019> I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
chicken to fold this in an easier way I

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.830 
chicken to fold this in an easier way I
open<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.400> again<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:02.190> make<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.450> crease<00:03:04.450> from

open it again and make a crease from

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.250 
open it again and make a crease from
this<00:03:05.590> point<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.609> this<00:03:06.790> part<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:10.299> will<00:03:10.569> be<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
this point to this part this will be the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:24.400 
this point to this part this will be the
tail

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.980 

and<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.430> head<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:26.600> bring<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:28.340> point

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
and for the head just bring this point

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.460 
and for the head just bring this point
to<00:03:29.990> this<00:03:30.140> point<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:34.340> make<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:35.080> slight<00:03:36.080> a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
to this point and just make a slight a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.330 
to this point and just make a slight a
very<00:03:36.800> light<00:03:37.040> crease<00:03:37.730> here<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.490> then<00:03:42.340> collapse

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
very light crease here and then collapse

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:57.790 
very light crease here and then collapse
the<00:03:44.090> model<00:03:44.510> again<00:03:52.840> like<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:56.500> fold<00:03:57.500> the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
the model again like so and fold the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:11.620 
the model again like so and fold the
feet<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.090> front<00:04:00.790> somewhere<00:04:01.790> here<00:04:10.630> this

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
feet to the front somewhere here this

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.210 
feet to the front somewhere here this
this<00:04:12.500> edge<00:04:12.770> should<00:04:13.130> fly<00:04:13.910> on<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.900> edge

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
this edge should fly on the edge

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:25.060 
this edge should fly on the edge
underneath<00:04:21.520> something<00:04:22.520> like<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:24.070> of

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
underneath something like that and of

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.850 
underneath something like that and of
course<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.640> same<00:04:25.910> thing<00:04:26.740> on<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.220> other<00:04:28.250> side

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.190 

now<00:04:33.460> make<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.730> mountain<00:04:34.120> fold<00:04:34.300> here<00:04:36.690> too<00:04:37.720> to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
now make a mountain fold here too to

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.260 
now make a mountain fold here too to
lock<00:04:38.590> it

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:58.220 

hold<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:43.450> behind<00:04:44.190> as<00:04:45.190> far<00:04:45.580> as<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.300> goes<00:04:55.680> okay

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
hold this behind as far as it goes okay

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:06.840 
hold this behind as far as it goes okay
same<00:04:59.230> thing<00:04:59.820> here<00:05:03.000> all<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:04.620> inwards<00:05:05.620> as<00:05:06.340> far

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
same thing here all this inwards as far
