 there are people here their sharing with a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.380
 new video and this time premiering the 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.660
 new series that had told them the 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.369
 I had commented to him for a long time and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.290
 here we are starting the house of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.380
 neighbor and we will go visiting the houses 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.090
 or the worlds of the compas and this time 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 he played eating with paper today with the company 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.370
 alonso who has is a very very world 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.900
 well done this guy the truth and here 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.930
 We are going to enter your house a house of 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.360
 wood processed wood and normal wood 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 freshly cut from the tree and good 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.809
 they started making a house 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.460
 principal is the only house that has or 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.409
 be they dedicated themselves to be more pixelar 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.930
 but here as you can see they have a 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.550
 garden for one and a room for the other 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.750
 comrade so you do not get jealous and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.220
 can not do their disasters so 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.860
 everyone made their room everyone 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.870
 has its special and good side those are 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.820
 the two barracks has the house the house 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.710
 he has no more rooms and he only has that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.350
 but they told me they are in the process of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.900
 make the modifications the staircase 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
 has a very chingón banister have to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.330
 pure 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.510
 as it is called 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.130
 stone from which the memories shine and 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.290
 is his name but they have some rooms 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.180
 up here very chingones have it 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.850
 adorned with squares they have a little bed 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.970
 the part of this outside on a balcony 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.980
 the balcony faces the view that has 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.390
 900 pixels I will not show them 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.100
 right now so that they stay 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 chopped and credited I'm going to show 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.810
 on the top of the roof that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.690
 the roof is coming but if it is the floor 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.170
 from the last plant some colors very 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.729
 nice white coffee gray and red the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.960
 it really looks very elegant very nice 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.760
 he has a little bed here with some 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.140
 umbrellas to sunbathe for 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.030
 grab the fresh and cool here 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.940
 up a pool or jacuzzi I got 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.410
 them very good the truth is this 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.820
 video I wanted it commented on 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.930
 I live because the contour was put together 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.090
 chingón and I think that way they will continue 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.970
 being the others here a balcony he cited 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.010
 but he told them he had a problem 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.050
 record it or this is I recorded well all the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.940
 I recorded it very well but the audio 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.110
 serious new did not come out to me so they are 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.480
 mistakes that will happen a little bit to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.890
 little here the term the house and we 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.060
 We were going but I remembered since they 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 They had 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.490
 in this past it is a secret passage or 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.300
 a 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.610
 as he calls it 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.350
 where you store all your stuff the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.120
 it's really nice because only 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.210
 they have tidy they have iron doors 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.950
 very good since everything is seen 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.950
 more elegant not as much as the wood that 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.070
 it's a little more not so much in elegant 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.870
 but to be more presentable with 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.960
 iron so well then this was a 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.350
 from here they had different things not here 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.540
 can see they have diamond blocks and 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.270
 because it is what they say to them, he saw my 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.120
 English that upload the video and then they 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.380
 now they have stored all the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.570
 who are using the materials that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.910
 are using then let's continue 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.830
 since there with paper today I was 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.180
 working but as always not only 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.430
 everything can go perfectly in 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.470
 I was working on the beat of getting out and 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.940
 that was all because of the very nice house 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.430
 made of wood with windows and everything 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.020
 with a very nice front yard and there 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.150
 we are from the top as 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.220
 you can see there is a more general view 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 what is the house what is the facade and 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.300
 well let's go down there's a part of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.100
 below are the pixels what the most 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.270
 important in this case since well to me 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.220
 I was very struck by what 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.810
 they had done has a few pixels very 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.490
 good maybe some are going to say that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.030
 are the basic ones or the ones that almost all 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.640
 they have but always that effort are 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.730
 times of entertainment so they have 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.560
 the mushroom that I have my world the fungus 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.270
 de mario bros is a well-known mushroom 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.330
 why do you want that in the mario bros 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.849
 well that is the pixelar of the mario pardon 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.830
 of the mushroom and this world have done 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.260
 between the two this a coll world has 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.540
 collaborated by both the bear and the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.430
 Hair have already done a bit of everything 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.920
 have here on this side has the peak of 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.360
 diamond very well done since some 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.150
 they do it from pure wood but this is 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.880
 composition with wood and wool coffee 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.220
 that if they realize the one in the peak has 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.780
 those two colors here in this part 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.760
 where they can see there is a trunk there they have 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.950
 save all the things that use what 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.479
 they have doubled here they have a shotgun me 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.510
 they said in a model the shore not the truth 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.139
 I do not remember but a complete 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.110
 shotgun forgiveness 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.110
 It is very beautiful this wide or it has 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.590
 very exact dimensions with very details 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.689
 good as are the colors of the trigger 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.360
 They used 34 types of colors and they are very 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.979
 good in the part of here we have good 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.479
 you are seeing others but right now 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.550
 we are focusing on the puppy in 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.469
 the little wolf that we all know that what 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.069
 we have to domesticate that if it is not 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:55.080
 domesticated does not have the tie or has the 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.520
 ribbon that has a bit on the neck 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.099
 and in this case he treated us 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.860
 seeing what is the ghost and scripps 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.720
 the ghost of cervo if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.300
 that goes out in hell 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.250
 lower world and here we have an iphone 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.630
 this the truth is very elegant what 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.660
 they made with aluminum with white wool 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.310
 with gray wool and with black wool if I do not 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.000
 I 'm wrong and here if any because it flies 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.430
 Let's see how the guide is not 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.160
 in the part of when you put the 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.530
 little squares did not come out to me as they take 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.650
 well we did it well and as you can see 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.000
 there is the little known ball 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.560
 pokemon that's where the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.630
 pokemons and you teach them the part of 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.690
 back the back of the iphone very 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.060
 good because you see the apple logo very 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.000
 very small the truth was raffled because 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.070
 it comes out very very nice and good I know that 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.990
 They are tired of hearing me very very very 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.860
 nice but it 's a word that 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.650
 hit me I liked that I always used and a 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.480
 way to express to you how father is 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.490

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.230
