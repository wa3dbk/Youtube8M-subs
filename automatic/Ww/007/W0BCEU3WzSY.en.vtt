00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.049
 Of course it is necessary because you represent yourself 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.979
 I think it was very little 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.979
 this applies to you 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.989
 now the french have contact percent 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.259
 just call at night contract 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.529
 Yesterday in the chic that and for the ipad and she 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.129
 Of course there is also January about this trend 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.410
 results of the competition almost 5 percent 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.880
 until the end of Ramadan but there did not pay 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
 dream track 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.050
 this outflow of 1000 s 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 in turn put their values 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.740
 from this partnership 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.820
 it is to emphasize specialist 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 so the wife of Chechnya 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.050
 imagine practicality in the first 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.860
 same celandine site 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.410
 Chan Tososh this particular change in the composition 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 metal prices in the bedroom 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.600
 writer means will not 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.190
 barry in practice 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.360
 and though simple guys later assistant 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 nationalist summit of countries 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.760
 mortgage turn on chieftain 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.750
 controlling interest will remain 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.850
 because they believe that where we are 16 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.260
 April 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.100
 but then called the more dangerous that neighbor 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 never 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.620
 when ta 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.060
 it turned out that she was clearly visible for months 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.510
 but for now 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.990
 cost merchants to repeat them 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.060
 children and tarasyuk dance to us 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.900
 so even the chances of a place savers 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.830
 has gone 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.080
 standing 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080
 and what signed the memorandum 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.860
 all wall cards 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 it spent for his family 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.290
 starting from the terrace yesterday as part of the report 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.670
 promoting permanent balog 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.569
 for the final stage 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.230
 although several terrorist attacks including bp 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.230
 hot ddr2 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.019
 so I even thought that 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.659
 the process of changing the appointment of air traffic 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 basement should explain do not speak 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.119
 but he also became Tatarstan 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.209
 consistent with our scientists estimates
