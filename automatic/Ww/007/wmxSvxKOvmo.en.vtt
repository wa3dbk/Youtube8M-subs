motion<00:03:07.169> balls<00:03:07.379> i'm<00:03:07.889> also<00:03:08.069> not<00:03:08.450> overly

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
motion balls i'm also not overly

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.780 
motion balls i'm also not overly
confident<00:03:10.409> or<00:03:10.560> competent<00:03:11.040> with<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.459> Recon

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
confident or competent with the Recon

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.149 
confident or competent with the Recon
kit<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.239> don't<00:03:12.959> toss<00:03:13.169> motion<00:03:13.620> sensors<00:03:13.950> when<00:03:14.129> I

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
kit I don't toss motion sensors when I

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.280 
kit I don't toss motion sensors when I
should<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:14.760> that's<00:03:15.599> something<00:03:15.840> else<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.169> I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
should so that's something else that I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
should so that's something else that I
want<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.560> do<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.489> try<00:03:17.699> and<00:03:17.819> figure<00:03:17.970> out

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
want to do is is just try and figure out

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.839 
want to do is is just try and figure out
where<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.959> most<00:03:19.349> effective<00:03:19.859> motion<00:03:20.549> sensor

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
where the most effective motion sensor

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.789 
where the most effective motion sensor
placement<00:03:21.060> would<00:03:21.359> be<00:03:21.479> and<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.930> I'm<00:03:22.349> taking<00:03:22.650> my

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
placement would be and and I'm taking my

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.020 
placement would be and and I'm taking my
time<00:03:23.010> here<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.400> building<00:03:23.639> because<00:03:23.849> I

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
time here in this building because I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.610 
time here in this building because I
know<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.389> there's<00:03:24.569> someone<00:03:24.750> else<00:03:24.930> close<00:03:25.379> by

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
know that there's someone else close by

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.949 
know that there's someone else close by
I<00:03:25.979> don't<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.430> quite<00:03:26.639> where<00:03:26.849> he<00:03:26.879> is<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.329> I'm

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
I don't know quite where he is and I'm

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.210 
I don't know quite where he is and I'm
going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.169> clear<00:03:28.379> the<00:03:28.470> building<00:03:28.590> next<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.069> me

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
going to clear the building next to me

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.059 
going to clear the building next to me
if<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.639> discover<00:03:30.449> that<00:03:30.750> there's<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.319> guy<00:03:31.440> who<00:03:31.500> had

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
if I discover that there's a guy who had

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.710 
if I discover that there's a guy who had
found<00:03:32.310> camping<00:03:32.729> quite<00:03:32.909> a<00:03:32.940> few<00:03:33.150> times<00:03:33.389> and

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
found camping quite a few times and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.240 
found camping quite a few times and
there<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.409> he's<00:03:34.590> sitting<00:03:34.859> there<00:03:34.889> so<00:03:35.220> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
there is he's sitting there so I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.119 
there is he's sitting there so I
actually<00:03:35.639> do<00:03:35.970> get<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.659> very<00:03:37.199> close<00:03:37.470> quarters<00:03:37.889> no

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
actually do get a very close quarters no

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.080 
actually do get a very close quarters no
scope<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.790> again<00:03:39.510> not<00:03:40.069> not<00:03:41.069> like<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.760> skills

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
scope so again not not like the skills

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.599 
scope so again not not like the skills
you<00:03:42.269> see<00:03:42.510> out<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:43.470> stone<00:03:43.769> or<00:03:44.069> Barney<00:03:44.489> or

you see out of like stone or Barney or
any<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.909> those<00:03:45.000> guys<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.269> are<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.599> console

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
any of those guys that are on console

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.259 
any of those guys that are on console
but<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:47.099> know<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.310> improving<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:48.000> I'm

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
but you know I'm improving and I'm

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.659 
but you know I'm improving and I'm
working<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.169> constantly<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:49.979> you<00:03:50.579> know

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
working on that constantly so you know

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.219 
working on that constantly so you know
right<00:03:50.879> here<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.060> take<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.389> time<00:03:51.569> for<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.900> longer

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
right here I take my time for the longer

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.839 
right here I take my time for the longer
shots<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.769> could<00:03:53.040> have<00:03:53.099> gotten<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.459> target<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
shots I could have gotten on target a

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.789 
shots I could have gotten on target a
little<00:03:54.030> bit<00:03:54.120> quicker<00:03:54.359> there<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.629> think<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.019> you

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
little bit quicker there I think but you

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.349 
little bit quicker there I think but you
know<00:03:55.919> I'm<00:03:56.099> just<00:03:56.159> I'm<00:03:56.760> trying<00:03:56.939> to<00:03:57.090> be<00:03:57.209> accurate

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
know I'm just I'm trying to be accurate

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.599 
know I'm just I'm trying to be accurate
and<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.470> know<00:03:58.560> trying<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.889> get<00:03:59.010> good<00:03:59.549> at

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
and you know trying to get good at

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.580 
and you know trying to get good at
getting<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.180> target<00:04:00.479> before<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.750> get<00:04:00.930> fast<00:04:01.229> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
getting on target before I get fast and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.039 
getting on target before I get fast and
I<00:04:02.129> didn't<00:04:02.790> want<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.150> run<00:04:03.419> the<00:04:03.569> four<00:04:03.810> times

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
I didn't want to run the four times

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.319 
I didn't want to run the four times
optical<00:04:04.349> on<00:04:04.829> this<00:04:05.099> because<00:04:05.370> i<00:04:05.549> use<00:04:05.849> red<00:04:06.090> dot<00:04:06.299> on

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
optical on this because i use red dot on

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.179 
optical on this because i use red dot on
most<00:04:06.599> of<00:04:06.689> my<00:04:06.810> other<00:04:06.840> guns<00:04:07.199> and<00:04:07.500> i<00:04:07.829> wanted<00:04:08.159> to

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
most of my other guns and i wanted to

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.460 
most of my other guns and i wanted to
keep<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.729> sensitivity<00:04:09.389> roughly<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> same<00:04:10.049> so

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
keep the sensitivity roughly the same so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.309 
keep the sensitivity roughly the same so
you<00:04:11.009> know<00:04:11.099> in<00:04:11.370> close<00:04:11.699> quarters<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.389> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
you know in close quarters and the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.749 
you know in close quarters and the
longer<00:04:13.620> shots<00:04:13.799> i<00:04:14.009> miss<00:04:14.189> a<00:04:14.220> lot<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.549> them

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:14.759 
longer shots i miss a lot of them

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.729 
longer shots i miss a lot of them
because<00:04:15.000> i<00:04:15.030> only<00:04:15.209> get<00:04:15.359> one<00:04:15.509> crack<00:04:15.720> at<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.049> but

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
because i only get one crack at it but

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.710 
because i only get one crack at it but
as<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.519> game<00:04:17.549> goes<00:04:17.849> on<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.060> get<00:04:18.299> better<00:04:18.479> and

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
as the game goes on I get better and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.420 
as the game goes on I get better and
better<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.380> that's<00:04:19.709> basically<00:04:19.979> what<00:04:20.340> I'm

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
better and and that's basically what I'm

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.039 
better and and that's basically what I'm
going<00:04:20.669> after

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
going after

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.899 
going after
so<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.949> know<00:04:22.039> if<00:04:22.190> you're<00:04:22.550> having<00:04:22.729> problems

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
so you know if you're having problems

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.790 
so you know if you're having problems
with<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.449> particular<00:04:23.960> area<00:04:24.319> of<00:04:24.379> the<00:04:24.590> game

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
with a particular area of the game

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.219 
with a particular area of the game
whether<00:04:25.370> that's<00:04:25.550> accuracy<00:04:26.360> or<00:04:26.389> what<00:04:27.020> have<00:04:27.199> you

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
whether that's accuracy or what have you

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.320 
whether that's accuracy or what have you
then<00:04:27.889> if<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.310> don't<00:04:28.430> challenge<00:04:28.729> yourself<00:04:28.940> and

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
then if you don't challenge yourself and

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.930 
then if you don't challenge yourself and
put<00:04:29.539> yourself<00:04:29.569> in<00:04:30.050> situations<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:31.400> use<00:04:31.699> those

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
put yourself in situations to use those

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.520 
put yourself in situations to use those
skills<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.389> improve<00:04:32.629> those<00:04:32.870> skills<00:04:33.169> then

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
skills and improve those skills then

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.809 
skills and improve those skills then
you're<00:04:33.860> never<00:04:34.009> going<00:04:34.159> to<00:04:34.190> get<00:04:34.340> any<00:04:34.430> better<00:04:34.460> at

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
you're never going to get any better at

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.760 
you're never going to get any better at
it<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.810> know<00:04:35.990> that's<00:04:36.259> that's<00:04:36.500> why<00:04:36.740> I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
it and so you know that's that's why I

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.189 
it and so you know that's that's why I
opted<00:04:37.099> for<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.400> gameplay<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.060> in<00:04:38.449> an

opted for this gameplay and in an
objective<00:04:39.349> game<00:04:39.889> type<00:04:40.159> I<00:04:40.340> would<00:04:40.550> not<00:04:40.729> run<00:04:40.909> this

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
objective game type I would not run this

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
well so right here I've actually

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.860 
well so right here I've actually
achieved<00:05:07.190> my<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.909> Insignia<00:05:08.389> is<00:05:08.479> going

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
achieved my the Insignia is going

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.469 
achieved my the Insignia is going
forward<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.259> m95<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:11.000> gets<00:05:11.120> me<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.330> bunch

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
forward the m95 and it gets me a bunch

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.480 
forward the m95 and it gets me a bunch
of<00:05:11.599> points<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.169> eventually<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:13.310> know<00:05:13.340> it

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
of points and eventually you know it

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.580 
of points and eventually you know it
becomes<00:05:13.969> a<00:05:14.090> close<00:05:14.300> game<00:05:14.569> so<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.840> switch<00:05:15.169> over<00:05:15.560> to

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
becomes a close game so I switch over to

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.490 
becomes a close game so I switch over to
a<00:05:16.250> new<00:05:16.550> SMG<00:05:16.909> and<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.300> do<00:05:17.360> slap<00:05:17.719> of<00:05:17.870> four<00:05:18.050> times<00:05:18.289> on

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
a new SMG and I do slap of four times on

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.869 
a new SMG and I do slap of four times on
it<00:05:18.710> I'm<00:05:19.069> just<00:05:19.280> playing<00:05:19.520> around<00:05:19.669> with

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
it I'm just playing around with

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.520 
it I'm just playing around with
different<00:05:19.940> kits<00:05:20.479> setups<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.990> see<00:05:21.169> what<00:05:21.289> I<00:05:21.349> like

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
different kits setups to see what I like

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.230 
different kits setups to see what I like
and<00:05:21.740> you<00:05:22.460> know<00:05:22.550> what<00:05:22.669> I'm<00:05:22.759> going<00:05:22.879> to<00:05:22.940> work<00:05:23.030> on

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
and you know what I'm going to work on

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.719 
and you know what I'm going to work on
next<00:05:23.449> and<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:24.259> was<00:05:24.530> before<00:05:24.949> I<00:05:25.159> had<00:05:25.279> landed<00:05:25.610> on

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
next and this was before I had landed on

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.550 
next and this was before I had landed on
the<00:05:25.819> pp-2000<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:26.840> wanted<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.229> pull<00:05:27.409> out<00:05:27.529> the

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
the pp-2000 so I wanted to pull out the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.070 
the pp-2000 so I wanted to pull out the
ak-74<00:05:28.279> you<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:28.940> do<00:05:29.389> a<00:05:29.419> bit<00:05:29.599> of<00:05:29.630> work<00:05:29.719> with<00:05:29.960> that

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
ak-74 you and do a bit of work with that

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.260 
ak-74 you and do a bit of work with that
just<00:05:30.319> to<00:05:30.380> see<00:05:30.560> how<00:05:30.620> it<00:05:30.650> felt<00:05:30.979> and<00:05:31.190> I<00:05:31.610> like<00:05:32.060> it

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
just to see how it felt and I like it

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.809 
just to see how it felt and I like it
it's<00:05:32.630> good<00:05:32.930> at<00:05:33.110> short<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.860> medium<00:05:34.130> range<00:05:34.370> but<00:05:34.610> I

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
it's good at short to medium range but I

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.999 
it's good at short to medium range but I
find<00:05:35.509> just<00:05:35.630> because<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.469> fire<00:05:36.710> rate

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
find just because of the the fire rate

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.059 
find just because of the the fire rate
and<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.669> damage<00:05:37.909> aren't<00:05:38.449> quite<00:05:38.860> you<00:05:39.860> know<00:05:39.949> the

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
and the damage aren't quite you know the

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.529 
and the damage aren't quite you know the
balance<00:05:40.430> of<00:05:40.520> those<00:05:40.699> just<00:05:40.940> doesn't<00:05:41.300> make<00:05:41.389> it

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
balance of those just doesn't make it

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.779 
balance of those just doesn't make it
effective<00:05:41.840> at<00:05:42.169> longer<00:05:42.620> ranges<00:05:42.949> and<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:43.610> can

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
effective at longer ranges and you can

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.269 
effective at longer ranges and you can
pop<00:05:44.000> fire<00:05:44.300> with<00:05:44.810> some<00:05:45.440> of<00:05:45.529> the<00:05:45.590> other<00:05:45.620> SMGs

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 
pop fire with some of the other SMGs

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.399 
pop fire with some of the other SMGs
like<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.520> pp-2000<00:05:47.419> I'm<00:05:47.990> really<00:05:48.289> enjoying

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
like the pp-2000 I'm really enjoying

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.959 
like the pp-2000 I'm really enjoying
that<00:05:48.650> gun<00:05:48.919> somebody<00:05:49.250> had<00:05:49.370> suggested<00:05:49.819> I<00:05:49.909> try

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
that gun somebody had suggested I try

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.209 
that gun somebody had suggested I try
that<00:05:50.389> as<00:05:50.569> an<00:05:50.719> underused<00:05:51.139> underrated<00:05:51.919> weapon

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
that as an underused underrated weapon

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.640 
that as an underused underrated weapon
and<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.550> couldn't<00:05:52.879> agree<00:05:53.060> more<00:05:53.150> as<00:05:53.539> I<00:05:54.139> pop

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
and I couldn't agree more as I pop

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.899 
and I couldn't agree more as I pop
another<00:05:54.889> quick<00:05:55.250> headshot<00:05:55.460> through<00:05:55.849> the

trying<00:06:10.699> to<00:06:10.759> be<00:06:10.849> aggressive<00:06:10.940> you're<00:06:11.419> going<00:06:11.569> to

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
get shot in the back quite a bit so I

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.499 
get shot in the back quite a bit so I
haven't<00:06:13.370> left<00:06:13.550> all<00:06:13.759> of<00:06:13.819> that<00:06:14.060> in<00:06:14.210> there<00:06:14.360> just

that's<00:06:47.129> what<00:06:47.250> I'm<00:06:47.340> going<00:06:47.490> for<00:06:47.580> you<00:06:47.849> know<00:06:47.940> it's

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
that's what I'm going for you know it's

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.719 
that's what I'm going for you know it's
if<00:06:49.349> you're<00:06:49.560> struggling<00:06:49.860> with<00:06:50.099> something<00:06:50.310> you

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
if you're struggling with something you

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.219 
if you're struggling with something you
have<00:06:50.940> to<00:06:50.970> practice<00:06:51.389> it<00:06:51.780> in<00:06:51.870> order<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.110> get

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
have to practice it in order to get

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.140 
have to practice it in order to get
better<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:52.740> you<00:06:53.580> know<00:06:53.669> I<00:06:53.699> think<00:06:53.849> that<00:06:54.120> that

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
better and you know I think that that

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.909 
better and you know I think that that
may<00:06:54.479> be<00:06:54.539> one<00:06:54.840> syndrome<00:06:55.349> of<00:06:55.440> some<00:06:55.620> of<00:06:55.710> the<00:06:55.770> newer

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
may be one syndrome of some of the newer

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.890 
may be one syndrome of some of the newer
players<00:06:56.250> sitting<00:06:56.550> back<00:06:56.789> and<00:06:57.000> sniping<00:06:57.449> is<00:06:57.659> that

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
players sitting back and sniping is that

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.659 
players sitting back and sniping is that
you<00:06:58.259> know<00:06:58.379> if<00:06:58.710> you<00:06:58.889> stay<00:06:59.129> out<00:06:59.250> of<00:06:59.310> harm's<00:06:59.580> way

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
you know if you stay out of harm's way

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.820 
you know if you stay out of harm's way
then<00:07:00.150> bad<00:07:00.599> things<00:07:00.629> don't<00:07:01.110> necessarily<00:07:01.229> happen

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
then bad things don't necessarily happen

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.920 
then bad things don't necessarily happen
to<00:07:02.069> you<00:07:02.159> as<00:07:02.310> much<00:07:02.460> and<00:07:02.759> and<00:07:02.970> I<00:07:03.240> think<00:07:03.270> that<00:07:03.720> you

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
to you as much and and I think that you

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.540 
to you as much and and I think that you
know<00:07:04.020> if<00:07:04.110> you<00:07:04.199> take<00:07:04.409> the<00:07:04.560> time<00:07:04.740> to<00:07:05.099> work<00:07:05.460> on

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
know if you take the time to work on

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.490 
know if you take the time to work on
your<00:07:05.699> reaction<00:07:05.849> work<00:07:06.780> on<00:07:06.900> your<00:07:06.960> gun<00:07:07.199> skills

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
your reaction work on your gun skills

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.529 
your reaction work on your gun skills
then<00:07:07.889> you'll<00:07:08.039> be<00:07:08.159> able<00:07:08.310> to<00:07:08.460> more<00:07:08.909> successfully

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
then you'll be able to more successfully

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.719 
then you'll be able to more successfully
get<00:07:09.690> closer<00:07:09.960> to<00:07:10.169> the<00:07:10.259> action<00:07:10.590> and<00:07:10.770> this<00:07:11.610> is
