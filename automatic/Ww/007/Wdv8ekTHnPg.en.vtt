 asks of course if the allied forces are able to recover after 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.210
 all these attacks and during the last session of the united nations the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.910
 Allied diplomats managed to raise 280 votes against 7 in order to 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.570
 that they can create a unico support fund arming itself is likely

 decisions 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 I do not have commitment it's true 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.360
 but for stalin this is the beginning of the end 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.490

 bravo committed the rest of the world to rebel against him 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.390
 certainly we lost greece 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100
 but we still have resources whatever stalin think because so much 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.189
 that we can count on men as deserving as you are 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 we will bring this war to an end my friend

 one of the damian men 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.310
 she was on a track 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.500
 unfortunately the Russian agents captured him 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 they will most certainly be the man born in Moscow 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.500
 background notes recover it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.510

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 what she has learned can tip the scales in our favor 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.740
 let them recover 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
