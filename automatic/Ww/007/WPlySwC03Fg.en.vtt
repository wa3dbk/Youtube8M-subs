to<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:32.900> shape<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.680> main<00:01:33.860> reason<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:34.280> this

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
to this shape the main reason for this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.880 
to this shape the main reason for this
is<00:01:34.730> that<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.480> gives<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.720> bit<00:01:36.140> more<00:01:36.170> carbon<00:01:36.710> fibre

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
is that it gives a bit more carbon fibre

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.620 
is that it gives a bit more carbon fibre
for<00:01:37.190> any<00:01:37.340> road<00:01:37.550> shot<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.940> be<00:01:38.060> transmitted

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
that the fork has one blade thicker than

asymmetric<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.560> reasoning<00:02:03.980> behind<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.520> is

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
asymmetric the reasoning behind this is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.000 
asymmetric the reasoning behind this is
that<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.150> forces<00:02:05.540> acting<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.500> bicycle

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
that the forces acting on the bicycle

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.979 
that the forces acting on the bicycle
from<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.520> drivetrain<00:02:07.970> being<00:02:08.330> offset<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.899> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
from the drivetrain being offset to the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.449 
from the drivetrain being offset to the
right<00:02:09.140> side<00:02:09.440> stresses<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.250> frame

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
right side stresses the frame

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.009 
right side stresses the frame
differently<00:02:11.030> from<00:02:11.150> side<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.450> side

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
differently from side to side

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.869 
differently from side to side
so<00:02:12.410> what<00:02:12.650> Pinarello<00:02:12.860> has<00:02:13.160> done<00:02:13.370> through<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.700> lot

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879

frame they built that area up by

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.980 
frame they built that area up by
changing<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.820> profile<00:02:20.210> of<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.510> tubing<00:02:20.870> and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
changing the profile of the tubing and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.440 
changing the profile of the tubing and
they've<00:02:21.740> been<00:02:21.860> able<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.130> eliminate<00:02:22.310> weight

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
they've been able to eliminate weight

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.970 
they've been able to eliminate weight
reduce<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.900> size<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.319> other<00:02:24.470> places<00:02:24.709> where

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the stresses aren't quite as high and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.360 
the stresses aren't quite as high and
because<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.200> drivetrain<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.769> offset<00:02:28.160> this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
because the drivetrain is offset this
