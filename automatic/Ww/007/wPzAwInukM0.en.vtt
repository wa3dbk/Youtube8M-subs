second okay so what we have here is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.120 
second okay so what we have here is
actually<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.780> just<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.500> normal<00:01:33.770> high<00:01:33.890> pot

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
actually the the just a normal high pot

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.380 
actually the the just a normal high pot
with<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:34.820> rev<00:01:35.330> software<00:01:35.930> Rev<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.380> kind<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
with the rev software Rev is kind of the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.169 
with the rev software Rev is kind of the
the<00:01:38.390> most<00:01:38.720> basic<00:01:39.140> form<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:40.280> guess<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.030> could

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
the most basic form of I guess you could

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.060 
the most basic form of I guess you could
still<00:01:41.360> call<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:41.869> telemetry<00:01:42.320> Diagnostics

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
still call it like telemetry Diagnostics

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.430 
still call it like telemetry Diagnostics
oh<00:01:43.190> yeah<00:01:43.369> exactly<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:44.330> then<00:01:44.899> here<00:01:45.259> is

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
oh yeah exactly and then here is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.560 
oh yeah exactly and then here is
actually<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.920> device<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.640> need<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.420> a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
actually the device that you need it's a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.260 
actually the device that you need it's a
a<00:01:48.170> Wi-Fi<00:01:49.100> connection<00:01:49.160> so<00:01:49.850> basically<00:01:50.090> it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
a Wi-Fi connection so basically it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.160 
a Wi-Fi connection so basically it
transmits<00:01:50.750> from<00:01:51.590> your<00:01:52.280> ECU<00:01:52.789> with<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> standard

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
transmits from your ECU with a standard

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.260 
transmits from your ECU with a standard
OBT<00:01:54.619> OB<00:01:55.090> will<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.210> d2<00:01:56.570> obd2<00:01:57.140> port<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:59.119> you

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
OBT OB will be d2 obd2 port and then you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.999 
OBT OB will be d2 obd2 port and then you
can<00:01:59.450> connect<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.929> it<00:01:59.960> through<00:02:00.380> your<00:02:00.470> ipod<00:02:00.830> with

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
can connect to it through your ipod with

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.889 
can connect to it through your ipod with
a<00:02:01.039> past<00:02:01.340> password<00:02:02.149> password<00:02:02.330> yes

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
a past password password yes

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.660 
a past password password yes
so<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.530> Knight<00:02:03.890> Rider<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.399> could<00:02:04.550> just

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
so like Knight Rider you could just

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.520 
so like Knight Rider you could just
drive<00:02:04.789> my<00:02:04.970> other<00:02:05.119> cars<00:02:05.420> otherwise<00:02:05.750> no<00:02:06.170> no<00:02:06.229> and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
drive my other cars otherwise no no and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.559 
drive my other cars otherwise no no and
you<00:02:06.770> could<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.130> need<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> password<00:02:07.610> but<00:02:08.149> how

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
you could you need a password but how

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.449 
you could you need a password but how
much<00:02:08.720> does<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:08.989> cable<00:02:09.319> cost<00:02:09.470> about<00:02:09.649> $100<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
much does this cable cost about $100 you

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.610 
much does this cable cost about $100 you
remember<00:02:10.789> my<00:02:11.060> old<00:02:11.090> Audi<00:02:11.420> s4<00:02:11.900> you're<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.380> but

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
remember my old Audi s4 you're the but

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.370 
remember my old Audi s4 you're the but
before<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.340> have<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.640> be<00:02:13.730> fun<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.989> was<00:02:15.170> like<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
before you have to be fun it was like a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.479 
before you have to be fun it was like a
$500<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> bag<00:02:16.730> -<00:02:17.150> yeah<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.800> laptop<00:02:19.310> is

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
$500 a bag - yeah and so the laptop is

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.910 
$500 a bag - yeah and so the laptop is
bulky<00:02:19.940> there<00:02:20.150> was<00:02:20.330> also<00:02:20.750> condemned<00:02:21.200> pc-based

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
bulky there was also condemned pc-based

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.910 
bulky there was also condemned pc-based
need<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.550> serial<00:02:23.030> port<00:02:23.290> rs-232<00:02:24.290> yeah<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:24.830> this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
need a serial port rs-232 yeah so this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.770 
need a serial port rs-232 yeah so this
is<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.130> huge<00:02:25.310> step<00:02:25.580> forward<00:02:25.849> very<00:02:26.180> very<00:02:26.270> good

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
is a huge step forward very very good

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.449 
is a huge step forward very very good
support<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.040> thing<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.370> to

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
support and and the thing you have to

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.530 
support and and the thing you have to
remember<00:02:28.520> though<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.239> only<00:02:29.390> works

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
remember though is that this only works

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.380 
remember though is that this only works
on<00:02:29.900> cars<00:02:30.200> built<00:02:30.620> after<00:02:30.800> 2000<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.879> guess<00:02:32.239> there

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
on cars built after 2000 I guess there

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.750 
on cars built after 2000 I guess there
was<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.540> limitation<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.220> 2008

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
was a limitation of and this is a 2008

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.740 
was a limitation of and this is a 2008
that<00:02:35.239> works<00:02:35.420> perfectly<00:02:35.930> okay

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.280 

okay

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
okay

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.179 
okay
hora<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.159> running<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.470> Wi-Fi<00:02:44.920> signal

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
hora is running so that's a Wi-Fi signal

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.800 
hora is running so that's a Wi-Fi signal
that's<00:02:45.489> now<00:02:45.670> being<00:02:45.849> transmitted<00:02:46.390> what<00:02:46.659> we've

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that's now being transmitted what we've

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.839 
that's now being transmitted what we've
done<00:02:46.989> here<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.319> we've<00:02:47.470> connected<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
done here is we've connected the the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.990 
done here is we've connected the the
Kiwi<00:02:49.239> wireless<00:02:49.840> port<00:02:50.110> we've<00:02:50.829> connected<00:02:51.189> via

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
Kiwi wireless port we've connected via

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.580 
Kiwi wireless port we've connected via
Wi-Fi<00:02:52.829> on<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.099> iPod<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> car<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.170> now<00:02:56.319> what

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
Wi-Fi on the iPod to the car so now what

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.069 
Wi-Fi on the iPod to the car so now what
we<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.430> full<00:02:58.150> access<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.810> car's

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
we can have is full access to the car's

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.920 
we can have is full access to the car's
ECU<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.860> just<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:00.730> clear<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.329> can<00:03:01.750> have

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
ECU and just so I'm clear I can have

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.170 
ECU and just so I'm clear I can have
this<00:03:02.019> running<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:02.739> while<00:03:03.340> I'm<00:03:03.610> driving<00:03:03.879> it

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
this running and while I'm driving it

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.930 
this running and while I'm driving it
exactly<00:03:04.360> any<00:03:04.810> time<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.549> range<00:03:06.700> of

program now what we have here is we have
it<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.299> can't<00:03:34.510> go<00:03:34.659> driving<00:03:34.930> right<00:03:35.170> now<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.950> we

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it we can't go driving right now but we

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.180 
it we can't go driving right now but we
have<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.579> track<00:03:37.030> from<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.560> last<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.950> drive

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
have a track from the last the drive

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.220 
have a track from the last the drive
from<00:03:39.340> Daytona<00:03:39.670> yes<00:03:39.879> yes<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.420> don't<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.690> see<00:03:40.930> I

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
from Daytona yes yes you don't you see I

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.030 
from Daytona yes yes you don't you see I
did<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> zero<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:41.950> sixty<00:03:42.250> will<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
did a zero to sixty will you

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.920 
did a zero to sixty will you
full<00:03:43.610> throttle<00:03:43.879> is<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.330> speed<00:03:44.599> and<00:03:44.720> left

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
full throttle is that speed and left

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.830 
full throttle is that speed and left
speed<00:03:45.680> isn't<00:03:45.980> good<00:03:46.159> yeah<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.299> you've<00:03:47.629> got

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
speed isn't good yeah so you've got
