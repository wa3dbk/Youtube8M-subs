00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.310 
but I think if you play teams you wear
the<00:01:31.729> same<00:01:32.060> hat<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.689> that's<00:01:32.840> how<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.110> know

like<00:01:54.500> Cowboys<00:01:55.310> doing<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.759> shootout<00:01:56.090> sometimes

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
like Cowboys doing a shootout sometimes

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.660 
like Cowboys doing a shootout sometimes
like<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.439> first<00:01:57.740> guy<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.950> run<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.520> gun

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
like the first guy to run to the gun

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.040 
like the first guy to run to the gun
pick<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.000> up<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.300> hit<00:01:59.420> X<00:02:00.280> wins<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.720> just<00:02:02.869> like

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
pick it up and hit X wins it's just like

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.370 
pick it up and hit X wins it's just like
really<00:02:03.440> fast<00:02:03.909> yeah<00:02:04.909> but<00:02:05.630> one<00:02:05.869> thing<00:02:06.020> once<00:02:06.289> you

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
really fast yeah but one thing once you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.009 
really fast yeah but one thing once you
get<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> hang<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:06.920> I'm<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.490> am<00:02:08.030> pretty<00:02:08.660> bad

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
get a hang of it I'm I am pretty bad

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.559 
get a hang of it I'm I am pretty bad
though<00:02:09.489> this<00:02:10.489> is<00:02:10.729> like<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.090> played<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> whole

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
though this is like I played a whole

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.800 
though this is like I played a whole
bunch<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.900> games<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.850> think<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.180> best<00:02:14.600> I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
bunch of games and I think the best I

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.500 
bunch of games and I think the best I
did<00:02:15.049> was<00:02:15.290> maybe<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.799> second<00:02:16.250> place<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.970> I

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
did was maybe like second place and I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.820 
did was maybe like second place and I
was<00:02:17.600> still<00:02:17.810> probably<00:02:18.019> 5<00:02:18.380> points<00:02:18.709> behind

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
was still probably 5 points behind

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.759 
was still probably 5 points behind
basically<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.819> first<00:02:19.850> person<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:21.560> get

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
basically it's the first person to get

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.530 
basically it's the first person to get
up<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.069> 10<00:02:22.430> wins<00:02:22.760> wins<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.290> match<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.790> you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
up to 10 wins wins like the match so you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.910 
up to 10 wins wins like the match so you
know<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:27.019> takes<00:02:27.170> quite<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.440> while<00:02:27.560> often

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
know that takes quite a while often

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.890 
know that takes quite a while often
you'll<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.430> everyone<00:02:29.030> dies<00:02:29.239> if<00:02:29.510> or<00:02:29.720> two

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
you'll have everyone dies if or two

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.420 
you'll have everyone dies if or two
people<00:02:30.170> die<00:02:30.290> at<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.470> same<00:02:30.620> time<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.220> no

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
people die at the same time so that no

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.190 
people die at the same time so that no
one<00:02:31.549> gets<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.820> point<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.780> only<00:02:32.989> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
one gets a point and it's only the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.720 
one gets a point and it's only the
winner<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.500> gets<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.890> point<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.519> know

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
winner that gets a point so you know

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.330 
winner that gets a point so you know
even<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.269> you've<00:02:35.930> killed<00:02:36.290> two<00:02:36.440> people<00:02:36.799> but

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
even if you've killed two people but

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.130 
even if you've killed two people but
then<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.579> lose<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.239> don't<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.540> any<00:02:38.780> like

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
then you lose you don't get any like

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.490 
then you lose you don't get any like
reward<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.510> yeah<00:02:41.510> these<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.959> tend<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.350> be

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
reward for it so yeah these I tend to be

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.319 
reward for it so yeah these I tend to be
better<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.829> these<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.190> larger<00:02:43.640> Maps<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.060> think

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
better on these like larger Maps I think

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.330 
better on these like larger Maps I think
it<00:02:45.019> gives<00:02:45.170> me<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> bit<00:02:45.560> more<00:02:45.590> time<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.160> like

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it gives me a bit more time to like

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.900 
it gives me a bit more time to like
think<00:02:47.500> yeah<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.680> jetpack<00:02:49.160> one<00:02:49.340> was<00:02:49.519> crazy<00:02:49.760> I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
think yeah the jetpack one was crazy I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.030 
think yeah the jetpack one was crazy I
thought<00:02:50.209> I'd<00:02:50.359> totally<00:02:50.600> had<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.109> guy<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.739> was

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
thought I'd totally had this guy I was

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.780 
thought I'd totally had this guy I was
like<00:02:52.420> hi<00:02:53.709> yeah<00:02:54.709> I'm<00:02:55.160> still<00:02:55.430> learning<00:02:55.730> the

like hi yeah I'm still learning the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.310 
like hi yeah I'm still learning the
mechanics<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.420> see<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.660> turned<00:02:56.720> him<00:02:57.079> into<00:02:57.230> a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
mechanics the see I turned him into a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.560 
mechanics the see I turned him into a
little<00:02:57.680> ice<00:02:58.190> cube<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.910> thought<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.120> had<00:02:59.359> them

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
learn new things every match which I

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.160 
learn new things every match which I
good<00:03:08.290> very<00:03:08.680> frustrating<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.340> put<00:03:09.459> kid<00:03:10.170> yeah

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
little things I don't know how to light

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.160 
little things I don't know how to light
fire<00:03:15.249> and<00:03:15.579> stuff<00:03:15.819> yet<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.659> can<00:03:16.780> like<00:03:16.930> throw

fire and stuff yet you can like throw
weapons<00:03:17.709> too<00:03:17.950> sometimes<00:03:18.549> they<00:03:18.700> kill<00:03:18.909> people

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
weapons too sometimes they kill people

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.819 
weapons too sometimes they kill people
like<00:03:19.480> swords<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.139> throw<00:03:22.230> half<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.439> guns<00:03:23.650> I

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
like swords you throw half the guns I

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.229 
like swords you throw half the guns I
end<00:03:24.040> up<00:03:24.099> killing<00:03:24.310> myself<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.849> first<00:03:24.969> time<00:03:25.150> I

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
end up killing myself the first time I

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.849 
end up killing myself the first time I
use<00:03:25.389> them<00:03:25.569> like<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:25.959> map<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.500> think<00:03:26.769> I'm

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
use them like this map I think I'm

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.640 
use them like this map I think I'm
always<00:03:27.040> killing<00:03:27.340> myself<00:03:27.549> on<00:03:27.879> it<00:03:28.409> this<00:03:29.409> guy

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
always killing myself on it this guy

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.349 
always killing myself on it this guy
here<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> think<00:03:30.310> that's<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.549> shield<00:03:30.909> that<00:03:31.209> he's

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
here I think that's a shield that he's

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.860 
here I think that's a shield that he's
using<00:03:31.750> he's<00:03:31.930> just<00:03:32.139> being<00:03:32.319> cheap<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:33.159> I<00:03:33.870> was

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
using he's just being cheap so I was

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.599 
using he's just being cheap so I was
like<00:03:35.049> trying<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.650> figure<00:03:35.859> out<00:03:36.040> how<00:03:36.159> to<00:03:36.219> get<00:03:36.430> him

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
like trying to figure out how to get him

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.890 
like trying to figure out how to get him
like<00:03:36.849> me<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.299> go<00:03:37.389> round<00:03:37.629> it<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.079> long<00:03:38.409> way<00:03:38.650> but

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
like me and go round it a long way but
