00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:47.420 

it<00:00:35.400> looks<00:00:35.550> pretty<00:00:35.790> nice

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.980 

yeah<00:00:48.430> it's<00:00:48.790> pretty<00:00:49.030> pretty<00:00:49.900> reflective<00:00:50.230> still

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.100 

I<00:00:58.020> still<00:00:58.650> need<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.830> get<00:00:58.950> this<00:00:59.040> window<00:00:59.280> tinted

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
I still need to get this window tinted

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.230 
I still need to get this window tinted
it's<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.170> only<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.560> not<00:01:01.650> tinted<00:01:02.240> got

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
it's the only one that's not tinted got

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.320 
it's the only one that's not tinted got
it<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> though<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.990> don't<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.500> if

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.530 

it<00:01:09.690> was<00:01:09.810> broken<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.230> or<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.980> tensest<00:01:11.370> was

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
it was broken into or if the tensest was

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.940 
it was broken into or if the tensest was
fading<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.870> stripped<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
fading so they stripped it off or I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.020 
fading so they stripped it off or I
don't

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.930 

I<00:01:20.060> like<00:01:21.020> these<00:01:21.200> wheels<00:01:21.410> too<00:01:21.740> man<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.730> type

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
I like these wheels too man the type

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.020 
I like these wheels too man the type
best<00:01:23.150> wheels<00:01:24.010> got<00:01:25.010> a<00:01:25.070> little<00:01:25.310> ding<00:01:25.520> couple

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
best wheels got a little ding couple

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
best wheels got a little ding couple
dings<00:01:26.180> on<00:01:26.390> them<00:01:26.510> but<00:01:26.600> for<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> most<00:01:26.960> part

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
dings on them but for the most part

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.910 
dings on them but for the most part
they're<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:27.380> good<00:01:27.470> shape<00:01:29.590> yeah<00:01:30.590> these<00:01:30.710> are<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
they're in good shape yeah these are the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:41.560 
they're in good shape yeah these are the
type<00:01:31.100> s<00:01:31.280> wheels<00:01:31.550> for<00:01:31.760> 2003

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.510 

so<00:01:42.170> here's<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.960> motor<00:01:45.010> for<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:47.170> type<00:01:48.170> s

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
so here's the motor for the type s

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.380 
so here's the motor for the type s
accuracy<00:01:49.520> oh<00:01:50.770> it's<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.830> 3.2<00:01:52.430> liter<00:01:52.460> VTEC<00:01:52.880> J

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
accuracy oh it's a 3.2 liter VTEC J

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.500 
accuracy oh it's a 3.2 liter VTEC J
series<00:01:53.780> motor<00:01:54.100> j32

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
series motor j32

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.400 
series motor j32
originally<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.540> thought<00:01:56.870> it<00:01:56.960> was<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.170> same

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
originally I thought it was the same

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.880 
originally I thought it was the same
engine<00:01:57.740> as<00:01:58.160> a<00:01:58.480> what<00:01:59.480> they<00:01:59.570> had<00:01:59.690> in<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.870> NSX<00:02:00.350> but

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
engine as a what they had in the NSX but

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.950 
engine as a what they had in the NSX but
it<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:02.180> happens<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.540> be<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.780> same

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
it just just happens to be the same

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.020 
it just just happens to be the same
liter<00:02:03.650> displacement<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.670> know<00:02:04.790> for<00:02:04.970> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
liter displacement you know for the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.360 
liter displacement you know for the
later<00:02:05.210> models<00:02:05.620> 3.2<00:02:06.620> liters<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.010> it's<00:02:07.160> not<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
later models 3.2 liters but it's not the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.150 
later models 3.2 liters but it's not the
same<00:02:07.550> engine<00:02:07.910> by<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.690> way<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.899> did<00:02:09.140> put<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.350> K&amp;N

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
same engine by the way I did put a K&amp;N

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.750 
same engine by the way I did put a K&amp;N
filter<00:02:11.470> stock<00:02:12.470> replacement<00:02:13.070> filter<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
filter stock replacement filter in the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.850 
filter stock replacement filter in the
stock<00:02:14.000> airbox<00:02:14.209> which<00:02:15.110> I've<00:02:15.290> actually<00:02:15.470> noticed

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
stock airbox which I've actually noticed

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.250 
stock airbox which I've actually noticed
does<00:02:16.670> give<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> little<00:02:17.390> bit<00:02:17.510> more<00:02:17.720> power<00:02:17.930> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
does give a little bit more power and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.300 
does give a little bit more power and
definitely<00:02:19.160> better<00:02:19.459> gas<00:02:19.670> mileage<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:21.310> also

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
definitely better gas mileage and also

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.030 
definitely better gas mileage and also
the<00:02:23.270> RPM<00:02:23.690> seemed<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.230> sit<00:02:25.160> lower<00:02:26.920> when<00:02:27.920> you're

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the RPM seemed to sit lower when you're

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.380 
the RPM seemed to sit lower when you're
cruising<00:02:28.430> like<00:02:28.550> on<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.730> highway<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.180> stuff

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
cruising like on the highway and stuff

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.040 
cruising like on the highway and stuff
so<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:31.640> definitely<00:02:32.060> recommended<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:32.900> like

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
so I definitely recommended it was like

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.770 
so I definitely recommended it was like
60<00:02:33.590> bucks<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:33.980> think<00:02:34.160> 50<00:02:34.430> bucks<00:02:34.640> 50<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.030> 60<00:02:35.390> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
60 bucks I think 50 bucks 50 to 60 and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.479 
60 bucks I think 50 bucks 50 to 60 and
you<00:02:36.410> never<00:02:36.530> have<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.709> replace<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.310> just

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
you never have to replace it you just

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.630 
you never have to replace it you just
have<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.730> clean<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.200> every<00:02:39.200> 50,000<00:02:40.190> miles<00:02:40.370> or

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
have to clean it every 50,000 miles or

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.990 
have to clean it every 50,000 miles or
so<00:02:40.850> that's<00:02:41.300> what<00:02:41.450> they<00:02:41.540> recommend<00:02:42.760> unless<00:02:43.760> you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
so that's what they recommend unless you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.160 
so that's what they recommend unless you
live<00:02:44.150> somewhere<00:02:44.390> where<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.660> really<00:02:44.900> dirty

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
live somewhere where it's really dirty

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.050 
live somewhere where it's really dirty
