00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
here they didn't get to completely think

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.900 
here they didn't get to completely think
either<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:37.990> some<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.370> bit<00:02:39.760> more

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
either so some of this is a bit more

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.340

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.170 
think that those in the back of your
head<00:03:35.500> or<00:03:35.620> something<00:03:35.800> but<00:03:36.640> I'm<00:03:36.850> not<00:03:36.880> really

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
head or something but I'm not really

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.300 
head or something but I'm not really
sure<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.750> used<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.320> good<00:03:38.530> amount<00:03:38.740> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.010> Manic

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
sure I used a good amount of the Manic

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.090 
sure I used a good amount of the Manic
Panic<00:03:39.459> hair<00:03:39.850> dye<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.660> bottle<00:03:41.020> so<00:03:41.709> either<00:03:41.920> I

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
Panic hair dye in the bottle so either I

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.350 
Panic hair dye in the bottle so either I
just<00:03:42.459> don't<00:03:42.640> know<00:03:42.760> how<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.910> make<00:03:43.090> very<00:03:43.300> good

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
just don't know how to make very good

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.130 
just don't know how to make very good
use<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.660> it

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
use of it

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.990 
use of it
or<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.530> probably<00:03:44.980> would<00:03:45.190> need<00:03:45.340> more<00:03:45.489> bottles<00:03:45.880> if

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
or I probably would need more bottles if

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.180 
or I probably would need more bottles if
I<00:03:46.090> were<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.300> die<00:03:46.450> all<00:03:46.810> these<00:03:47.050> extensions<00:03:47.410> but

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
I were to die all these extensions but

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.770 
I were to die all these extensions but
you<00:03:48.489> can<00:03:48.610> see<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.270> cover<00:03:49.450> they<00:03:49.630> got

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
you can see this is the cover they got

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.510 
you can see this is the cover they got
before<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.110> die<00:03:50.260> them<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.770> this<00:03:51.220> supposed<00:03:51.489> to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
before you die them so this supposed to

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.580 
before you die them so this supposed to
be<00:03:51.640> kind<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.820> like<00:03:51.970> white<00:03:52.270> cloth<00:03:52.900> extensions

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
be kind of like white cloth extensions

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.910 
be kind of like white cloth extensions
and<00:03:53.830> then<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.160> dyed<00:03:54.400> them<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:54.970> yeah<00:03:55.420> or<00:03:56.410> trying

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
and then I dyed them so yeah or trying

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.729 
and then I dyed them so yeah or trying
to<00:03:57.070> dye<00:03:57.580> them<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.989> then<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.320> other<00:03:59.500> good

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
to dye them and then the other good

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.199 
to dye them and then the other good
thing<00:03:59.950> about<00:04:00.190> these<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.670> actually<00:04:01.060> came

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
thing about these is it actually came

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.850 
thing about these is it actually came
with<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.420> bunch<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.750> these<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.140> extra<00:04:02.590> clips

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
with a bunch of these like extra clips

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.180 
with a bunch of these like extra clips
so<00:04:03.580> if<00:04:03.760> any<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.030> your<00:04:04.150> clips<00:04:04.330> break<00:04:04.570> off<00:04:04.750> then

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
so if any of your clips break off then

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.160 
so if any of your clips break off then
these<00:04:06.190> extra<00:04:06.670> clips<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.300> that's<00:04:07.570> really<00:04:07.840> cool

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
these extra clips so that's really cool

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.070 
these extra clips so that's really cool
so<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.890> was<00:04:09.100> me<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.610> guess<00:04:09.820> attempting<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.810> dye

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
so that was me I guess attempting to dye

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.410 
so that was me I guess attempting to dye
my<00:04:11.560> hair<00:04:11.590> extensions<00:04:12.340> no<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:12.880> didn't<00:04:13.269> really

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
my hair extensions no I didn't really

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.180 
my hair extensions no I didn't really
need<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:14.080> do<00:04:14.170> exactly<00:04:14.620> what<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.739> was<00:04:14.890> intending

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
need to do exactly what I was intending

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.130 
need to do exactly what I was intending
with<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.940> maybe<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.570> didn't<00:04:16.900> do<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
with you and maybe I didn't do the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.830 
with you and maybe I didn't do the
perfect<00:04:17.410> job<00:04:17.769> tying<00:04:18.070> them<00:04:18.489> but<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.209> did<00:04:19.450> try<00:04:19.660> it

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
perfect job tying them but I did try it

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.690 
perfect job tying them but I did try it
and<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.169> think<00:04:20.410> they<00:04:20.530> came<00:04:20.650> up<00:04:20.829> Oh<00:04:20.980> anyway<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:21.669> I

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
and I think they came up Oh anyway so I

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.120 
and I think they came up Oh anyway so I
guess<00:04:22.090> that's<00:04:22.390> about<00:04:22.630> this<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.500> expendables

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
guess that's about this the expendables

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.940 
guess that's about this the expendables
themselves<00:04:24.580> are<00:04:24.729> really<00:04:25.030> nice<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.510> I
