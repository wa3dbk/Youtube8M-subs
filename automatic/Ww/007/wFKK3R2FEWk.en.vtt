 and potential analyzes and development 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 In addition, if and offends processes 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 The coaches can page out

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.330
 No so far 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.480
 with a go 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.660
 professionalism 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.920
 you do not want to comment on it 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.250
 every single one of our trainer and coach Kotaska from side 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.310
 unqualified 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.930
 and specialized 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.180
 not only a well-founded education and a study of the subject 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.970
 Special cases smoked themselves had vain do 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.159
 emphasize 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.920
 Nena Euro have been invested 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.440
 the mz-editorial 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.970
 transactional analysis 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.100
 but to hear it 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.120
 Vogelsang is divided 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.120
 the face is an essential success factor for me 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 each of our team knows on its own 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.829
 what he is talking about when a seamless training kick-off 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.750
 Vienna immediate solutions 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.880
 Speaking of solutions 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.700
 they specialize in the subject of box what is ours 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.180
 but it is another new edition is Fachbuches customer loyalty 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.240
 is the subtitle of the book 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.269
 FOMA Rotterdam to successful customer partnership 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.269
 the time of the patient is really over 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.509
 Brussels continues 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.579
 define the hair cells 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.530
 For example, in the 1980s 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.969
 it was considered set almost blank 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.159
 With the least possible effort, yes back from customers 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.569
 rhetorical tricks with manipulation this ran up deep 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.929
 exaggerated hardness at graduation 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.079
 or something like that 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.359
 buys a compact customer 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.359
 the customer of Alonso to order them too 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.389
 if you define that as a godmother 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.989
 my answer is quite clear 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 this time as far as service came to an end 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.809
 no matter in which function 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:55.349
 are the essential today 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.689
 Differentiate authors 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.419
 informed 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.629
 unfortunately also uncompromising 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.519
 uncompromising 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.439
 that is in terms of 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.569
 by no means 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.749
 it is completely wrong to assume 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.980
 the customer request can go out for the cheapest price 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.049
 always like that and will certainly always be like that 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.049
 the price is always in proportion 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.260
 and right here 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
 differ the successful sellers and companies 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.659
 from the others 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.889
 buy processes 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.779
 Processes and sales talks 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.679
 standardized 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.219
 that go with you 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.859
 most important employee of a company 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.089
 barely properly explained 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:45.649
 namely the customer 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.889
 to question again and again 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.589
 what can i mean for mine 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.579
 what are his real needs 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.259
 and even go a step further 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.399
 to ask the question consistently and self-critically 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.399
 what would the world and my customers lack 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.809
 or do not give my company 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.859
 sometimes there was the answer 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.859
 but this thought process Salvator 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.269
 it is called 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.199
 to do everything for the customer 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.259
 the Westphalia 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.389
 to give profound no 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.889
 to submit to him 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.270
 what really moves her 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.490
 to really care about his customers 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.110
 the customer is satisfied 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.110
 Goal of this 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 not the slightest example of doing programs 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.729
 "We all see ourselves as a reliable partner 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.520
 to their responsibility 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.740
 and that shows up very well already 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.229
 in the products 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.779
 in the article 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.509
 in the conversation during the sales pitch 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.050
 in the US underlined very clearly 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.599
 even without a degree 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.059
 passionate 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.879
 for the federal government 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.379
 to go to the bottom 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.789
 in mutual benefit 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.499
 Honestly 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:05.779
 trusting 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.409
 and engaged 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.409
 the 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.370
 for us is 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.839
 She trains and coaches herself 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:13.639
 Seller 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.659
 for a short time 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.659
 What do you expect from your participants? 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:22.780
 proud

 this task will be proud 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.499
 because only cheap strong sales and sellers 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:38.969

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.460
