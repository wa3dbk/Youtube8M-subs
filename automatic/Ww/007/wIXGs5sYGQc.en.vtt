this<00:01:05.110> one's<00:01:05.350> particularly<00:01:05.860> because<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.280> they

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
this one's particularly because of they

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.730

haven't been in Oklahoma to still the
game<00:01:10.020> let's<00:01:11.020> really<00:01:11.229> hope<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.530> offense<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979

most<00:01:12.159> invisible

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
most invisible

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.149 
most invisible
I<00:01:13.330> think<00:01:13.659> our<00:01:13.720> ball<00:01:13.900> movement<00:01:14.140> over<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:14.950> ball

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
I think our ball movement over the ball

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.789 
I think our ball movement over the ball
sharing<00:01:15.549> there<00:01:15.940> was<00:01:16.060> one<00:01:16.210> another<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.680> know

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799
