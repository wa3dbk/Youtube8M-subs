00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 This is an Israeli brand which is known 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.380
 natural argan 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.840
 oil is a valuable tool for 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
 hair care containing great 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 amount of vitamins and nutritional 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 substances and so what is interesting given 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.210
 product it can be used for 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.980
 styling or without styling 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.910
 but it is always necessary to use on 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.129
 clean hair because small 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.789
 weighting when applying this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.189
 hair means exists and so hair 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.439
 did not have 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.580
 dirty and untidy look to use 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.640
 its only necessary on clean hair 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.030
 besides giving the hair shine this 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.880
 remedy also contribute 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.130
 antistatic effect eliminates 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.040
 excessive electrified hair makes 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.509
 hair compliant when combing 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.729
 further so for example if you have not 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.189
 fixed masonry just uncool 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.030
 hair during the day they will be easier 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:41.070
 comb except this means 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 protects hair when combing without giving 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.380
 he break and split 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.009
 in shimmer spray 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.220
 included moisturizing caregivers 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.939
 components and of course a large percentage 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.500
 is up 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.970
 naturally argan 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.720
 oil and so how to use the data 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.420
 this tool after you washed 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.940
 her head was dried and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.540
 either styled your hair or 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.020
 just want to highlight the brilliance of your 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.230
 hair distance 15-20 centimeters per 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.520
 put a spray on the bottom and give it 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700
 dry up a little 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.750
 Again, I repeat the excessive application 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.370
 means undesirable that is, first 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.880
 hair look can be very beautiful and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.120
