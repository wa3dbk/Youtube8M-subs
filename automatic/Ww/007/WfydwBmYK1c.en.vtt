getting<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.739> map<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.460> very

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
getting of this map is that it's very

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.360 
getting of this map is that it's very
very<00:00:36.149> spacious<00:00:36.870> even<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.710> possibly<00:00:38.160> than

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
very spacious even more so possibly than

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.770 
very spacious even more so possibly than
containments<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:41.160> former<00:00:41.550> map

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
containments because in the former map

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
containments because in the former map
you<00:00:42.780> basically<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.559> stay<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.460> outer

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you basically have to stay on the outer

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.850 
you basically have to stay on the outer
edges<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.420> avoid<00:00:46.079> being<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> center<00:00:46.710> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
say in the open too long and here is a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
say in the open too long and here is a
shipwreck<00:01:09.659> seemingly<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> middle<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> the

shipwreck seemingly in the middle of the
crash<00:01:11.310> site<00:01:11.580> map<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.119> sure<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
crash site map I'm not sure if it's

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.240 
crash site map I'm not sure if it's
exactly<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> middle<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> good

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
exactly the middle but it's a good

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
exactly the middle but it's a good
estimate<00:01:14.490> kind<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
estimate kind of like how there's a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.679 
estimate kind of like how there's a
shipwreck<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.460> edge<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.000> piledriver

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the edge of that map so they'll quickly

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
the edge of that map so they'll quickly

zillow is known for his exceptional aim
and<00:02:10.459> I'm<00:02:11.090> thinking<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.019> ps4<00:02:12.349> version

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040

and I'm thinking that on the ps4 version
he<00:02:13.640> has<00:02:13.760> even<00:02:14.030> higher<00:02:14.360> kill<00:02:14.660> counts<00:02:14.959> because

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
he has even higher kill counts because

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.460 
he has even higher kill counts because
of<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.340> aim<00:02:16.819> assist<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.390> auto-aim<00:02:17.690> that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
of the aim assist the auto-aim that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.140 
of the aim assist the auto-aim that
consoles<00:02:18.920> naturally<00:02:19.459> give<00:02:19.640> most<00:02:19.879> of<00:02:20.000> their

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150

shooters<00:02:20.510> I've<00:02:21.290> never<00:02:21.470> really<00:02:21.709> understood

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
shooters I've never really understood

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.640 
shooters I've never really understood
why<00:02:22.459> console<00:02:22.910> shooters<00:02:23.060> give<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.989> auto<00:02:24.379> aim

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
why console shooters give you auto aim

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.890 
why console shooters give you auto aim
is<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.760> because<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.150> too<00:02:26.300> hard<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.569> aim<00:02:26.750> with

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
is it because it's too hard to aim with

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
is it because it's too hard to aim with
the<00:02:26.959> controller<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.560> don't<00:02:28.099> think<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.519> because

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
the controller I don't think so because

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.559 
the controller I don't think so because
I've<00:02:29.150> seen<00:02:29.180> people<00:02:29.540> use<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:31.150> xbox<00:02:32.150> controller

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
I've seen people use a xbox controller

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.210 
I've seen people use a xbox controller
for<00:02:32.959> pc<00:02:33.230> shooters<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:33.920> seem<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.129> be

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
for pc shooters and they seem to be

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.140 
for pc shooters and they seem to be
doing<00:02:34.370> fine<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:37.250> thinking<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.910> if

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
doing fine so I'm thinking that if

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.270 
doing fine so I'm thinking that if
console<00:02:38.870> shooters<00:02:39.049> actually<00:02:39.830> took<00:02:39.980> away

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
console shooters actually took away

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.430 
console shooters actually took away
their<00:02:40.430> auto<00:02:40.580> aim<00:02:40.900> people<00:02:41.900> would<00:02:42.049> have<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> much

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
their auto aim people would have a much

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.890 
their auto aim people would have a much
harder<00:02:42.650> time<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:44.180> I'm<00:02:44.269> just<00:02:44.420> theoretically

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
harder time but I'm just theoretically

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.800 
harder time but I'm just theoretically
speaking<00:02:45.200> because<00:02:45.590> personally<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.400> cannot<00:02:47.299> use

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
speaking because personally I cannot use

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
speaking because personally I cannot use
a<00:02:47.840> controller<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.680> aim<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:49.069> save<00:02:49.250> my<00:02:49.400> life<00:02:49.610> I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
a controller to aim to save my life I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.970 
a controller to aim to save my life I
have<00:02:50.209> tried<00:02:50.540> numerous<00:02:51.019> times<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.890> has

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
have tried numerous times and it has

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.069 
have tried numerous times and it has
always<00:02:52.160> felt<00:02:52.430> awkward<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.120> think<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:53.870> i<00:02:53.989> am

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079

straight<00:03:10.549> across<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> lot<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.720> people

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
straight across it not a lot of people

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.180 
been told use a RS and smgs with toxic
ammo<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:24.290> maybe<00:03:24.470> that's<00:03:24.769> why<00:03:24.950> we're<00:03:25.100> not

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
ammo so maybe that's why we're not

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.670 
ammo so maybe that's why we're not
seeing<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.489> lot<00:03:25.639> of<00:03:25.750> receiver<00:03:26.750> variety<00:03:27.410> here
