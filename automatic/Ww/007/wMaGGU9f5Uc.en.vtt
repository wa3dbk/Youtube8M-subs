00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.720
 making faux leather with something 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.649
 reminds 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:12.120
 creating a newspaper in both cases is needed 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.750
 printing machine paper and paint but the most 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.859
 the main thing is to have a creative team 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 it is he who determines the content 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.090
 products, that is, from what ingredients 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.800
 there will be another batch of leather 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.240
 new composition is being developed in a small 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.920
 labs are truly creative torments 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.460
 then from these components do shaft 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 equestrian base in leather production she 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.320
 as important as paper to make 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.379
 newspapers 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 the analogy with paper is not random 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.450
 it is on her when creating leatherette 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.449
 special substance is applied paper 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.020
 unusual and at times more expensive than a newspaper or 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.489
 magazines 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.960
 up to 12 thousand euros per roll so to her 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.750
 applies especially carefully 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.480
 so as not torn unwound on 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.460
 special device compensator 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.740
 for the same reasons so as not to spoil 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 expensive material before manufacture 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.140
 the whole lot make a prototype 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.750
 we have 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.830
 but 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.980
 first of all it is tested for strength 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.040
 a piece of skin is torn up on a special 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.900
 These test machines showed that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.950
 probe is able to withstand 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.280
 80 newton means the whole party is enough 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.190
 firmly then skin needs good 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.710
 rub the whole day she exposed 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.940
 tests in a special Italian car 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.970
 which is called morph gave 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.790
 but this is not the end of all the torture next 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:28.070
 stage on a piece of skin rolled in 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.620
 a tube is placed on the side of the scale it 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.030
 tiny iron balls are weighing in 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.770
 only 1 gram of product must withstand 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.770
 15 of these balls and do not bend 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.450
 our prototype passed everything with honor 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.379
 tests can now be run 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.840
 conveyor 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.849
 first thing on special paper 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.930
 lab born cause 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.409
 liquid substance future skin and and need 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.950
 upload 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.189
 special apparatus using a pump a 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.439
 from there 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:07.689
 apply evenly to paper and 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.689
 send to the oven to dry 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.770
 following skin machine evenly 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.120
 smeared with glue which then impose 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.410
 the fabric is like heat resistant glue 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.500
 as it must withstand further 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.630
 oven treatment at 180 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.890
 degrees 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.400
 the process is under scrutiny 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.840
 supervising the supervisors one oversees 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.800
 so as not to run out of cloth and 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.630
 periodically changes roll and other 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.140
 check their thickness and quality at the end 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 canvas 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.760
 and the slightest glitch report right from 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.760
 jobs on the radio 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.650
 the product is almost ready again 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.100
 warmed in the oven and then taken out and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.620
 peel off that skin and its foundation the very 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.720
 expensive paper which began 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.100
 manufacturing 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 it remains only to finally make sure 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.330
 As an artificial leather roll in 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.330
 roll and and pack
