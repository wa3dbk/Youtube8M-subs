ordinance or 20 ordnance corps member

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.830 
ordinance or 20 ordnance corps member
now<00:03:20.189> it<00:03:21.189> is<00:03:21.340> quite<00:03:21.549> costly<00:03:21.760> especially<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.419> 24

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
now it is quite costly especially in 24

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.740 
now it is quite costly especially in 24
but<00:03:23.189> he's<00:03:24.189> worth<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.669> you<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:25.060> each<00:03:25.450> piece

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
but he's worth that you you each piece

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.420 
but he's worth that you you each piece
of<00:03:25.900> Ward<00:03:26.049> repairs<00:03:26.349> go<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:26.769> one<00:03:26.859> percent<00:03:27.189> so<00:03:27.370> if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
of Ward repairs go for one percent so if

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.039 
of Ward repairs go for one percent so if
you've<00:03:27.609> got<00:03:27.639> it's<00:03:28.389> about<00:03:28.450> five<00:03:28.840> people

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
you've got it's about five people

you've got it's about five people
repairing<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.799> can<00:03:29.919> get<00:03:30.069> like<00:03:30.189> five

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
repairing it you can get like five

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.759 
repairing it you can get like five
percent<00:03:30.760> open<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.060> second<00:03:31.419> on<00:03:31.599> that<00:03:31.629> door<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.000 
they're attacking you know that'd be
stupid<00:03:45.849> so<00:03:46.260> they're<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.349> key<00:03:47.680> defense

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
stupid so they're the key defense

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.259 
stupid so they're the key defense
changes<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:49.530> yeah<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.560> like<00:03:50.859> him<00:03:50.889> a<00:03:51.280> lot<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
changes one of the two things maybe they

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.619 
changes one of the two things maybe they
could<00:03:54.340> tweak<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:55.000> bit<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.359> think<00:03:55.540> they<00:03:55.599> have

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
could tweak a bit and I think they have

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.360 
could tweak a bit and I think they have
tweet<00:03:56.019> they've<00:03:56.199> released<00:03:56.349> hotfix<00:03:56.949> for<00:03:57.190> some

even<00:04:02.889> think<00:04:03.159> nothing<00:04:03.489> should<00:04:03.699> add<00:04:03.819> is<00:04:03.940> a

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
even think nothing should add is a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.520 
even think nothing should add is a
renowned<00:04:04.299> tick<00:04:04.599> for<00:04:04.780> defending<00:04:05.169> to<00:04:05.229> keep<00:04:05.409> as

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
renowned tick for defending to keep as

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.559 
renowned tick for defending to keep as
well<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.739> think<00:04:05.919> just<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.220> small<00:04:06.519> like<00:04:06.729> 1.2<00:04:07.299> k

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
well I think just a small like 1.2 k

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.000 
well I think just a small like 1.2 k
renowned<00:04:07.900> take<00:04:08.109> lightly<00:04:08.319> added<00:04:08.620> last<00:04:08.799> time

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
renowned take lightly added last time

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.379 
renowned take lightly added last time
and<00:04:09.510> pre<00:04:10.510> 1.4<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:12.849> know<00:04:12.970> that'd<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.180> nice<00:04:13.329> but

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
and pre 1.4 you know that'd be nice but

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.939 
and pre 1.4 you know that'd be nice but
yeah<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.229> it's<00:04:14.379> good<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.590> see<00:04:14.709> that<00:04:14.739> they're

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
yeah so it's good to see that they're

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.550 
yeah so it's good to see that they're
doing<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.750> then<00:04:16.750> finally<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.289> two<00:04:17.440> of

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
again I wasn't really it's not worth

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.680

I<00:04:40.420> quality<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.930> point<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.670> and<00:04:42.670> they're

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
I quality the point in that and they're

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.540 
I quality the point in that and they're
sending<00:04:42.970> from<00:04:43.180> looting<00:04:43.450> elements<00:04:43.810> as<00:04:43.900> well<00:04:43.930> so

scenarios<00:05:03.730> now<00:05:05.100> so<00:05:06.100> they've<00:05:06.310> been<00:05:06.340> shaking<00:05:06.760> up

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
scenarios now so they've been shaking up

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.190 
scenarios now so they've been shaking up
again<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.090> actually<00:05:07.300> quite<00:05:07.660> like<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:08.050> layout

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200

at<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.530> moment<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.580> good<00:05:09.760> one<00:05:10.270> thing<00:05:10.450> that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
at the moment it's good one thing that

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.880 
at the moment it's good one thing that
has<00:05:10.660> annoyed<00:05:10.960> me<00:05:10.960> since<00:05:11.440> they<00:05:11.620> released

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
has annoyed me since they released

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.130 
has annoyed me since they released
college<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.340> corruption<00:05:12.820> they<00:05:13.360> sort<00:05:13.780> of<00:05:13.930> like

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
college of corruption they sort of like

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.780 
college of corruption they sort of like
they<00:05:14.500> released<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:14.920> in<00:05:14.980> one<00:05:15.130> shape<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:15.700> that

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
scenarios probably my least favorite

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.050 
scenarios probably my least favorite
scenarios<00:05:28.750> actually<00:05:29.110> but<00:05:29.850> still<00:05:30.850> it<00:05:30.940> was

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
scenarios actually but still it was

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.460 
scenarios actually but still it was
something<00:05:31.360> new<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.690> then<00:05:31.900> not<00:05:32.080> even<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.410> in

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
something new and then not even that in

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.320 
something new and then not even that in
his<00:05:32.560> plane<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:32.920> most<00:05:33.160> of<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.310> time<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:33.970> don't

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
his plane it most of the time so I don't

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.870 
his plane it most of the time so I don't
need<00:05:34.480> to<00:05:34.540> bring<00:05:34.720> that<00:05:34.870> back<00:05:35.580> especially<00:05:36.580> in

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
need to bring that back especially in

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.430 
need to bring that back especially in
the<00:05:36.970> lower<00:05:37.120> tiers<00:05:37.420> because<00:05:37.780> low<00:05:37.990> it<00:05:38.140> is<00:05:38.260> you

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
the lower tiers because low it is you

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.380 
the lower tiers because low it is you
really<00:05:38.920> didn't<00:05:39.460> really<00:05:39.820> get<00:05:39.910> chance<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.240> play
