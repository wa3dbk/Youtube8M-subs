Fountain of Youth the water there is

and has the same natural antioxidant so

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
and has the same natural antioxidant so
the<00:00:41.610> problem<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.329> our<00:00:42.390> water<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> treated

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the problem is when our water is treated

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.529 
the problem is when our water is treated
municipal<00:00:43.739> de<00:00:44.129> stored<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.610> tanks<00:00:44.850> filtered

contaminated with chemicals like

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
contaminated with chemicals like
fluoride<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.270> ultimately<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.170> water<00:00:49.379> has

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
fluoride and ultimately the water has

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.350 
fluoride and ultimately the water has
changed<00:00:50.100> from<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.399> nature<00:00:50.760> intended<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.300> to

changed from what nature intended it to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.270 
changed from what nature intended it to
be<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.550> water<00:00:54.390> ionizer<00:00:55.079> simply<00:00:55.890> returns

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
be so a water ionizer simply returns

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.410 
be so a water ionizer simply returns
water<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.000> its<00:00:57.180> natural<00:00:57.510> most<00:00:58.170> helpful<00:00:58.590> state
