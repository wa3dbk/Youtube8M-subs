 the uncovered it identified 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.230
 and that will come looking for it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 my grandfather had a lot of cold blood but 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.060
 it was also very drive for a sea of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.060
 contradictions 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.260
 they called him and it was called the report 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.530
 produced and the king of gianfranco 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.879
 the building that dominates everything is that is the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.879
 train station 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.960
 people trying to move from one side to the 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.320
 other 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.350
 since he was there, he did not like the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 border in one night they passed amounts 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.250
 huge Jews who came with one 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.780
 put and running then we had 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.900
 to go out by this border bridge 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.990
 I took people with children in their arms 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.820
 they saw a German patrol aires 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.820
 then they delivered the French 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.710
 There are those who read him to be registered he chose 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.120
 bio could 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.120
 heavenly arrival 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.280
 with those seven rambling no longer equates 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.280
 in spain the intermediate zone 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.460
 I do not know but if I'm scared I'll 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.460
 drink 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.579
 I had to go with a stick in the city 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.069
 the tunnel so as not to trip over your 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.330
 ladies went out every day to give a 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.290
 walk after eating and that's what 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.290
 cheated the Germans 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.500
 he had returned to cause neglected but 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.500
 to Algeria and if they do not crack 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.510
 two 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.099
 but my sentences told us not to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.099
 interested Canfranc losing money 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.200
 an accident probably triggered 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.510
 it breaks the service part and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.510
 the railroad is finally closed 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.020
 in the wars and we organized the had 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.420
 fixed that there were frankly heroes 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.860
 heroes who gave their lives but so 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.080
 generously 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.820
 with whom you judge me go the letter 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.820
