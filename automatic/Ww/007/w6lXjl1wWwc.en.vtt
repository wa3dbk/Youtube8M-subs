00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.860 

all<00:01:41.440> right<00:01:41.650> we're<00:01:42.100> almost<00:01:42.220> done<00:01:42.610> we're<00:01:43.540> just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
all right we're almost done we're just

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.190 
all right we're almost done we're just
getting<00:01:44.230> them<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.770> very<00:01:45.040> stiff<00:01:45.370> key<00:01:46.200> which

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
getting them to a very stiff key which

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:59.730 
getting them to a very stiff key which
will<00:01:47.380> cost<00:01:47.620> in<00:01:47.830> just<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.430> second

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.010 

now<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.800> test<00:02:01.130> for<00:02:01.370> doneness<00:02:01.550> or<00:02:02.480> how<00:02:02.690> stiff

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
now to test for doneness or how stiff

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.500 
now to test for doneness or how stiff
the<00:02:03.170> peaks<00:02:03.380> are<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.130> should<00:02:04.340> be<00:02:04.370> able<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.760> lift

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
the peaks are you should be able to lift

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.910 
the peaks are you should be able to lift
the<00:02:06.100> egg<00:02:07.100> whites<00:02:07.370> out<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.790> get<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> stiff<00:02:08.540> peak

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
the egg whites out and get a stiff peak

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.500 
the egg whites out and get a stiff peak
obviously<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.040> can<00:02:10.190> see<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.759> my<00:02:10.970> Peaks<00:02:11.330> are

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
obviously you can see that my Peaks are

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.360 
obviously you can see that my Peaks are
not<00:02:11.720> very<00:02:12.050> stiff<00:02:12.320> at<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> moment<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.980> probably

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
not very stiff at the moment I probably

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:36.989 
not very stiff at the moment I probably
have<00:02:13.490> another<00:02:13.700> 30<00:02:14.030> seconds<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.630> go

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:36.999 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.440 

try<00:02:37.999> the<00:02:38.060> test<00:02:38.359> again<00:02:38.719> and<00:02:39.999> you<00:02:40.999> can<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.209> our

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
try the test again and you can see our

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.479 
try the test again and you can see our
Pete's<00:02:41.689> are<00:02:41.840> pretty<00:02:42.049> stuff<00:02:42.349> they're<00:02:43.189> holding

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
Pete's are pretty stuff they're holding

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.940 
Pete's are pretty stuff they're holding
their<00:02:43.639> shape<00:02:43.849> all<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:45.349> now<00:02:45.499> we<00:02:45.560> can<00:02:45.769> put

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
their shape all right so now we can put

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.129 
their shape all right so now we can put
this<00:02:46.099> aside<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> time<00:02:49.430> beam<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.329> we<00:02:50.989> can

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
this aside for the time beam and we can

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.949 
this aside for the time beam and we can
finish<00:02:51.379> off<00:02:51.680> mixing<00:02:52.189> in<00:02:52.340> our<00:02:52.609> cream<00:02:53.510> cheese<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
finish off mixing in our cream cheese to

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:06.099 
finish off mixing in our cream cheese to
our<00:02:54.079> eggs<00:03:02.049> I've<00:03:03.049> preheated<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.739> oven<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:05.109> 300

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
our eggs I've preheated the oven to 300

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:30.640 
our eggs I've preheated the oven to 300
degrees<00:03:28.269> all<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.510> I've<00:03:29.689> just<00:03:30.079> finished<00:03:30.260> up

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
degrees all right I've just finished up

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.959 
degrees all right I've just finished up
mixing<00:03:31.040> up<00:03:31.189> the<00:03:31.340> cream<00:03:31.579> cheese<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.239> egg

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:33.969 
mixing up the cream cheese and the egg

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.050 
mixing up the cream cheese and the egg
scrape<00:03:34.969> it<00:03:35.120> down<00:03:35.150> from<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.719> sides<00:03:35.959> all<00:03:36.829> right

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
scrape it down from the sides all right

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.629 
scrape it down from the sides all right
so<00:03:38.060> now<00:03:38.209> we<00:03:38.269> want<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.689> fold<00:03:38.989> in<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:40.069> egg<00:03:40.280> whites

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
so now we want to fold in the egg whites

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.729 
so now we want to fold in the egg whites
into<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.530> cream<00:03:42.530> cheese<00:03:42.560> egg<00:03:43.400> yolk<00:03:43.819> mixture

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
into the cream cheese egg yolk mixture

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.159 
into the cream cheese egg yolk mixture
trying<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.859> be<00:03:45.949> careful<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.489> we<00:03:46.639> don't

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
trying to be careful that we don't

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.589 
trying to be careful that we don't
excessively<00:03:48.169> break<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:49.370> air<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.449> we

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
excessively break up the air that we

00:03:50.599 --> 00:04:03.890 
excessively break up the air that we
just<00:03:50.840> beat<00:03:51.049> into<00:03:51.470> these<00:03:51.650> yolks

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.380 

this<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.079> what's<00:04:05.620> going<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.129> give<00:04:06.340> our<00:04:09.390> buns

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
this is what's going to give our buns

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.729 
this is what's going to give our buns
their<00:04:11.019> whiteness<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.709> fluffiness<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:16.739> replace

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
their whiteness and fluffiness I replace

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.379 
their whiteness and fluffiness I replace
meant<00:04:18.009> for<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.370> yeast<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:18.789> you'd<00:04:19.000> find<00:04:19.239> in

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
meant for the yeast that you'd find in

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:27.050 
meant for the yeast that you'd find in
most<00:04:19.600> recipes<00:04:20.579> all<00:04:21.579> right<00:04:21.699> so<00:04:22.060> I'll<00:04:22.240> put<00:04:22.600> all

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:39.360 

right<00:04:28.060> almost<00:04:28.360> done

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.340
