00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 This bacterial plaque called saburra 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.080
 lingual is the biggest bad habit villain 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.189
 so it is very important if this board 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 she has to be present 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 there are techniques and products 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.719
 Specific to this removal 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.670
 where is this board so let saburra 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.890
 get our word of mouth or I'll go 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.560
 stand up a little here then we 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.230
 will have in this text later a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.050
 white yellow card to give right is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.539
 called lingual tongue there is a website 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.579
 called lingual tongue sore that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.200
 the person will be able to find many 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.690
 information that is the largest 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.030
 villain of a main garden 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 malate that exists then lingual flush 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 This board has to be 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.770
 There are techniques and products 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.660
 The 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.309
 natural body generating what is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.890
 each one do its cleaning 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 this is a great taste question is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.390
 like when it is we call 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 when the individual is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.170
 within a normal condition he does not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 answered bucal is within his weight 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.430
 has adequate signage it does not 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 a large amount should be formed 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.659
 a normal amount must be formed that the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.950
 people call it physiological and should not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.040
 cause bad breath 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.840
 it becomes pathological or passes 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.119
 cause trouble when it forms 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.939
 an amount where it already begins to generate 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.610
 odor formation and why this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.820
 for several reasons mainly due to the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 dryness in which the mucosa of the lips 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.700
 and cheeks that would be here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 cheeks right 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 these little things when we take 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 alcoholic beverage when the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.040
 with alcohol when the person has the habit 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.229
 to change the cheek lip when you have 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.420
 low saliva production when using 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.729
 orthodontic appliance 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 mouthpiece or snore all that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.079
 It makes the mouth dry out causes 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.750
 microscopically these little beauties are 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.939
 decame is deposited in the language and then I 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.969
 I wonder would I be lying if I 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.700
 that this thesis that has been 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.939
 raw meat 11 is not raw meat and which is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.090
 the smell of decomposition of raw meat 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.799
 horrible 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 From there we already know where the main 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.770
 cause of bad breath the desquamation of these 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.390
 Give me these innocent little feet. 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.860
 microscopic but that when falling 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.480
 the tongue breaks down into the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.120
 bacteria causing the side 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.150
 bacteria proteolytic cells food 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.340
 decomposing and in this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.040
 process the release of pain as it does 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.160
 cleaning then we have three options o 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.530
 it is better to clean the tongue brush 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.030
 of the tongue scraping tooth or the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 tongue cleaners that have certain of a 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.220
 side and scraper of the other 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.780
 we have a research we did 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.880
 was published in the Rio Grande do Sul 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.950
 I can give you a website where you are 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.890
 this research who has interest 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 the site fresh breath dot com bar 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.620
 researches 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.390
 comparing cleaning with brush to 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.209
 cleaning with the scraper and with this 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.850
 technique you use with the bristle wiper 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.130
 notes on one side scraping the other 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.970
 associated with a spray for cleaning the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.340
 language 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.830
 this technique making an explanation 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.080
 very easy for a layman to understand 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.959
 when cast the tongue like brush I 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.140
 I'm using a broom, I'm going to release it. 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.820
 the center that the bottom center 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.579
 when I use the scraper I'm using 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.299
 and in this other technique I'm 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.430
 using the broom squeegee and also a 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.489
 detergent then it is obvious that this 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 technique here in the research she won 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.880
 triggered and more efficient in 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.400
 terms of removal of the lingual 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.780
 this technique was developed by me 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.370
 I presented at the World Congress in 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.900
 germany in 2009 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.940
 and these products were developed in the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.940
 in college and chemistry of unicamp
