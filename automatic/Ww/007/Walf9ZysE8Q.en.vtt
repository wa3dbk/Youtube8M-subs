00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
we'll probably have to play that in a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.089 
we'll probably have to play that in a
different<00:00:28.019> time<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.769> don't<00:00:28.980> even

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
different time because I don't even

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.550 
different time because I don't even
think<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> version<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.210> berserk<00:00:30.630> for

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
think there was a version of berserk for

but let's check it out it's games
awesome<00:01:19.369> I<00:01:22.670> think<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.759> started<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.210> Burke

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
awesome I think it started with Burke

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
awesome I think it started with Burke
whenever<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> robots<00:01:27.840> came<00:01:31.250> they<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.400> say

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
whenever the robots came they would say

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
whenever the robots came they would say
stop<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> humanoid<00:01:34.200> stop<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> intruder<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
stop the humanoid stop the intruder and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.880 
stop the humanoid stop the intruder and
it<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.200> whenever<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.409> would<00:01:37.619> walk<00:01:37.860> into

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it was like whenever you would walk into

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.690 
it was like whenever you would walk into
an<00:01:38.310> arcade<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:40.680> knew<00:01:40.829> they<00:01:41.009> had<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.460> game

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
an arcade you knew they had this game

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
an arcade you knew they had this game
because<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.720> loud<00:01:43.320> it'll<00:01:44.310> be

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
because this was so loud it'll be

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.250 
because this was so loud it'll be
the<00:01:44.579> first<00:01:44.820> thing<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.299> hear<00:01:45.689> when<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> walk

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.740

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
but you just keep going through these

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:08.810 
but you just keep going through these
levels<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.869> for<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> 80s<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.490> was<00:02:08.700> an

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
levels but for the 80s this this was an

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:24.650
