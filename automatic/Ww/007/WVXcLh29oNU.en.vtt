00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
a pig launcher light launcher the I

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.470 
a pig launcher light launcher the I
can't<00:02:34.099> really<00:02:34.130> call<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.519> digital<00:02:34.819> launcher<00:02:35.420> in

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
can't really call it digital launcher in

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:53.620 
can't really call it digital launcher in
this<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.780> has<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.959> motor<00:02:51.970> at<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.150> point<00:02:53.360> I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
this it has a motor at one point I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.479 
this it has a motor at one point I
actually<00:02:53.750> made<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> real<00:02:54.560> digital<00:02:54.860> launcher

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
actually made a real digital launcher

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.729 
actually made a real digital launcher
but<00:02:55.640> like<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.060> motor<00:02:56.330> inside<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.650> you

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
but like a motor inside of it so you

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.809 
but like a motor inside of it so you
can't<00:02:57.950> really<00:02:58.040> call<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.400> disc<00:02:58.610> launcher

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
can't really call it a disc launcher

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.300 
can't really call it a disc launcher
unless<00:02:59.330> it's<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.630> real<00:02:59.810> digital<00:03:00.230> won't<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.130> and

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
unless it's a real digital won't you and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.580 
unless it's a real digital won't you and
mine<00:03:02.090> was<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.299> real<00:03:02.510> digital<00:03:02.690> launcher<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.440> mean

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
mine was a real digital launcher I mean

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.370 
mine was a real digital launcher I mean
I<00:03:03.620> had<00:03:04.040> actually<00:03:04.250> put<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> motor<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
I had actually put a motor on to the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.780 
I had actually put a motor on to the
ripcord<00:03:06.680> launcher<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.630> was<00:03:08.900> really

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
ripcord launcher and it was really

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.390 
ripcord launcher and it was really
strong<00:03:11.530> unfortunately<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.560> took<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:13.130> apart

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
strong unfortunately I took it apart

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.849 
strong unfortunately I took it apart
because<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.239> wasn't<00:03:14.480> very<00:03:14.930> into<00:03:15.680> later

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
because I wasn't very into later

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.780 
because I wasn't very into later
beyblades<00:03:16.310> at<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.579> point<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:18.320> now<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.130> can't

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
beyblades at that point and now I can't
