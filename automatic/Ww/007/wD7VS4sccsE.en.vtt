see because you know the games based
there<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.450> they<00:02:56.510> thought<00:02:56.690> their<00:02:56.990> protective

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
there and they thought their protective

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.000 
there and they thought their protective
measures<00:02:58.040> can<00:02:58.220> stop<00:02:59.440> they<00:03:00.440> obviously<00:03:00.560> didn't

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
measures can stop they obviously didn't

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.470 
measures can stop they obviously didn't
take<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.250> consideration<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.880> ice<00:03:02.150> cream<00:03:02.360> if

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
take in consideration the ice cream if

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.170 
take in consideration the ice cream if
somehow<00:03:02.840> makes<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.440> float<00:03:03.790> not<00:03:04.790> float<00:03:05.000> up
