and that's it now there you could reach
a<00:01:18.570> point<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.740> structure<00:01:20.250> won't<00:01:20.520> go<00:01:20.729> out

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
a point where the structure won't go out

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.410 
a point where the structure won't go out
anymore

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
anymore

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.630 
anymore
like<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.950> won't<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.610> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like this one won't go out it's just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
like this one won't go out it's just
that's<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.270> must<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> limit<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> size

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that's there must be a limit to the size

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
that's there must be a limit to the size
that<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.770> build<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.270> easy

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that you can build it that's how easy

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.630 
that you can build it that's how easy
that<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:28.020> using<00:01:28.650> those<00:01:28.799> floor<00:01:29.070> panels<00:01:29.490> again

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.720 
quartering off areas with doors like
this<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.660> place<00:03:48.959> starts<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.500> flood<00:03:49.830> it

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
this if your place starts to flood it

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.320 
this if your place starts to flood it
will<00:03:51.030> spread<00:03:51.510> slower<00:03:52.020> into<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> other<00:03:52.830> areas

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
will spread slower into the other areas

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.320 
will spread slower into the other areas
okay<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.950> how<00:03:56.190> simple<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:56.940> to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
okay so that is how simple it is to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.449 
okay so that is how simple it is to
build<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.190> game<00:03:59.489> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.970> want<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
build in this game if you want it to you

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.370 
build in this game if you want it to you
actually<00:04:02.820> could<00:04:02.940> build<00:04:03.209> another<00:04:03.480> floor<00:04:03.750> up

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
actually could build another floor up

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.520 
actually could build another floor up
and<00:04:05.100> let's<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.239> where<00:04:06.420> that's<00:04:06.600> at<00:04:06.900> right<00:04:07.500> here
