natural<00:00:04.600> law<00:00:04.720> theory<00:00:04.990> Aquinas<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:07.540> depends

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
natural law theory Aquinas this depends

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.650 
natural law theory Aquinas this depends
on<00:00:08.320> a<00:00:08.380> definition<00:00:08.590> of<00:00:08.980> good<00:00:09.070> itself<00:00:09.490> and<00:00:09.760> good

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
on a definition of good itself and good

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.110 
on a definition of good itself and good
for<00:00:10.929> Aquinas<00:00:11.260> is<00:00:11.560> that<00:00:11.950> which<00:00:12.220> will<00:00:12.400> fills<00:00:12.760> his

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
for Aquinas is that which will fills his

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.480 
for Aquinas is that which will fills his
purpose<00:00:13.660> he<00:00:14.140> takes<00:00:14.350> his<00:00:14.500> idea<00:00:14.800> from<00:00:14.920> Aristotle

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
purpose he takes his idea from Aristotle

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.810 
purpose he takes his idea from Aristotle
for<00:00:16.090> many<00:00:16.269> years<00:00:16.510> before<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.400> something<00:00:18.730> is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
for many years before and something is

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.579 
for many years before and something is
given<00:00:19.150> for<00:00:19.269> this<00:00:19.359> purpose<00:00:19.720> so<00:00:19.960> knife<00:00:20.230> is<00:00:20.409> good

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
given for this purpose so knife is good

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.439 
given for this purpose so knife is good
if<00:00:20.679> it<00:00:20.800> cuts<00:00:21.039> a<00:00:21.339> computer<00:00:21.759> is<00:00:21.849> good<00:00:22.060> if<00:00:22.179> you<00:00:22.300> can

can watch videos and you can go against

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.870 
can watch videos and you can go against
that<00:00:25.599> that<00:00:26.470> as<00:00:26.589> well<00:00:26.710> make<00:00:26.859> something<00:00:27.189> good<00:00:27.369> so

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
that that as well make something good so

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.669 
that that as well make something good so
to<00:00:27.939> be<00:00:28.119> good<00:00:28.359> as<00:00:28.539> human<00:00:29.019> beings<00:00:29.050> we<00:00:29.409> need<00:00:29.589> to

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
to be good as human beings we need to

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.400 
to be good as human beings we need to
know<00:00:29.859> what<00:00:30.039> our<00:00:30.159> purpose<00:00:30.369> is<00:00:30.759> and<00:00:31.410> Aquinas

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
know what our purpose is and Aquinas

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.990 
know what our purpose is and Aquinas
says<00:00:32.680> we<00:00:32.860> know<00:00:32.980> what<00:00:33.160> our<00:00:33.190> purpose<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.700> because

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
says we know what our purpose is because

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.599 
says we know what our purpose is because
we<00:00:34.120> have<00:00:34.149> god-given<00:00:35.110> reason<00:00:35.710> as<00:00:35.800> a<00:00:35.829> universal

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
we have god-given reason as a universal

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.049 
we have god-given reason as a universal
absolute<00:00:37.210> system<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.690> ethics<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.730> use<00:00:39.940> our

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
absolute system of ethics if we use our

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.389 
absolute system of ethics if we use our
reason<00:00:40.420> which<00:00:40.989> God<00:00:41.170> has<00:00:41.289> given<00:00:41.440> us<00:00:41.649> he<00:00:41.800> says<00:00:42.010> to

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
reason which God has given us he says to

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.160 
reason which God has given us he says to
disparage<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.090> dictated<00:00:43.600> reason<00:00:43.989> is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
disparage the dictated reason is

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.959 
disparage the dictated reason is
equivalent<00:00:44.649> to<00:00:44.679> condemning<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.519> command<00:00:45.879> of

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
equivalent to condemning the command of

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.200 
equivalent to condemning the command of
God<00:00:46.210> in<00:00:46.359> other<00:00:46.510> words<00:00:46.719> God<00:00:47.170> has<00:00:47.320> given<00:00:47.559> us<00:00:47.800> our

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
God in other words God has given us our

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.849 
God in other words God has given us our
reason<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.449> that<00:00:49.510> we<00:00:49.660> will<00:00:49.750> work<00:00:49.989> our<00:00:50.230> purpose

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
reason so that we will work our purpose

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.020 
reason so that we will work our purpose
and<00:00:50.980> if<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.190> know<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:51.429> our<00:00:51.519> purpose<00:00:51.670> is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
and if you know what our purpose is

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.939 
and if you know what our purpose is
we'll<00:00:52.570> be<00:00:52.690> able<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.929> fulfill<00:00:53.320> our<00:00:53.410> purpose<00:00:53.589> and

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
we'll be able to fulfill our purpose and

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.259 
we'll be able to fulfill our purpose and
therefore<00:00:54.429> will<00:00:54.699> be<00:00:55.059> good<00:00:55.390> as<00:00:55.929> humans<00:00:56.440> ethical

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
therefore will be good as humans ethical

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.810 
therefore will be good as humans ethical
so<00:00:58.269> if<00:00:59.140> we<00:00:59.230> use<00:00:59.469> our<00:00:59.620> reason<00:01:00.010> correctly<00:01:00.460> y

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
so if we use our reason correctly y

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.479 
so if we use our reason correctly y
equals<00:01:01.179> the<00:01:01.269> right<00:01:01.780> use<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.050> reason<00:01:02.489> we'll

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
equals the right use of reason we'll

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.580 
equals the right use of reason we'll
come<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.269> realize<00:01:04.659> that<00:01:04.989> we<00:01:05.080> have<00:01:05.230> five

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
come to realize that we have five

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.640 
come to realize that we have five
primary<00:01:06.430> purposes<00:01:07.150> in<00:01:07.390> life<00:01:07.450> five<00:01:08.200> primary

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
we use our reason correctly will come to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.050 
we use our reason correctly will come to
those<00:01:20.200> conclusions<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.700> not<00:01:21.820> enough

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
those conclusions it's not enough

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.350 
those conclusions it's not enough

showing just to know our pose we need to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.180 
showing just to know our pose we need to
know<00:01:25.480> how<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.660> fulfill<00:01:25.930> our<00:01:26.200> focus<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.650> so
