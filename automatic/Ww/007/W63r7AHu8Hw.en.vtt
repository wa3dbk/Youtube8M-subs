00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.740
 I bring a little andy boxing in this 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.840
 box comes some pieces to assemble a 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.780
 very tiny puzzle is made with 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.429
 3d printers and it's very special comes out 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.260
 quite expensive because they are good people 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.390
 three of them you know and you have to buy 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.910
 dye to put it black stickers 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.970
 screws but hey I wanted to try it and 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.130
 nothing has come this package listen 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.990
 all the pieces must be inside and 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.699
 well I'm not going to tell you what puzzles 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.410
 I will teach some pieces and in the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.120
 comments you have to guess what 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.950
 puzzle is why why am I going to make a 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 video where I'm riding by 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.930
 stickers and good to see who gets it right 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.030
 so first let's open this 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.700
 small package that good here should 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.559
 come dye to be able to paint then what 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 that the pieces are being so 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.120
 nothing a little unboxing of these 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.140
 also for you to see what it is to see 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.780
 it comes like that something else not here this is rip 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.989
 tide is worth dye and inside should come 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.780
 Exact dust bags you see here 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.210
 puts black and good what is done is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.280
 take the pieces of 3d material 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.409
 3d printers and good get one 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.659
 saucepan gets water boiled and it 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.310
 puts a little dye and good parts 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.260
 they stay very nice blacks worth here 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.640
 we have a black point a white vessel and 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.400
 well I like it more in black so 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 that's why I'm going to put this dye like this 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.830
 that we leave it here and good 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.380
 now the mystery is worth this box 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.140
 let's open and let's see what puzzle 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.000
 we have truth that it is going to be 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.820
 complicated that the divine is but good 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.930
 who knows that someone is already aware of it or 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.400
 He has also bought it 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.660
 yes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.660
 and one more for what 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.960
 very well 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.840
 this around here you see it was pretty good 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.080
 protected we do not have these papers and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.180
 good that we have here to see to see 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.490
 wow 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.160
 first time I play material from 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.259
 3d printers here there is nothing else what 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.990
 What makes this printers store is 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.790
 make as a box that inside are the 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.730
 pieces listen to all the pieces are 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.960
 here inside and the material is very soft and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.270
 long what number I expected it to be so 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.670
 soft so nothing we are going to open this 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.430
 box I do not know if it's easy to open 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.140
 we will use the usual cutter for 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.900
 make a small hole to see 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.390
 I do not know if scioli easily this 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.610
 and here it has opened already you see here it 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.099
 is opening on this side 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 we have opened good so the box and 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.670
 You see what's inside, there's a good 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.680
 some dust because this is what 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.810
 they do is pick up powder and with some 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.459
 machines because they are creating the pieces and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.010
 they called on the phone and I had to stop 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.870
 the good video where we were I'm going to 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 teach a little the pieces that there are 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.920
 inside this box and so you make a 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.810
 idea and you can comment on the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.890
 comments what puzzle do you think will be 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.139
 here we have the center the core vale is 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.269
 spherical and has holes where 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.400
 put the screws watching this puzzle 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.790
 I see what to do very very complicated of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.530
 ride it we leave the core here below 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.959
 let's take what appears to be a 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.780
 center is worth here we have it 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.299
 the detail is very very high you see here 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.269
 all parties and think that they do 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.239
 3d printing machines is amazing what 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.459
 we leave here next that we have more 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.269
 well these pieces are already very rare 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.030
 I have never seen them 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.459
 has this crescent shape I do not know how 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.330
 explain it you see they are very small 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.610
 pieces and the detail is 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.650
 to see if someone guesses that he can 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.500
 be with these pieces let's leave this 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.670
 here that we have more to see I think this 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.190
 is one to see to look at what this is 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.170
 I've never seen it at some point but 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.190
 well maybe one of you is 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.390
 it happens that you can see this piece the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.180
 true that the table is filling a little 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.300
 of dust because that has to be cleaned 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.220
 and well those things a corner not this 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.220
 it's a safe corner has three parts 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.410
 this is typical of a corner okay let's go 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.180
 to leave it here for example and then I've 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.450
 seen a one piece that is very very 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.780
 small to see is she I have put 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.070
 be here look how small this thing 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.330
 what is this 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.640
 comes a stop with a three for three 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.390
 so you can see the size so small that 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.640
 it has this worth looking at it has a size 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.040
 very tiny very tiny I hope not 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.140
 break these pieces worth here we have 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.460
 put six different pieces but 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.530
 I'm sure there will be more, for example 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.100
 here seen is I think it's different 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.100
 as well 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.130
 this is the same is not the same so I have 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.480
 seen another one that is a bit different this one 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.870
 not here you see is a little shorter 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.240
 and also it just different from that 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.280
 it ends in this form and it ends in 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.130
 another way so good is going to be 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.020
 complicated is going to be a mess and good 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.540
 I hope the puzzle that results from this 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.800
 be fun to solve to see what it is 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.200
 this 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.570
 jota type of piece more as you do not see here 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.780
 a little hole to see if it focuses exactly 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.550
 to put the screw and well I think that 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.889
 If I keep looking, I'll find more 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.710
 pieces yet to see here what is this 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.620
 another more different piece is different 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.920
 also beige in a very special way 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.070
 this one focuses 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.890
 there is a very good blur as 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.680
 you can see on the table I have nine pieces 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.450
 that are different and the truth is that 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.370
 I think there will be enough more here 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.530
 inside so nothing watching these pieces 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.180
 to see if someone is able to recognize 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.780
 this puzzle and comment on the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.470
 comments 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.930
 well this here ends the unboxing now 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.010
 I'm going to make a very long video since 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.530
 I take this puzzle dyed it how much I put 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.510
 the stickers and well I'll do a review like that 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.370
 that we hope this video wants a late 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.500
 little because it's going to be very long formed 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.450
 by several parts that join them and nothing 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.610
 I hope you liked this unboxing 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.410
 of this puzzle made with 3d printers 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.210
 in this special box that also 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.670
 is made with 3d printers is what 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.020
 special and nothing here we will be like 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.020
 always the ruby ​​that you
