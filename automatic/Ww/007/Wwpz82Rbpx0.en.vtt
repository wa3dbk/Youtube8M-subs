00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170

believe<00:00:44.190> they're<00:00:44.430> gonna<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:44.969> different

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
believe they're gonna do two different

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.290 
believe they're gonna do two different
releases<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.379> guess<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:48.110> around<00:00:49.340> May<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
releases I guess one around May as the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
releases I guess one around May as the
website<00:00:51.809> said<00:00:51.989> they'd<00:00:52.140> becoming<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.710> stock<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.959 
website said they'd becoming a stock in
May<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.989> one<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.170> guess<00:00:55.379> closer<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
May and one I guess closer to when the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
May and one I guess closer to when the
film<00:00:57.690> was<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> theatre<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
film was actually in the theatre so I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.509 
film was actually in the theatre so I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
believe there's only three pieces that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
believe there's only three pieces that
are<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.390> new<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> series<00:01:07.350> 1<00:01:07.590> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:54.310 
one is the travel tracker this is the
third<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:46.460> there<00:02:47.460> we<00:02:47.580> go

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.870 

this<00:02:55.320> one<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:56.370> says<00:02:57.030> Jurassic<00:02:57.870> world<00:02:58.880> grounds

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
this one it says Jurassic world grounds

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.490 
this one it says Jurassic world grounds
crew<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> guess<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.200> crew

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
crew so I guess this is a crew

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.660 
crew so I guess this is a crew

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.870 
standard piece just repainted rolls
nicely<00:03:21.000> he's<00:03:21.300> got<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.840> nice<00:03:22.050> tyre<00:03:22.880> bolt

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
nicely he's got that nice tyre bolt

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.180 
nicely he's got that nice tyre bolt
pattern<00:03:24.540> detail<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.200> they<00:03:25.320> have<00:03:25.470> added<00:03:26.040> in

for this release these have a extra tam
pose<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.610> them<00:03:29.790> especially<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> sides<00:03:31.610> now

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
pose on them especially on the sides now

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:50.000 
pose on them especially on the sides now
here<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> cliff<00:03:35.010> hanger<00:03:48.650> here<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.800> go

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
here we have the cliff hanger here we go

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.170 
here we have the cliff hanger here we go
I<00:03:51.170> guess<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.680> sort<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.760> takes<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.120> place

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
I guess this one sort of takes the place

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.470 
I guess this one sort of takes the place
of<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.690> jeep<00:03:55.680> maybe<00:03:58.790> as<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.060> see<00:04:00.180> there's<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
of a jeep maybe as you can see there's a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.350 
of a jeep maybe as you can see there's a
dinosaur<00:04:00.810> head<00:04:01.110> on<00:04:01.290> there<00:04:01.500> JW<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.240> can

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
dinosaur head on there JW and you can

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960 
dinosaur head on there JW and you can
see<00:04:03.540> there's<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> carbon<00:04:04.110> rings<00:04:04.970> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
see there's the carbon rings the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.010 
see there's the carbon rings the
molecular<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:12.390> have<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.630> caution

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
molecular and you have the caution

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.890 
molecular and you have the caution
stripe<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.530> top<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.390> guess<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:15.690> would

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
stripe on the top so I guess this would

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.830 
stripe on the top so I guess this would
be<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.109> good<00:04:16.320> little<00:04:16.590> crew<00:04:16.799> vehicle

silver and blue so that kind of brings

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.310 
silver and blue so that kind of brings
in<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.680> likelihood<00:05:46.070> of<00:05:46.840> some<00:05:47.840> more<00:05:48.050> being
