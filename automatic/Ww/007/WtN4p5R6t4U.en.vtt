on<00:00:23.199> smart<00:00:23.439> madness<00:00:23.710> comm<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.539> LED<00:00:25.869> bulbs<00:00:26.230> are

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on smart madness comm the LED bulbs are

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.439 
on smart madness comm the LED bulbs are
ripe<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:29.279> discharged<00:00:30.279> and<00:00:30.519> white<00:00:30.910> with<00:00:31.419> a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
ripe and discharged and white with a

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.760 
ripe and discharged and white with a
bluish<00:00:31.779> tint<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.470> it

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
bluish tint to it

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.070 
bluish tint to it
so<00:00:32.950> again<00:00:33.310> it'll<00:00:33.490> match<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:34.060> good<00:00:34.510> accent<00:00:34.870> piece

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
so again it'll match a good accent piece

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.080 
so again it'll match a good accent piece
for<00:00:35.470> those<00:00:36.310> with<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.760> high<00:00:37.030> intensity

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
for those with the high intensity

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.210 
for those with the high intensity
density<00:00:37.990> volts<00:00:38.290> so<00:00:39.300> here's<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.390> SMD<00:00:41.320> or<00:00:41.650> LED

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
density volts so here's a SMD or LED

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.600 
density volts so here's a SMD or LED
bulb<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.820> we<00:00:42.940> offer<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:44.590> one<00:00:44.800> has<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.130> 18

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
bulb that we offer this one has the 18

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.840 
bulb that we offer this one has the 18
SMD<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.200> a<00:00:47.230> 1<00:00:47.500> 1<00:00:47.680> 5<00:00:47.890> 7<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.430> it's<00:00:48.580> a<00:00:48.670> dual

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
SMD and it is a 1 1 5 7 so it's a dual

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.270 
SMD and it is a 1 1 5 7 so it's a dual
filament<00:00:49.330> yeah<00:00:49.450> below<00:00:49.780> low<00:00:50.650> light<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.160> a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
filament yeah below low light and a

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.460 
filament yeah below low light and a
highlight<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:52.450> is<00:00:52.630> a<00:00:52.660> factory<00:00:53.110> when<00:00:53.290> I<00:00:53.320> hear

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
highlight this is a factory when I hear

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.280 
highlight this is a factory when I hear
it's<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.680> glass<00:00:53.980> bulb<00:00:54.810> it's<00:00:55.810> got<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.140> low

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
it's a glass bulb it's got the low

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.190 
it's a glass bulb it's got the low
filament<00:00:56.830> in<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.010> highe<00:00:57.160> filament<00:00:57.700> so<00:00:58.630> right

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
filament in the highe filament so right

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.990 
filament in the highe filament so right
now<00:00:59.320> I'm<00:00:59.410> going<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.590> get<00:00:59.680> into<00:01:00.040> replacing

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
now I'm going to get into replacing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.780 
now I'm going to get into replacing
these<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.930> actually<00:01:02.500> forgot<00:01:03.370> about<00:01:03.550> these

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
these and actually forgot about these

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.660 
these and actually forgot about these
lights<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.470> SMD<00:01:06.040> parking<00:01:06.460> light

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
lights this is the SMD parking light

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.840 
lights this is the SMD parking light
which<00:01:07.510> emits<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:08.020> bright<00:01:08.410> white<00:01:08.740> light<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.820> a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
which emits a bright white light with a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.550 
which emits a bright white light with a
little<00:01:10.180> blue<00:01:10.420> tint<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:10.930> as<00:01:11.110> well<00:01:11.320> if<00:01:11.440> you

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
little blue tint to it as well if you

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.590 
little blue tint to it as well if you
look<00:01:11.680> at<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.920> headlight<00:01:12.280> there's<00:01:13.180> an<00:01:13.330> orange

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
look at the headlight there's an orange

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.290 
look at the headlight there's an orange
bulb<00:01:13.870> in<00:01:14.050> there<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.740> that's<00:01:15.640> what<00:01:15.850> that's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
bulb in there now and that's what that's

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.180 
bulb in there now and that's what that's
the<00:01:16.450> one<00:01:16.600> we're<00:01:16.750> going<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.900> replace<00:01:17.260> old<00:01:17.830> cago

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
the one we're going to replace old cago

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.700 
the one we're going to replace old cago
we're<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:19.120> install<00:01:19.510> on<00:01:19.600> this<00:01:19.720> one<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.080> then

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
we're the install on this one and then

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.800 
we're the install on this one and then
the<00:01:21.159> corner<00:01:21.490> lights<00:01:22.500> first<00:01:23.500> step<00:01:24.659> undo<00:01:25.659> the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
the corner lights first step undo the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.560 
the corner lights first step undo the
service<00:01:26.170> slap

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.760 

service<00:01:30.380> sports<00:01:30.710> hold<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.570> can

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
service sports hold it and you can

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.660 
service sports hold it and you can
basically<00:01:34.120> grab<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.300> little<00:01:35.540> tube<00:01:35.810> that

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
basically grab the little tube that

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.130 
basically grab the little tube that
holds<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:38.030> wedge<00:01:38.240> bulb<00:01:38.570> or<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.840> parking

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
holds the wedge bulb or the parking

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.840 
holds the wedge bulb or the parking
light<00:01:39.350> you're<00:01:40.190> just<00:01:40.310> going<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.520> spin<00:01:40.820> it

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
light you're just going to spin it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.170 
light you're just going to spin it
clockwise<00:01:41.360> until<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:43.340> bowl<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.670> releases

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
clockwise until the bowl of releases

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.490 
clockwise until the bowl of releases
from<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.869> tube<00:01:45.110> itself<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.990> then<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.290> have

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
from the tube itself and then you have

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.390 
from the tube itself and then you have
that<00:01:49.250> unit<00:01:49.729> outside<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.750> headlight<00:01:51.400> the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
that unit outside of the headlight the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.830 
that unit outside of the headlight the
bulb<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.759> comes<00:01:53.030> right<00:01:53.210> out<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> wedge

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
bulb just comes right out it's a wedge

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.680 
bulb just comes right out it's a wedge
bolt<00:01:55.509> putting<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.600> SMD<00:01:57.050> it's<00:01:57.530> pretty<00:01:57.770> simple

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
bolt putting the SMD it's pretty simple

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.270 
bolt putting the SMD it's pretty simple
just<00:01:59.690> put<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.050> back<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.440> actually<00:02:00.650> goes<00:02:01.040> in

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
just put it back it actually goes in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.830 
just put it back it actually goes in
either<00:02:01.520> way<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.030> want<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.300> make<00:02:02.479> sure<00:02:02.690> it

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
either way so you want to make sure it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.770 
either way so you want to make sure it
works<00:02:03.110> before<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.649> put<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:03.979> back<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.509> we'll

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
works before you put it back in so we'll

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.330 
works before you put it back in so we'll
go<00:02:05.899> ahead<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.140> test<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.530> out

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.330 

all<00:02:10.880> right<00:02:11.000> now<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.270> it's<00:02:11.390> on<00:02:11.950> what<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:12.980> do<00:02:13.099> is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
all right now that it's on what I do is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.430 
all right now that it's on what I do is
I<00:02:13.430> leave<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:13.819> because<00:02:14.110> kind<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.200> guide<00:02:15.410> you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
I leave it on because kind of guide you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.589 
I leave it on because kind of guide you
back<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:16.069> there<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.970> cheat<00:02:17.270> way<00:02:17.450> of

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
back in there this is the cheat way of

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.330 
back in there this is the cheat way of
doing<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.050> could<00:02:18.349> actually<00:02:18.560> take<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
doing it you could actually take the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.920 
doing it you could actually take the
front<00:02:19.580> end<00:02:19.730> off<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> headlights<00:02:20.780> you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
front end off to do the headlights you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.059 
front end off to do the headlights you
could<00:02:21.110> remove<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.470> headlights<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:21.980> I'll

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
could remove the headlights but I'll

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.010 
could remove the headlights but I'll
leave<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.370> because<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:23.300> guides<00:02:23.540> me<00:02:23.810> into

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
leave it on because it guides me into

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.320 
leave it on because it guides me into
the<00:02:24.140> hole<00:02:24.349> where<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> headlight<00:02:25.819> is<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.209> if

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
the hole where the headlight is so if

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.910 
the hole where the headlight is so if
you<00:02:26.450> focus<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.989> right<00:02:27.140> here<00:02:27.349> you'll<00:02:27.500> see<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
you focus in right here you'll see the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
you focus in right here you'll see the
light<00:02:28.099> from<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.459> background<00:02:29.230> kind<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.940> aids

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
light from the background kind of aids

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.449 
light from the background kind of aids
me<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.390> try<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.599> put<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.380> thing<00:02:33.620> back<00:02:33.800> in<00:02:34.069> put

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
me and try to put this thing back in put

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.089 
me and try to put this thing back in put
this<00:02:34.610> goal<00:02:35.000> back<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.739> if<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:36.920> look

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
this goal back in so if you look

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.610 
this goal back in so if you look
straight<00:02:37.400> through<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:37.819> see<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.180> light

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
straight through you can see the light

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.280 
straight through you can see the light
once<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.769> got<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.099> there<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.599> just<00:02:41.599> twist

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
once you got in there you just twist

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.850 
once you got in there you just twist
counterclockwise<00:02:43.630> locks<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:44.959> place<00:02:45.200> there

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
counterclockwise locks it in place there

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.170 
counterclockwise locks it in place there
you<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.519> then<00:02:46.640> I'll<00:02:46.760> just<00:02:46.880> turn<00:02:47.030> it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
you have it and then I'll just turn it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.690 
you have it and then I'll just turn it
off<00:02:47.239> for<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.540> next<00:02:47.690> install<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:49.280> illustrate

the<00:02:49.880> way<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> was<00:02:50.330> taking<00:02:50.959> off<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:52.310> tube

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
the way I was taking off that the tube

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.729 
the way I was taking off that the tube
that<00:02:52.760> holds<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.150> ball<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.600> got<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> headlight

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
that holds the ball I got a headlight

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.620 
that holds the ball I got a headlight
here<00:02:55.010> which<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.459> also<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.819> passenger<00:02:56.450> side

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
here which is also the passenger side

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.509 
here which is also the passenger side
slight<00:02:57.319> variation<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.310> broadest

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
slight variation this is the broadest

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.140 
slight variation this is the broadest
side<00:02:58.819> like<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.630> factory<00:03:00.140> headlight

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
side like this is the factory headlight

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.339 
side like this is the factory headlight
the<00:03:02.150> tube<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.569> was<00:03:02.690> talking<00:03:02.840> about<00:03:03.019> buy

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
the tube that I was talking about buy

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.509 
the tube that I was talking about buy
spun<00:03:03.799> clockwise<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:04.880> two<00:03:05.060> right<00:03:05.269> here

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
spun clockwise is this two right here

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.050 
spun clockwise is this two right here
right<00:03:07.519> here<00:03:08.260> it's<00:03:09.260> connected<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.790> two<00:03:10.790> wires

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
right here it's connected to two wires

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.710 
right here it's connected to two wires
coming<00:03:11.840> out<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.200> your<00:03:12.290> factory<00:03:13.220> harness<00:03:13.720> so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
coming out of your factory harness so

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.120 
coming out of your factory harness so
again<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.109> just<00:03:15.850> twist<00:03:16.850> clockwise<00:03:18.130> pull

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
again you just twist clockwise pull

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.349 
again you just twist clockwise pull
straight<00:03:19.519> out<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.430> did<00:03:22.549> was<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.880> left<00:03:23.150> it

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
straight out so what I did was I left it

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.990 
straight out so what I did was I left it
on<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:25.459> like<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:26.000> little<00:03:26.359> guide<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.840> back<00:03:27.049> in

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
on it's like a little guide it back in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.690 
on it's like a little guide it back in
and<00:03:29.140> then<00:03:30.140> counterclockwise<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:31.190> lock<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.579> in

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
and then counterclockwise to lock it in

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.490 
and then counterclockwise to lock it in
place<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.690> want<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.900> make<00:03:33.019> sure<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.290> locks

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
place you want to make sure it locks

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.250 
place you want to make sure it locks
because<00:03:33.829> if<00:03:34.100> any<00:03:34.250> there's<00:03:35.120> any<00:03:35.299> leak<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:35.989> air

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
because if any there's any leak in air

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.809 
because if any there's any leak in air
or<00:03:36.530> air<00:03:36.859> leaks<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.340> there<00:03:37.489> they'll<00:03:37.670> actually

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
or air leaks in there they'll actually

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.819 
or air leaks in there they'll actually
build<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.540> condensation<00:03:39.049> once<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.620> light

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
build of condensation once the light

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.090 
build of condensation once the light
turns<00:03:40.069> off<00:03:40.370> you'll<00:03:41.150> get<00:03:41.269> moisture<00:03:41.569> buildup

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
turns off you'll get moisture buildup

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.809 
turns off you'll get moisture buildup
inside<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.519> headlight<00:03:45.310> next<00:03:46.310> step<00:03:46.459> I'm<00:03:46.670> going

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
inside the headlight next step I'm going

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.340 
inside the headlight next step I'm going
to<00:03:46.880> replace<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.420> quarter<00:03:47.690> lights<00:03:47.900> or<00:03:48.170> the

to replace the quarter lights or the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.949 
to replace the quarter lights or the
signal<00:03:48.680> lights<00:03:48.889> again<00:03:49.400> an<00:03:50.269> interest<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.780> time

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
signal lights again an interest of time

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.050 
signal lights again an interest of time
I'm<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.709> going<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.859> not<00:03:52.700> take<00:03:52.940> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
this one you spin counterclockwise pulls

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.590 
this one you spin counterclockwise pulls
right<00:04:00.739> out

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
right out

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.650 
right out
that's<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.720> bulb<00:04:02.900> itself<00:04:03.049> do<00:04:03.829> a<00:04:03.859> filament

lower than this one and you only want to
align<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.180> actually<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.840> only<00:04:17.900> goes<00:04:18.199> in<00:04:18.380> one

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
align it actually it only goes in one

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.189 
align it actually it only goes in one
way<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:19.010> if<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.880> got<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.299> wrong<00:04:20.540> you

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
way so if if you got it and wrong you

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.980 
way so if if you got it and wrong you
have<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.520> reorient<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:23.000> make<00:04:23.150> sure<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.510> pops

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
have to reorient it to make sure it pops

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.379 
have to reorient it to make sure it pops
in<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.320> correct<00:04:24.620> way<00:04:24.789> so<00:04:25.789> now<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.030> it's<00:04:26.240> in

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
in the correct way so now that it's in

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.680 
in the correct way so now that it's in
there's<00:04:26.780> your<00:04:26.990> LED<00:04:27.380> bulb<00:04:27.620> or<00:04:29.110> 8:18<00:04:30.110> SMD

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
there's your LED bulb or 8:18 SMD

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.340 
there's your LED bulb or 8:18 SMD
splitting<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.780> back<00:04:32.960> line<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.039> up<00:04:38.110> twist<00:04:39.110> it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
splitting it back line it up twist it

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.390 
splitting it back line it up twist it
clockwise<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.020> know<00:04:42.199> that<00:04:42.229> it's<00:04:42.560> properly

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
clockwise and to know that it's properly

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.640 
clockwise and to know that it's properly
connected<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.600> know<00:04:44.750> it'll<00:04:45.110> turn<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.500> if

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
connected it you know it'll turn on if

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.250 
connected it you know it'll turn on if
not<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.250> didn't<00:04:46.460> make<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.729> contacts<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.139> I'll

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
not you didn't make the contacts so I'll

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.570 
not you didn't make the contacts so I'll
show<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:48.470> in<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.800> headlight<00:04:49.130> that's<00:04:49.340> already

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
show you in a headlight that's already

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.000 
show you in a headlight that's already
off<00:04:49.789> how<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> did<00:04:50.419> that<00:04:50.680> all<00:04:51.680> right

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
off how I did that all right

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.000 
off how I did that all right
here<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.580> again<00:04:52.850> on<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:54.350> backside<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.830> the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
here it is again on the backside of the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.520 
here it is again on the backside of the
passenger<00:04:55.550> headlight<00:04:56.530> twist

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
passenger headlight twist

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.260 
passenger headlight twist
counterclockwise<00:04:58.960> from<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.050> surface<00:05:01.270> pulls

counterclockwise from the surface pulls

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.040 
counterclockwise from the surface pulls
right<00:05:02.479> out<00:05:03.190> after<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.280> place<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.669> ball<00:05:05.050> let's

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
right out after you place the ball let's

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.909 
right out after you place the ball let's
put<00:05:06.289> it<00:05:06.410> back<00:05:06.530> in<00:05:07.270> twist<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.590> should<00:05:09.800> be

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
put it back in twist it so it should be

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.629 
put it back in twist it so it should be
flat

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.659 

the<00:05:13.419> other<00:05:13.629> side<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:14.020> flat<00:05:14.349> so<00:05:14.379> if<00:05:14.740> it's<00:05:14.889> kind

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
the other side is flat so if it's kind

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.279 
the other side is flat so if it's kind
of<00:05:15.759> flat<00:05:16.030> that<00:05:16.360> means<00:05:16.569> you<00:05:16.659> put<00:05:16.840> in<00:05:16.990> there<00:05:17.169> is<00:05:17.199> a

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
of flat that means you put in there is a

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.129 
of flat that means you put in there is a
stop<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.030> once<00:05:19.030> it<00:05:19.180> stopped<00:05:19.449> it<00:05:19.659> should<00:05:19.870> be<00:05:20.020> in

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
stop so once it stopped it should be in
