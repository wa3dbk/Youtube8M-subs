00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.590
 nerve to everything that gives by the end of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.420
 we are going to do everything for

 you who see with you today this is a 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.690
 gift from your server for all of you 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.609
 so they can see that it 's not easy 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.379
 a sport that has its details 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.120
 has its complications and also the 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.519
 risk of the physicist who is to order 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.780
 of the day but explain to me how because as 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.570
 you have to dress a rider 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.670
 forecasts look at this let's explain 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.110
 more handle that you're wearing obviously the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.530
 hat 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.140
 the cowboy is basic in this case the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.910
 helmet is optional for riders 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.760
 if you want to put it on you have the vest 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.520
 protector the vest brings this triumph 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.060
 in this that protects you the footsteps 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.080
 of the horns of the bulls in the boots 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.200
 they are basic this schools have 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.940
 to have a quarter of a game the slice 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.790
 have to have a game room not 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.990
 it has to have a sharp edge made this horns 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.300
 crooks cares a lot about the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.060
 animals then there are penalties 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.160
 if you get to injure a bull because 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.810
 bring because a little edge in your 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.960
 roll lastimes 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.670
 there are fines for the riders that what 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 they hurt the animal I bring also the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.000
 chaps that are basic this for 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.210
 dress more than anything the moment of 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.960
 civil montage these were implemented by 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.470
 by sight by nothing else for now 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.360
 Juarez then to the cowboy and with the passage of 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.070
 the years were modified and now 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.470
 the truth is that they are very useful and if a 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.410
 bull gets to step on one leg 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.910
 with the rose injury that slide the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.910
 people of the bulls slip on the 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.410
 skin and no longer fills you no longer hits you from 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.510
 filled the blow and what you bring in the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.180
 hand that is the petal obviously pus is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.250
 the most basic thing is not to generate a bull 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.200
 I pretend to him I 'm practically already 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.610
 ready to go up completely ready 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 more or less with a cap is the torito 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.430
 I'm going to ride in about 400 515 are 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.520
 400 500 so you see it will not continue to 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.530
 400 500 kilos of power that today 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.120
 I'll ride it after a while because you 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 will see of course but in the meantime 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.290
 let's know how is the placement in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.290
 bull already at the top of the reader 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.310
 this total is placed on the back of the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.820
 bull one of the important things before 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.010
 to get on the bulls is to put them 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.960
 knees on the back and you give them with 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.480
 a sobadita so that the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.310
 nerves and the bull gets used to you 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.200
 you will be up during during the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 rider not, so what we do is 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.510
 place the prêt on top of the pallets 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.520
 of the bull you put you place your hand 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.730
 obviously with the glove you put your hand 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.800
 the index finger goes on what is the cross 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.970
 of the bull is very important that you put your 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.880
 index finger 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.000
 in the dividing line low in the column 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.430
 vertebral of the bull so that it avoids 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.230
 that your hand is injured if you put a 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.180
 little more loaded for this side then 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.910
 the jalón is going to be over there not you 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.310
 It can hurt your shoulder and your arm 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.280
 you put your hand someone 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.930
 you are going to squeeze the rope is tightened 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.640
 a rule right now in dry cones and 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.680
 also to protect for protection 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.230
 of the animal the staple can not have more 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.330
 4 inches high this prevents 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.209
 you squeeze tighten more to the bull than 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.489
 of what the lathe can support and what 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.920
 what you do is put a lock on your 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.450
 hand for greater security than not 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.330
 you fall then then it's not about 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.230
 augures are 8 seconds not in 28 seconds 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.930
 regulatory 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.140
 then you turn your hand over and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.850
 secures your hand with a padlock and this 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.950
 types you're practically ready to 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.410
 to leave no longer here depends on the bull 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.690
 is well accommodated here is giving us 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.579
 obviously very good space for 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.120
 accommodate us and what you're going to do next 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.419
 is to join you are going to put your pelvis up 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.060
 from your hand so that from here to back 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.650
 is the territory of the bull is you do not want 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.080
 be here back you want to be here 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.970
 front low on the part before leaving 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.070
 obviously you tighten the schools and you 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.480
 grapples of the bull's leather 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.480
 and accompany the lathe 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.650

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.870
 querétaro aldo gonzález of doors of the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.490
 all learn the wow stones come to 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.490
 plant face to face 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.770
 Y 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.949
 i 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.539
 what it feels like to be cross-examined 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.550
 hours and the truth is that it feels very 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.349
 father is an adrenaline that runs through you 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.590
 from the tip of the big toe to the 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.940
 I really liked this experience 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.770
 feel the bull are buried and malone by 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.259
 at least half of what the 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.729
 riders are used to riding and 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.199
 I liked it very much, I think if I can be 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.940
 rider with the kids and even no 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.039
 notice that this is a principle, it is not 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.419
 easy and everyone asks us what is 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.770
 feels to be on top of a bull I think 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.780
 that you can take parachutes I have 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.090
 made to be in a car quarter mile 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.800
 be on a fast bike and nothing is 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.270
 compare this is not exciting the truth 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.220
 is that exciting is exciting is 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.720

 Paquito the whole gang rips the ranch 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.800
 spoon and we went back to the studio because 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.389

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.389
 crooked horns at night already said
