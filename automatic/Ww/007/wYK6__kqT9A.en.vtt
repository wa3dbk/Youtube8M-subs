00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.810
 Vasari Prize Friends Solntseva Lemos we 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.030
 keep flying in or denny rose after 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.380
 previous video I flew a little 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.920
 and we are already approaching this great 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.800
 ways long way to us again you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 I repeat, but I wanted to draw 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.460
 your attention on these bright ones 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.430
 stars if you see them here if 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.250
 so here on the center to fly here you see yes 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.989
 time two three 4 5 six 7 8 or 7 stars 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 they don't seem exactly so let's 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.050
 we will try to fly there 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.870
 and see how they look the most 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 the brightest stars on this can 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.969
 say in this little one in this 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.879
 small space to small 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.010
 big rather space these stars 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.899
 can also be seen on the galaxy map 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.350
 if you look like that, we of course 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.699
 we will not see them and if we postpone 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 galactic map then we can them 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.309
 easily notice here they come out as they 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.840
 stand out just me just me there 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:16.010
 and guiding your ship 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.010
 here they are such blue dark blue stars 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.079
 most likely there were already people most likely 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 sony already scanned the whole thing but 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.780
 it does not matter that we ourselves go there 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.110
 flew and with my own eyes the whole thing 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.110
 watched it just beautiful guys 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:41.090
 I hope tomorrow we will fly to this place 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.090
 and see what 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.130
 to joe and i'm treated here 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.979
 in general, the closer we are to them the closer 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.509
 they mean it but this whole thing 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.670
 synchronized from galactics card 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.880
 galactic map and of course in the very 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.880
 the game 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.220
 1300 light years and approximately the distance 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.640
 i think maybe tomorrow afternoon we 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.170
 fly owl less than a couple of hours can 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.610
 be even more often just sit 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.970
 try to fly so close 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.970
 Let's see 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.020
 now fill up high here by the way 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:42.480
 all the stars for the problems we can 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:42.480
 refuel everywhere and continued on my way 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.770
 and after all, they stand out perfectly fine 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.870
 when allocated 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:04.920
 so we need to fly through the bottom below and 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:10.350
 there we will already take higher and page 1 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.350
 aster team 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.040
 how beautiful they stand out 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.090
 then let's fill up with the next one 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.849
 the system of our gentlemen himself grimaces I such 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.489
 Vidos will of course give you it 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.129
 Stream will fly with you and 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.370
 watch you all good luck see you soon 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.370
