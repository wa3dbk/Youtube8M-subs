00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:12.330
 the Ketchians were completely munich savage 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:14.580
 do not argue honest people 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.330

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.949
 I find a little more so we have 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 not finished installing the list of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.859
 you who has expanded the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.390
 little piece of kelly 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.829
 we build this one minute 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.180
 one and a half minutes 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.180
 At that time the squares were ready 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 yes there is not much to say that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:32.020
 my child is different and my colleagues 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:41.050
 have made this fat and sure 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:44.710
 cards because of me is my wife now 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.850
 delicious but i can handle the empty cans 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.979
 guilty 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.929
 it's just a stupid thing to do 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.770
 number and donated a lot of money to her 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.770
 want to goods 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.709
 no where it belongs 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.890
 from 1 piece works again round 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.100
 two harms can begin and that is true 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:45.800
 now 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 holy shit the vital good is it 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.000
 yes it looks like these circles are in 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.590
 do not call the commercial break 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.870
 Now, too, should not be concealed 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.420
 74 dollars is meaningful 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.380
 I could not remember what was going on 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.650
 I wrote it 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:13.340
 a half - close is he lecturer one 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:14.960
 third class no second actually 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.930
 until they are strangely at my hand 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.930
 the thick arms of you to ross with the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.630

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 minus points 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.130
 I have something to press 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.740
 I did not know how many players 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.510
 on the parapet 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:16.320
 that's what the resourceful buddy says that 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.920
 the countries that is a spider is that 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:28.230
 a spider 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:31.770
 Of course this is equivalent to 1 bayern 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.040
 Now it turns out to be quite a sign 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.140
 mutated standing that was with one 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.220
 girlfriend extra as I said suggestions 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.020

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.850

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.680
