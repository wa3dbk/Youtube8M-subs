00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.069
 Y 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.509
 i 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.429
 although we're going to start with the 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.070
 ingredients are already out here and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.890
 you need 2 carrots split in 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.930
 cubes 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.880
 I will be using half of a 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.939
 finely chopped onion 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.179
 and a chicken breast split into 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.480
 cubes also to give that area to 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:35.330
 broth to the sopita are using this 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:39.240

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.190
 and salt and we will also be using 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.690
 the numbers are going to be using 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.690
 this is for me shock and such 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.400
 you can use the oil that you 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.950
 choose but I am using this 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.970
 olive oil is a spray so I'm going 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.940
 to spray a little here in my pan 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.110
 we are going to be cooking at medium heat 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.489
 when the teachers are already hot 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.489
 let's stir everything 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810
 ah 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 and we're going to introduce you with a little salt 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.610
 and a little bit of pepper more or less 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.610
 like a few teaspoons 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.820
 now we are not going to stir everything and we are going to 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.130
 leave for about 5 minutes and this step is 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.230
 only for pepper and salt 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.540
 stick to the chicken and give it the flavor 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.030
 rich 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.780
 we are going to be adding you 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.780
 of water 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.720
 and now if it's time to add the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.880
 teaspoon chicken bouillon 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.270
 we're going to let this be sewn for a few 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.310
 8 minutes and we will add the pasta 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.409
 once there is the chick this makes a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.579
 little bit cooked what we are going to do is 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.579
 add the pasta 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.440
 and I will be using half of the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.090
 pasta that are two cups and let's leave 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.760

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 ingredients for about 15 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.080
 minutes at medium heat or if you prefer 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.690
