00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 very good kids we are in the channel 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.940
 of clash of class of my business and good 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.760
 guys as you see we are in the challenge of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.620
 the week and in this case we had 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.630
 to use the same number of giants 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.120
 and of balloons 5 breaks walls the minions 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 that we want in the case of the clan one of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 the four previous troops is to say 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 giant breaks walls balloons webs pines 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.949
 use the heroes and we had them 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.160
 spells free choice and good since 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.920
 He took out each one in this case we have open 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.740
 already at 845 ming of top clan from 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.780
 here I send you a great greeting the truth 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 and many thanks for sending me your 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
 repetition and your challenge is a little faith and the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 truth of this attack because well 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.400
 You see that he can not destroy all the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.560
 defenses successfully so 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 to the minions I think he has thrown them 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.030
 a little too soon I would not have 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 expected first that I would have loaded you 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 all defenses before using the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.730
 henchmen because it is that if you have not 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 seen that only one minion remains 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.810
 mpi shoots the hero stays he without a hero 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
 and it came to them then the only thing that will do 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.100
 is going to be taking away all the dark being 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.020
 says I'm from the dark xxi I'm going to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.370
 bring all the dark being to my house 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 but good a booty of 710 or 717 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.660
 dark success is going to be in total I think that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 Well, it will not be bad and 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.479
 well, 44% at the gates of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.600
 get 50 in second place we have 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.160
 to strong frames of the mining clan 2.0 and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.660
 As you can see, well, first take out the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.550
 clan castle and here what you 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.950
 I recommend that if they are pretty troops 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.270
 high as minions level 3 or 4 what 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 I recommend you is that you have many 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.580
 henchmen because it is that to notice that a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.590
 henchman of them his kills almost a 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.729
 minion your therefore therefore what 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 Today I recommend you use 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.570
 many henchmen to be able to kill the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 castle because it is that if you are not going to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 kill all the troops you have if you do not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000
 you're going to get to kill the castle so 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.890
 what all the troops 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.420
 sack to kill the castle then by 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.550
 here under me I think his technique was 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.510
 destroy air defense the problem 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.000
 what has happened is that you have been 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.590
 clueless all the giants by the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 right since good they have burst 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.270
 the wall and how they had the compartment 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.179
 then open over there to the other 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.430
 Well, tower archers have sanz 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.709
 wasted all the giants out there 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.940
 and that has been the problem the second 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.890
 problem that this attack has had is 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.050
 that has used all the balloons to sack 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.360
 has thrown them into a common point by 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 which, well, the tower of magicians has 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.040
 used their splash damage and they 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.230
 has left almost life in red and that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
 Well, the truth is a bit bad because 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.220
 now if you look at the moment that 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 they get into the area of air defense they 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.390
 they load a balloon for every shot that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 makes good then with the fabrics and everything 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.440
 I do not even tell you but good luck 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.780
 has had been the giant out there 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.820
 dispersing the defenses a little 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.350
 Then here I saw them rite that good 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.820
 for adding a little in the percentage 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.530
 but he can not get at least the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.230
 50% good then so take it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.250
 some trophies and win the game but 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.350
 good 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.800
 the next attack yes that is one of the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.330
 that I have liked to forgive and good 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.140
 Well, the next attack, as you can see, is 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.700
 Lifting and liza high of my business 1.0 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.170
 in this case after good is already in my 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.610
 business top 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.080
 from here I had a greeting and zaha and 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.170
 thank you very much for truth 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.570
 send me this repetition as you see in 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.540
 first place uses all the big 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.510
 which is good to see if first 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.940
 to see if there was forgiveness castle is worth yes 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.920
 had clan castle and if not then 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.230
 good already pulled with giant balloons 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.330
 from behind the minions for good 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.950
 Well the balloons if they catch any bomb 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.050
 the balloons take him away and he does not 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.910
 bring the spirits 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.860
 healing spell rage spell 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.750
 in order to infuriate them a little bit 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.239
 troops and they start to burst a bit 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.920
 more that area the air defense out there 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.050
 it's doing a lot of damage but good 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.910
 between arrives at the queen arches the 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.820
 balloons and everything and finally it takes 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.989
 the boot of dark election bow of 907 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.780
 of the ix the dark that is an authentic 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.780
 outrageous get 50% grave on 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.810
 City Hall already gets almost 60 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.940
 hundred that will have it already just 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.220
 and well , it's really done 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 piece of attack and in this case you have left 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.940
 the jump spell that will use it 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.120
 with those two giants that are left by the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.709
 right and with the with the archers and the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.350
 queen archer so good for like that to see 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.060
 If I could get 100%, I think that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.250
 here he has squandered the spell a little 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.930
 of jumping would have been a better spell 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.270
 of rage for balloons a success of 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.889
 healing but hey is pretty good 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.800
 also the jump spell because 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.410
 It was also well thought because if 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.790
 you take few breaks the giants walls 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.370
 you stay in the center and you have to 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.100
 use or some spell to be able to 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.620
 break the wall but good finally 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.870
 we have a camper of meaning of top from 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.030
 here that a camper greeting was extended and 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.740
 also thanks for sending me your 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.530
 repetition down here starts at 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.590
 take it all out and if you look 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.169
 uses a pretty huge amount of 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.940
 henchmen are all together around here the 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.610
 problem is that if they bump into each other 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.830
 with some of these bombs or a mine 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.139
 the problem is that they fall 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.840
 how like bugs they fall like flies 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.910
 the henchmen and then a little bit wrong 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.710
 but good, what I recommend is 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.090
 that you use a few balloons for 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.710
 in front or some forgiveness to some 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.320
 dragon for well then good if they catch 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.699
 some of these red bombs 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.830
 they are ticklish for them but good 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.870
 for the minions you are going to notice that in 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.690
 the moment they drop out of the town hall 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.330
 around here are a few little bombs for 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.490
 which then you are going to see that there is a 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.130
 pump is charged 78 winters and that therefore 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.479
 it does a lot of damage at the end here 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.550
 you see that a bomb goes out and for me 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.290
 they all fall like flies, they are already there 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.630
 with a few and good the only thing 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.130
 have to do is add up the percentage 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.630
 troops that you have to use for the 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.880
 next I challenge you next week 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.900
 are between 15 and 20 wall breaks 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.970
 20 giants 10 or 11 Valkyrie depends 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.560
 of the wall breaks and we use in the 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.590
 clan castle the troops that 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.330
 We want worthy of the previous ones and 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.639
 spells free choice so good 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.889
 guys I hope you liked to give 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.440
 a favorite line to this video put me in 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.690
 the comments that then one that attacks 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.280
 you want us to use in the next 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.590
 repetitions about the next challenges 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.210
 see you in the next video 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.210
 and until the next goodbye
