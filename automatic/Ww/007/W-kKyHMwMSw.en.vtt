a long way from from Rome but at the

Carthage<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> huge<00:00:55.800> problem<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.160> me

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Carthage was a huge problem for me

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.890 
Carthage was a huge problem for me
because<00:00:56.339> I<00:00:56.489> had<00:00:56.610> an<00:00:56.760> empire<00:00:57.180> which<00:00:57.300> dominated

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
because I had an empire which dominated

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.530 
because I had an empire which dominated
not<00:00:58.559> only<00:00:58.890> North<00:00:59.159> Africa<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.610> also<00:00:59.820> Spain<00:01:00.239> at

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
not only North Africa but also Spain at

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.990 
not only North Africa but also Spain at
one<00:01:00.750> point<00:01:01.129> Carthaginian<00:01:02.129> Army's<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.760> very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
one point Carthaginian Army's got very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
one point Carthaginian Army's got very
close<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.570> dealing<00:01:04.020> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> damage<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.619> Rome

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
close to dealing a lot of damage to Rome

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.499 
close to dealing a lot of damage to Rome
and<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.550> thought<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.789> was<00:01:05.880> about<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
and they thought it was about time that

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.240 
and they thought it was about time that
this<00:01:06.720> should<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.170> come<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.680> end<00:01:07.830> because

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
this should all come to an end because

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.330 
this should all come to an end because
Rome<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.789> really<00:01:09.149> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> cusp<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:10.340> losing

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
Rome was really on the cusp of losing

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.450 
Rome was really on the cusp of losing
the<00:01:11.520> war

so<00:01:13.180> they<00:01:13.390> had<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.630> come<00:01:14.170> from<00:01:14.260> the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
so they had to come from the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.110 
so they had to come from the
masterstroke<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:15.400> siege<00:01:15.550> of<00:01:15.580> Carthage<00:01:15.970> been

at<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> same<00:02:25.299> time<00:02:25.570> so<00:02:26.350> what<00:02:26.980> we've<00:02:27.160> done<00:02:27.370> is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
at the same time so what we've done is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.970 
at the same time so what we've done is
created<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.959> tactical<00:02:29.530> map<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.890> been

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
created a tactical map it's been

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.840 
created a tactical map it's been
something<00:02:30.130> we've<00:02:30.250> wanted<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.610> put<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
something we've wanted to put in the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.090 
something we've wanted to put in the
game<00:02:30.970> for<00:02:31.299> quite<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> few<00:02:31.959> titles<00:02:32.140> now<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.950> it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
game for quite a few titles now but it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.190 
game for quite a few titles now but it's
never<00:02:33.280> quite<00:02:33.880> been<00:02:34.120> right<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.780> some<00:02:34.989> people

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
never quite been right so some people

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780 
never quite been right so some people
might<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.739> putting<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.250> tactical<00:02:36.670> map

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
might think that putting a tactical map

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.610 
might think that putting a tactical map
into<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.060> game<00:02:37.239> may<00:02:37.450> make<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.840> too<00:02:38.140> easy<00:02:38.170> you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
into the game may make it too easy you

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.780 
into the game may make it too easy you
can't<00:02:38.830> actually<00:02:38.950> control<00:02:39.130> units<00:02:39.549> from<00:02:39.610> that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
can't actually control units from that

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.240 
can't actually control units from that
level<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.930> very<00:02:41.200> much<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> tactical<00:02:41.799> overview

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
level it's very much a tactical overview

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.640 
level it's very much a tactical overview
it's<00:02:42.519> really<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.120> great<00:02:43.540> orientation<00:02:43.930> tool

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
it's really a a great orientation tool

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.500 
it's really a a great orientation tool
there's<00:02:45.489> something<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.060> players<00:02:46.299> have

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
there's something that the players have

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.060
