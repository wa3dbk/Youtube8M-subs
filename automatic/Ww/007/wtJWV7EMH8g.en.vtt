often find a ship itself can kind of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.270

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
some of us sometimes that's the reason

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
some of us sometimes that's the reason
why<00:00:49.079> we're<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.500> cruising<00:00:50.010> maybe<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
why we're going cruising maybe one we

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
why we're going cruising maybe one we
want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> check<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> new<00:00:51.690> ship<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:53.039> all

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
want to check out a new ship or it's all

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
want to check out a new ship or it's all
about<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.760> features<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> particular<00:00:54.780> ship

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
about the features that particular ship

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.709 
about the features that particular ship
has<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> offer<00:00:55.730> sometimes<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.539> much

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
has to offer sometimes it's not so much

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
has to offer sometimes it's not so much
about<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.170> ship<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> destination<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
about the ship as the destination so I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.930 
about the ship as the destination so I
think<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.899> depends<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.250> cruise<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> lot

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
think it depends on if you cruise a lot

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.420 
think it depends on if you cruise a lot
what<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:03.960> destination<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.159> kind<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
what your destination is just kind of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
what your destination is just kind of
your<00:01:05.549> crew<00:01:05.850> style<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> general<00:01:06.439> but<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.530> know

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
your crew style in general but I know

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
for my husband and I a lot of times it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
for my husband and I a lot of times it's

ship<00:05:23.720> for<00:05:23.990> Royal<00:05:24.170> Caribbean<00:05:24.350> as<00:05:24.800> well<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:25.280> a

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
ship for Royal Caribbean as well it's a

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.580 
ship for Royal Caribbean as well it's a
little<00:05:25.550> bit<00:05:25.640> smaller<00:05:25.970> than<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.780> freedom<00:05:27.380> class

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
little bit smaller than a freedom class

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.580 
little bit smaller than a freedom class
but<00:05:28.010> it<00:05:28.640> doesn't<00:05:29.120> feel<00:05:29.360> small<00:05:29.930> like<00:05:30.260> it<00:05:30.410> has<00:05:30.560> a

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
but it doesn't feel small like it has a

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.010 
but it doesn't feel small like it has a
lot<00:05:30.890> of<00:05:30.950> nice<00:05:31.250> things<00:05:31.480> probably<00:05:32.480> one<00:05:32.840> of<00:05:32.870> the
