alright<00:00:56.879> common<00:00:57.180> mistakes<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
alright common mistakes with the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
alright common mistakes with the
frontside<00:00:58.020> 5050<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.309> demonstrated

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
frontside 5050 as we just demonstrated

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.720 
frontside 5050 as we just demonstrated
is<00:01:00.170> allying<00:01:01.170> too<00:01:01.379> far<00:01:01.739> over<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> rail<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
is allying too far over the rail so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
is allying too far over the rail so
unlike<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.300> board<00:01:03.660> slides<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.080> really

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
unlike the board slides we really

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
unlike the board slides we really
concentrated<00:01:05.400> hauling<00:01:05.729> hi<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the 50-50 it's got to be more precise
