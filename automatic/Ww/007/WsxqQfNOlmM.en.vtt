00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.850
 after more than 32 years of dedication to 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.240
 mechanics decided to turn his life around 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.740
 I started to take it off after over 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.039
 and little by little what happened to me was 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.199
 that I took the hook so much that it ended 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:36.010
 becoming a champion of the 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.010
 bodybuilding then to overtake 262 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.120
 up to 125 degrees guarantee it has 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.120
 got all the championships 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.810
 possible among them the one from Spain the one from 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.470
 europe and also the world's I do not have 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.900
 20 years 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.900
 inside that when I go to the gym 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.240
 It helps me to start training all 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.330
 the days in the morning and in the afternoon and 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.090
 these are the results with almost 70 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.970
 years manuel still has potential for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 give and leave manuel but suffers when 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.570
 they make these poses much more than the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 people who believe also make these poses 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 tighten the athletes from the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.619
 bangs to the city of the feet 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.420
 but not all that exercise and that is 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.640
 He cares what you eat has rajatabla 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 Manuel dos breakfast prepared 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 times first thing in the morning before 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.380
 to go to the gym and then again 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 and what does Manuel eat right now? 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 will eat rice and grilled chicken 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.500
 how it takes to have a husband 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.689
 Tancacha better and sometimes for other 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.850
 times worse because people look a lot 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.939
 when we go on vacation and that's always 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.520
 today he gives me a cut he draws attention 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.829
 attention and that's how it was before we started 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.979
 lifting weights has changed a lot Mary 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.619
 Jesus did not enough has changed 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.380
 has nothing to do with looks and withdraw 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.660
 nothing manuel assures that it will continue putting 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.349
 muscles until your body and mind 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.349
 hold on
