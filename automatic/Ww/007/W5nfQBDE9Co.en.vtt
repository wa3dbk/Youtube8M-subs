00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 Hello, how are you? I am GijÃ³n and the day of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.700
 Today I bring you the jailbreaking 6.1 point 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.700
 3 I bring it this way because 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.950
 I'm not going to do it anymore because 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.680
 if I do I could already do some 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.090
 videos 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.420
 or I would like a little more work 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.320
 because the jailbreak is tt and this 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.380
 jailbreak is only available for what 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.550
 what is the ipod and the iphone in fourth 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.340
 generation the ipod in fourth generation 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.830
 and the iphone 3gs is not available for 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.760
 iphone 5 ni for ipad mini for the 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.760
 father 3 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.699
 and part 4 creates then if you do not 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.589
 they need to use do not do it because what 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.810
 what they are going to do is lose their grass that 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.790
 hunter and they 're going to have to have it teapot 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.440
 forces that I recommend that without 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.479
 you who update do not do it is not 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.259
 necessary there will not be new things 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.009
 then do not do it if for some other 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.990
 relationship 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.979
 the reason they had to restore it something 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.259
 well they did it then well that's the 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.300
 this is the option not if they have iphone 5 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.119
 or one of those that I already said more 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.530
 advanced for the moment you can not 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.450
 do what we hope is that there is still 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.640
 a way to return to the version 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.640
 previous and be able to do it in 6.1 point 2 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.890
 and if he gets to see that option, I know 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.220
 I'll let you know guide a video about this 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.369
 then these are the options 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.140
 currently what all that is 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.330
 traditional networks will not be for 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.190
 windows and for mac and it's left in the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.480
 registration so check or download 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.790
 do not install it and do 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.710
 and well I think that's all if it reaches 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.010
 need one thing remember they can 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.230
 comment on doubts or suggestions from 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.820
 jailbreak in 6.1 point 3 because I 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.470
 want to ask what can they put there 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.140
