to<00:00:31.980> shape<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.369> glove<00:00:32.640> by<00:00:33.390> putting<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> light

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to shape the glove by putting a light

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.360 
to shape the glove by putting a light
stretch<00:00:34.200> over<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> entire<00:00:34.800> surface<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
stretch over the entire surface of the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
stretch over the entire surface of the
glove<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> close<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> bag<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
glove so when I close up the bag in this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.000 
glove so when I close up the bag in this
case<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.480> want<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> cross<00:00:40.050> them<00:00:40.290> over<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
case I want to cross them over that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.560 
case I want to cross them over that
creates<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> roll<00:00:42.329> over

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
creates that little bit of a roll over

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.639 
creates that little bit of a roll over
to<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> finger<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.170> when<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to the finger so when you go to the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.869 
to the finger so when you go to the
ground<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> glove<00:00:44.309> you've<00:00:44.520> got<00:00:44.670> nice

flat surface scoop that ball off the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
flat surface scoop that ball off the
ground<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.989> piece<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.890> creates<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
ground the piece that creates the the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.459 
ground the piece that creates the the
flare<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.340> this<00:00:53.340> clip<00:00:54.260> bring<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> together

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
