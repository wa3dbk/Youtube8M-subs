 duck beans with cited villero eyelet to fresh 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.539
 let's start making a blond candy for that sugar in the pan 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.820
 and watch over everything to watch that we do not burn that I loved him so much burns 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.240
 so it burns to throw him to put another 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.350
 to cut the onion julienne with this one the caramel made adding moss to the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.850
 pan a little more come another little bit more percent that's 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.730
 well onion 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.380

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.940
 a bay leaf 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.480
 and then it came down 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.960
 well above has already been done 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.790
 would be the result of the pearl onion being made 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.740
 we go with the puff pastry that we will have them and we put the confit duck gizzards 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.950
 that yes in order before we have cut pieces in rooms and we have drawn 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.950
 over we will put the racial onion it is better that it is cold to wait for 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.830
 be cold 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.230
 and then we will close the booming 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.910
 because we are going to prepare to take it to the oven we are born some cuts for when 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.260
 let's cut it as easily as possible and before putting it in the oven 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.210
 we painted it egg 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.070
 in the oven how much we will have it then from 15 to 20 minutes in 180 degrees 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.720
 centigrade temperature 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.640
 it's already happened we have it cut through the pre-marked cuts 2 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.350
 and we just have to put on putting it pretty for example 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.960
 in three pieces tandon a little height and decorating with fresh herbs 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.659
