00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.629 
thinking a lot about Lent as a time to
make<00:00:13.259> sure<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.799> are<00:00:13.920> headed<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> right

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
make sure we are headed in the right

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.180 
make sure we are headed in the right
direction<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.330> our<00:00:15.450> lives<00:00:15.920> there's<00:00:16.920> another

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
direction in our lives there's another

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.370 
direction in our lives there's another
way<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.580> looking<00:00:17.730> at<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.150> too<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.230> was

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
way of looking at this too and I was

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.900 
way of looking at this too and I was
reminded<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> read<00:00:20.640> something

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
reminded of this when I read something

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
reminded of this when I read something
recently<00:00:21.270> by<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.869> early<00:00:22.199> church<00:00:22.470> father<00:00:22.769> named

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
recently by an early church father named

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.089 
recently by an early church father named
st.<00:00:23.699> Gregory<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> Nyssa<00:00:24.750> he<00:00:25.740> talked<00:00:25.980> about

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
st. Gregory of Nyssa he talked about

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.720 
st. Gregory of Nyssa he talked about
keeping<00:00:26.760> our<00:00:26.939> eyes<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.720> Jesus<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:29.550> that's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
keeping our eyes on Jesus I think that's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.030 
keeping our eyes on Jesus I think that's
the<00:00:29.970> same<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.390> keeping<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.019> eyes<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.380> heaven

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the same as keeping your eyes on heaven

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.850 
the same as keeping your eyes on heaven
but<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> reminder<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:33.989> our<00:00:34.410> lives

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
but this is a reminder that our lives

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.119 
but this is a reminder that our lives
are<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.640> journey<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> place<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
are not just a journey to a place but to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.780 
are not just a journey to a place but to
a<00:00:38.160> person<00:00:39.290> Jesus<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.980> course<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
a person Jesus is here of course in the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.959 
a person Jesus is here of course in the
Holy<00:00:42.149> Eucharist<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.410> he's<00:00:43.829> also<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:44.730> in

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Holy Eucharist but he's also there in

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.569 
Holy Eucharist but he's also there in
heaven<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.379> keep<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:46.770> eyes<00:00:46.800> fixed<00:00:47.460> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
heaven and if we keep our eyes fixed on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
heaven and if we keep our eyes fixed on
him<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.300> we'll<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.539> less<00:00:48.960> distracted<00:00:49.680> by

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
him and we'll be less distracted by

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950 
him and we'll be less distracted by
things<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:50.399> us<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.449> us<00:00:51.570> headed

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
things around us that can get us headed

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.220 
things around us that can get us headed
in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> wrong<00:00:52.320> direction<00:00:52.379> away<00:00:53.280> from<00:00:53.489> heaven

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
in the wrong direction away from heaven
