extremely awkward for you until things

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.270 
extremely awkward for you until things
get<00:00:37.450> rolling<00:00:37.630> because<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.950> just<00:00:39.040> how<00:00:39.190> it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
get rolling because that's just how it

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.580 
get rolling because that's just how it
is<00:00:39.340> for<00:00:39.550> me<00:00:39.670> um<00:00:40.020> gameplays<00:00:41.020> nothing<00:00:41.379> too

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
is for me um gameplays nothing too

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.580 
is for me um gameplays nothing too
special<00:00:42.219> it's<00:00:42.610> just<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:43.000> free-for-all<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:44.050> think

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
special it's just a free-for-all I think

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.890 
special it's just a free-for-all I think
the<00:00:44.680> final<00:00:44.860> score<00:00:45.070> was<00:00:45.280> 30<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:45.760> eight<00:00:46.210> yeah

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
the final score was 30 and eight yeah

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.000 
the final score was 30 and eight yeah
that's<00:00:47.110> right<00:00:47.260> um<00:00:47.580> so<00:00:48.580> don't<00:00:49.390> uh<00:00:49.750> just<00:00:50.620> if<00:00:50.829> you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
that's right um so don't uh just if you

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
been having more fun getting killfeeds

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.420 
been having more fun getting killfeeds
and<00:06:27.909> in<00:06:28.909> my<00:06:29.120> opinion<00:06:29.270> it<00:06:30.069> it's<00:06:31.069> a<00:06:31.219> lot<00:06:31.400> more
