00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
these pencils are wax-based so it should

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
these pencils are wax-based so it should
be<00:01:14.460> fairly<00:01:14.760> easy<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> color

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
be fairly easy for you to get the color

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.270

I'm<00:01:23.689> just<00:01:24.689> laying<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.079> color<00:01:25.289> down<00:01:25.560> because

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I'm just laying the color down because

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
I'm just laying the color down because
I'll<00:01:26.219> be<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.360> using<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:27.990> blending

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I'll be going in and using my blending

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.950 
I'll be going in and using my blending
stump<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> mineral<00:01:29.640> spirits<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.420> blend

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
stump and the mineral spirits to blend

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.419 
stump and the mineral spirits to blend
the<00:01:31.140> color<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.619> together<00:01:31.829> now<00:01:34.100> it's<00:01:35.100> okay<00:01:35.340> if

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
the color all together now it's okay if

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.719 
the color all together now it's okay if
you<00:01:35.549> touch<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.969> image<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:37.710> don't<00:01:38.070> try<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> get

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you touch the image I don't try to get

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.190 
you touch the image I don't try to get
too<00:01:38.789> close<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> image<00:01:39.630> at<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.899> point

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
too close to the image at this point

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.910 
too close to the image at this point
because<00:01:40.500> when<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> blend<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> stump<00:01:41.909> I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
because when I blend with the stump I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
because when I blend with the stump I
shade<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> areas<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.600> white<00:01:45.869> closer

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
shade in the areas that are white closer

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.279 
shade in the areas that are white closer
to<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.890> image<00:01:47.420> now<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> added<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> mineral

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
to the image now I added the mineral

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.080 
to the image now I added the mineral
spirits<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> stump<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.670> starting<00:01:51.060> my

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
spirits to the stump and I'm starting my

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
spirits to the stump and I'm starting my
blending<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.579> I'll<00:01:53.579> often<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
blending here and I'll often go back to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.160 
blending here and I'll often go back to
the<00:01:55.759> acrylic<00:01:56.759> block<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.390> grab<00:01:57.630> some<00:01:57.659> more

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the acrylic block and grab some more

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.949 
the acrylic block and grab some more
mineral<00:01:59.130> spirits<00:01:59.580> depending<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.270> how<00:02:00.810> much

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
mineral spirits depending on how much

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.499 
mineral spirits depending on how much
blending<00:02:01.289> I<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.310> you'll<00:02:03.240> find

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
blending I want to do and you'll find

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.020 
blending I want to do and you'll find
that<00:02:03.720> if<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.020> stump<00:02:04.289> is<00:02:04.439> dry<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.640> blending

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that if your stump is dry the blending

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.749 
that if your stump is dry the blending
doesn't<00:02:06.439> happen<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.739> easily<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
doesn't happen as easily so you want to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.350 
doesn't happen as easily so you want to
make<00:02:08.789> sure<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> moist<00:02:09.750> stump<00:02:11.209> now<00:02:12.209> i'm

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
make sure you have a moist stump now i'm

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.569
