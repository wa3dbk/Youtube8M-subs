00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
part of the rubber would go inside the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.890 
part of the rubber would go inside the
port<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:42.250> example<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.670> 30-pin<00:02:43.090> charging

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
port for example the 30-pin charging

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.140 
port for example the 30-pin charging
connector<00:02:44.380> thing<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:45.340> would<00:02:45.520> have<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> little

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
connector thing it would have a little

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.210 
connector thing it would have a little
piece<00:02:46.300> of<00:02:46.450> rubber<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:46.930> inside<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:48.130> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
piece of rubber that will inside just to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.640 
piece of rubber that will inside just to
completely<00:02:48.640> seal<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:49.330> well<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
completely seal it as well for the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.080 
completely seal it as well for the
headphone<00:02:51.069> jack<00:02:51.099> that<00:02:51.550> would<00:02:51.670> obviously<00:02:51.760> be

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
headphone jack that would obviously be

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.089 
headphone jack that would obviously be
on<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.330> top<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:53.019> would<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.560> piece

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
on the top it would have a little piece

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.710 
on the top it would have a little piece
of<00:02:54.280> rubber<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.610> will<00:02:54.790> go<00:02:54.910> inside<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
of rubber that will go inside the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.330 
of rubber that will go inside the
headphone<00:02:56.110> jack<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.349> i<00:02:56.470> was<00:02:56.590> super<00:02:56.920> annoying

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
headphone jack and i was super annoying

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.040 
headphone jack and i was super annoying
because<00:02:58.030> sometimes<00:02:58.510> they<00:02:58.569> wouldn't<00:02:58.720> go<00:02:58.930> in

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
because sometimes they wouldn't go in

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.720 
because sometimes they wouldn't go in
properly<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.830> wouldn't<00:03:00.099> shut<00:03:00.430> properly

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
properly and it wouldn't shut properly

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.050 
properly and it wouldn't shut properly
in<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:02.019> case<00:03:02.349> all<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.980> does<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.430> clicks<00:03:03.849> on

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
in this case all it does it clicks on

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.240 
in this case all it does it clicks on
these<00:03:04.209> two<00:03:04.510> corners<00:03:04.840> right<00:03:05.140> here<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:06.010> just

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
these two corners right here to just

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.509 
these two corners right here to just
seal<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.880> that's<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:08.080> same<00:03:08.920> goes<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
seal it and that's it same goes for the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
seal it and that's it same goes for the
headphone<00:03:09.850> jack<00:03:09.880> all<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.200> got<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.410> do<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
headphone jack all you got to do is

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.440 
headphone jack all you got to do is
close<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.459> seal<00:03:12.819> those<00:03:12.970> two<00:03:13.209> little

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
close it and seal those two little

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.449 
close it and seal those two little
corners<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.019> that's<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.130> don't<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.340> to

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
corners and that's it you don't have to

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.550 
corners and that's it you don't have to
deal<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:16.000> any<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.420> rubber<00:03:16.600> piece<00:03:16.930> that

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
deal with any little rubber piece that

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.890 
deal with any little rubber piece that
might<00:03:17.830> have<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.280> go<00:03:18.400> inside<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.330> port<00:03:19.599> because

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
might have to go inside the port because

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.500 
might have to go inside the port because
they<00:03:20.049> got<00:03:20.170> rid<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.670> my<00:03:22.090> opinion

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
they got rid of that and in my opinion

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.030 
they got rid of that and in my opinion
that<00:03:22.540> was<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.810> really<00:03:23.349> great<00:03:23.470> decision<00:03:23.920> on

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
that was a really great decision on

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.890 
that was a really great decision on
their<00:03:24.130> behalf<00:03:24.340> because<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:25.150> was<00:03:25.330> super

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
their behalf because that was super

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.830 
their behalf because that was super
annoying<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.860> without<00:03:27.519> further<00:03:27.790> ado<00:03:28.180> let's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
annoying so without further ado let's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.080 
annoying so without further ado let's
get<00:03:29.019> this<00:03:29.140> bad<00:03:29.349> boy<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.920> here

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.580 

so<00:03:33.630> what'd<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.810> do<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.410> phone

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
so what'd you do to get to the phone

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.270 
so what'd you do to get to the phone
inside<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.190> take<00:03:35.459> off<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:37.110> rubber<00:03:37.290> case<00:03:37.620> now

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
inside you take off the rubber case now

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.550 
inside you take off the rubber case now
it's<00:03:38.430> super<00:03:38.580> easy<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.959> rubber<00:03:40.170> part

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
it's super easy because the rubber part

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.740 
it's super easy because the rubber part
on<00:03:40.739> otterbox<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.459> case<00:03:41.700> aren't<00:03:42.180> cases<00:03:42.420> are

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
on otterbox this case aren't cases are

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.370 
on otterbox this case aren't cases are
usually<00:03:43.319> very<00:03:44.420> flexible<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.780> they<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.080> bend

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
usually very flexible and they can bend

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.949 
usually very flexible and they can bend
easily<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.980> like<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.160> TPU<00:03:47.700> case<00:03:48.150> where<00:03:48.450> it's

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
easily it's like a TPU case where it's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.170 
easily it's like a TPU case where it's
kind<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.319> it's<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.620> little<00:03:49.709> bit<00:03:49.920> more<00:03:50.040> tough<00:03:50.340> no

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
kind of it's a little bit more tough no

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.270 
kind of it's a little bit more tough no
so<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.569> one<00:03:51.720> just<00:03:51.900> slides<00:03:52.170> right<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.750 

there<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.310> go

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
there you go

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.520 
there you go
now<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.150> can't<00:04:00.450> use<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.720> by<00:04:00.900> itself<00:04:01.290> you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
now you can't use this by itself you

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.400 
now you can't use this by itself you
have<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.860> slide<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:03.269> hardshell<00:04:04.170> case

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
have to slide in the hardshell case

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.770 
have to slide in the hardshell case
which<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.190> right<00:04:05.280> here<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.780> what

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
which is this one right here and what

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.990 
which is this one right here and what
they<00:04:06.959> say<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.470> do<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.130> that<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.640> slide

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
they say to do is that you have to slide

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.070 
they say to do is that you have to slide
in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.330> bottom<00:04:09.750> part<00:04:09.930> first<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.830> kind<00:04:11.700> of

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
in the bottom part first and kind of

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.890 
in the bottom part first and kind of
place<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:13.440> there<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.120> what<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.150> did<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.660> use

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
place it in there and what I did to use

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.719 
place it in there and what I did to use
is<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.229> kind<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.560> pull<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.919> up<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.400> little<00:04:17.489> bit

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
is I kind of pull this up a little bit

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.030 
is I kind of pull this up a little bit
so<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.989> little<00:04:19.200> button<00:04:19.470> can<00:04:19.620> slide<00:04:19.889> in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
so that the little button can slide in

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.469 
so that the little button can slide in
easier<00:04:20.370> because<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.790> was<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> little<00:04:21.090> bit<00:04:21.269> hard

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
easier because it was a little bit hard

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.219 
easier because it was a little bit hard
once<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.930> got<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.200> in<00:04:22.380> its<00:04:23.160> slides<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.729> place

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
once you got that in its slides in place

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.760 
once you got that in its slides in place
and<00:04:25.229> there<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.500> go

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
and there you go

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.860 
and there you go
if<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:26.970> don't<00:04:27.150> really<00:04:27.240> know<00:04:27.419> how<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.600> put<00:04:27.780> it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
if you don't really know how to put it

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.050 
if you don't really know how to put it
on<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.139> kind<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.950> can<00:04:29.550> be<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.700> little<00:04:29.850> difficult

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
on it kind it can be a little difficult

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.000 
on it kind it can be a little difficult
because<00:04:30.450> all<00:04:30.750> these<00:04:30.900> buttons<00:04:31.680> will<00:04:31.860> go

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
because all these buttons will go

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.710 
because all these buttons will go
everywhere<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.880> little<00:04:33.090> things<00:04:33.510> right

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
everywhere and the little things right

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.690 
everywhere and the little things right
here<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.320> at<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.530> bottom<00:04:34.680> will<00:04:35.550> go

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
here and at the bottom will go

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.880 
here and at the bottom will go
everywhere<00:04:36.060> but<00:04:36.270> no<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.600> fine<00:04:36.750> now<00:04:37.410> my

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
everywhere but no it's fine now my

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.500 
everywhere but no it's fine now my
initial<00:04:38.280> impression<00:04:38.700> on<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:38.880> case<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.330> that

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
initial impression on the case is that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.290 
initial impression on the case is that
it's<00:04:40.140> really<00:04:40.710> thick<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.280> know<00:04:41.580> you're<00:04:42.060> getting

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
it's really thick I know you're getting

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.940 
it's really thick I know you're getting
a<00:04:42.390> really<00:04:42.690> good<00:04:42.840> quality<00:04:43.140> case<00:04:43.620> that<00:04:43.830> it's

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
a really good quality case that it's

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.590 
a really good quality case that it's
gonna<00:04:44.039> protect<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.580> against<00:04:44.910> these<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.479> know

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
gonna protect it against these you know

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.640 
gonna protect it against these you know
drops<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.530> won't<00:04:46.860> damage<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.280> foam<00:04:47.640> but<00:04:48.000> I

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
drops and it won't damage the foam but I

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.440 
drops and it won't damage the foam but I
personally<00:04:49.650> won't<00:04:49.830> sacrifice<00:04:50.100> size<00:04:51.000> and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
personally won't sacrifice size and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.810 
personally won't sacrifice size and
sleek<00:04:51.870> design<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.250> thinness<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.610> the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
sleek design and the thinness of the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.850 
sleek design and the thinness of the
phone<00:04:54.090> for<00:04:54.450> just<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.750> better<00:04:55.080> protecting<00:04:55.650> case

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
phone for just a better protecting case

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.800 
phone for just a better protecting case
in<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.610> case<00:04:56.669> I'll<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.120> use<00:04:57.450> one<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.660> these

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
in that case I'll just use one of these

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.290 
in that case I'll just use one of these
guys<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:59.010> spec<00:04:59.340> case<00:04:59.610> it's<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.910> lot<00:05:00.000> thinner

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
guys just a spec case it's a lot thinner

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.090 
guys just a spec case it's a lot thinner
and<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:00.630> protects<00:05:01.020> it<00:05:01.500> protects<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.919> foam

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
and it protects it protects the foam

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.279 
and it protects it protects the foam
fairly<00:05:02.400> well<00:05:02.550> but<00:05:02.940> if<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.870> doesn't<00:05:04.200> matter

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
fairly well but if that doesn't matter

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.290 
fairly well but if that doesn't matter
to<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.620> if<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:05.280> don't<00:05:05.430> mind<00:05:05.610> having<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:06.030> thick

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
to you if you don't mind having a thick

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.480 
to you if you don't mind having a thick
case<00:05:06.600> then<00:05:07.350> more<00:05:07.590> power<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.220> you're

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
case then more power to you you're

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.760 
case then more power to you you're
really<00:05:08.820> gonna<00:05:08.940> love<00:05:09.150> this<00:05:09.330> case<00:05:09.600> now<00:05:10.110> on<00:05:10.410> the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
really gonna love this case now on the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.100 
really gonna love this case now on the
Left<00:05:11.010> we<00:05:11.669> have<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.940> volume<00:05:12.270> buttons<00:05:12.570> we<00:05:13.080> have

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
Left we have the volume buttons we have

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.100 
Left we have the volume buttons we have
the<00:05:13.500> vibrate<00:05:14.190> switch<00:05:14.340> now<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.840> kind<00:05:16.020> of

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
the vibrate switch now I have to kind of

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.779 
the vibrate switch now I have to kind of
reach<00:05:16.289> in<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.560> little<00:05:16.770> bit<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.100> get<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.340> vibrate

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
reach in a little bit to get the vibrate

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.909 
reach in a little bit to get the vibrate
switch<00:05:17.910> which<00:05:18.240> is<00:05:18.389> totally<00:05:19.229> fine<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.680> know

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
switch which is totally fine you know

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.350 
switch which is totally fine you know
you're<00:05:20.070> getting<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.310> high<00:05:20.460> quality<00:05:20.490> case<00:05:21.060> so

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
you're getting a high quality case so

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.340 
you're getting a high quality case so
it's<00:05:21.510> something<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.750> you're<00:05:21.930> gonna<00:05:22.020> have<00:05:22.200> to

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
it's something that you're gonna have to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.810 
it's something that you're gonna have to
deal<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:22.740> because<00:05:22.919> it's<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.280> thicker<00:05:23.550> case

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
deal with because it's a thicker case

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.690 
deal with because it's a thicker case
now<00:05:24.450> at<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.720> top<00:05:25.080> I've<00:05:25.800> been<00:05:26.070> using<00:05:26.280> this<00:05:26.460> case
