00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hey here is the clip and in the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.919
 following small clip a few details 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.880
 to the galaxy s 5 show diverse 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.230
 stories like maybe the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.910
 fingerprint sensor or the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.950
 accessories of the sv cover which we here 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
 have in stock 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.279
 always when the mobile phone is not visible 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.350
 So now in the moment we have 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.480
 the movie in 4k with the galaxy s itself 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.189
 record in the result cdu practically then 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 the video quality and also do the same 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.260
 and so on and otherwise between us 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 to note 3 and let's see what 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.410
 We may start with 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.090
 The fingerprint scanner is one 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 special feature now and new 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 in the galaxy s 5 you have to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 just register the fingers 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 by not talking about that here 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 Things, as you can see, work right 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.670
 Well, it is really difficult 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.590
 final together who it I want 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 maybe should for one-handed 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.850
 operational so rum other but hold 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.410
 I like my cell phone and for me 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 personally that would not be more 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.920
 possible to wipe down with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.030
 can operate two hands 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 Of course, like the finger like this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 land where you just with the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.510
 side over the sensor a few times 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.549
 above that, in the variations, the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.049
 sometimes he says he can 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.549
 the middle of it rise 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.020
 but it would also go sideways that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.159
 should be as good as you have to 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.159
 save saved music 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 that should work so far 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.180
 we now have the fingerprint in it 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.460
 when you relax then just the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 possibility the finger down so 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 between as we have him before 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.829
 fingerprint 1 had saved 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 or you can then even if it 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.829
 then worked laterally under mix 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.630
 works also one has it also with 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.829
 so every time seen the short tests 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.170
 worked, maybe I did 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.189
 20 try it detects a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.020
 Maybe not if you look at it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.460
 stops and looks great from top to bottom 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.630
 above these sensors wipes 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.070
 works fine 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.060
 Personally , it is somehow too 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.470
 uncomfortable and I stick with it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.630
 any patterns or pin or 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 especially compare the whole yes 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.180
 was already hacked 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 as with the iphone in a short time 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.329
 were there any possibilities like that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.649
 you judge the whole thing and in that 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.000
 three, i want something like paypal 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.619
 shopping over fingerprint dear 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.319
 do not use and prefer my 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.640
 password a 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.689
 but everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.700
 decide that works on everyone 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.989
 falling idly considered next 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.299
 that you do not feel that way about it 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.310
 but wipes nice from above 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.510
 below about the device from what also 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.999
 special was sometimes laid that 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.499
 Samsung is the app in which you 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.189
 Step etc 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:29.530
 also then wonderfully coupled over the 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.769
 g2 you can count as his steps 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.280
 let or show calories 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.310
 leave etc 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 the whole thing works well, of course 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.540
 of course so if I have that now 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.859
 shake a few times or something 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.790
 she also meets the step number because 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.200
 the thing of course I think 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.639
 Of course you can not run there now 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.540
 it expected to be equal if 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.519
 I someday sensor shoe 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.709
 but would integrate it will definitely 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.250
 case very well and will for example 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.449
 as i can use this book cover there 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.250
 then you really want to work 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.180
 is on the phone on the display here 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.459
 above not only the time displayed 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.810
 but also get the step 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.129
 shows that then like it then 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.769
 would look as far as I put it 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.290
 we just have this for that reason 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.629
 can be the luck of the cover applies 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.280
 for note 3 already and I personally order 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.599
 that is quite clever because that is what it is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.419
 is protected behind and behind and me 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.280
 nevertheless this window already 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.599
 information as well as when calls me 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.689
 can also be closed in the way 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.650
 I go is that now everything 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.659
 connected is maybe just like that 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.629
 to see that the first 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.180
 cover also has this rubber lip here and 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.509
 even so the device continues to 67 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.560
 certified and this lightweight 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.989
 waterproofness is not waterproof 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.090
 It does not retain water resistance 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.199
 how much should not try it 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.479
 but I just wanted to say that 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.370
 It is precisely this seal that occurs, we are 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.439
 see again the normal sv 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.930
 cover not it will be the normal one 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.930
 backcover from too with this comedy 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.439
 have shown again and then comes 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.389
 Practically to the here is the back 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.750
 I have an extra well for that 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.759
 Heart rate monitor, of course, the gap 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.889
 for the speaker and everything in time 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:08.859
 is also protected by the fact that it is here 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.930
 an arm has survived something 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.150
 practically protected when it comes up 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.459
 and sometimes, of course, I can do it 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.599
 we use it once I can believe it 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.070
 and you still like the data 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.959
 example one can adjust the 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.699
 pedometer the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.949
 the water temperature and the time 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.259
 If I want I can be very easy too 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.669
 here surprise and then have one 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.319
 small camera which is then wonderful 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.580
 intact 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.400
 Also wonderful the photos I take 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.430
 very well look at again briefly 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.539
 everything works perfectly even if 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.669
 I am called 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.900
 get the info displayed on the display 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.210
 and can with closed cover because 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.560
 up here, of course, on at 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.970
 Integration was just about vision 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.610
 accept or agitate for conversation 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.930
 Works great when we're at it 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.460
 and I almost forgot 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.919
 Of course we can talk about the ess hero 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.110
 history also measure heart rate 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.430
 It's also a funny story 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.320
 just has behind 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.580
 or in other words the normal one 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.169
 Mostly it could be cell phones 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.099
 if a camera has an led there is 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.440
 even small doctors I of course that 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.729
 more bad than right 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.490
 could already have been here now 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.169
 extra below the normal camera yet 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.099
 Another camera with led created 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.620
 that you practically put your finger on it 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.569
 can put the whole thing here too 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.860
 if I see again and you should 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.979
 see you see the lamp 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.389
 it should measure measurement they remain 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.800
 over wisely does not work though 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:31.680
 the ten am curious how much I have 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:34.590
 probably way too much since 690 indicated 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.669
 Works perfectly where we are here 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.990
 Maybe I can do that again 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.099
 The animation was already there 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.020
 I can put a little value on that 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.180
 from the not yet because such a country they 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.669
 bit the books look on leaves 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.960
 optics when you finish the cover and 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.280
 back to power and as I said by 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.500
 that here is a super amoled 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.419
 Display was installed costs of course 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.080
 Half the screen also clear 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.669
 less electricity 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.969
 if that only appears in this cover 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.400
 is so much to the device that was already 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.659
 under little child of galaxy s 5 if 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.050
 she drove the video thumb after 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.880
 above 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.710
 Our channel is always happy 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.230
 subscribers and 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.490
 as I said in the review finds 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.230
 you then back on web.de 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.480
 the link can be found below in the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.590
 video description and see you 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.590
 next time is then
