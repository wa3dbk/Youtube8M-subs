00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.600 
have hyper Sonic and be in zone one act
1<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.040> this<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:12.909> tree<00:01:14.080> like<00:01:15.610> everyone

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
1 and this is a tree like everyone

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.240 
1 and this is a tree like everyone
is<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.060> when<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.240> go<00:01:17.390> into<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:17.930> tree<00:01:18.380> it

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
is that when you go into this tree it

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.760 
is that when you go into this tree it
chews<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.570> inside<00:01:21.050> but<00:01:21.530> what<00:01:21.680> you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
chews you the inside but what you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.930 
chews you the inside but what you
probably<00:01:21.800> didn't<00:01:22.490> know<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:28.520> didn't

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
probably didn't know is this it didn't

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.499 
probably didn't know is this it didn't
work<00:01:29.119> I'm<00:01:29.390> sorry<00:01:30.050> but<00:01:31.039> if<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:32.030> do<00:01:32.179> it<00:01:32.270> at<00:01:32.360> the

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
work I'm sorry but if you do it at the

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.200 
work I'm sorry but if you do it at the
right<00:01:32.539> precise<00:01:33.170> time<00:01:35.860> when<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.640> coming

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
right precise time when this is coming

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
right precise time when this is coming
up<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:40.280> does<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.300> same<00:01:41.330> thing<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:43.490> only

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
up this does the same thing it only

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.359 
up this does the same thing it only
works<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.570> those<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.110> are<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.350> best<00:01:45.619> so

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
works to those that are the best so

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.980 
works to those that are the best so
there's<00:01:46.550> a<00:01:46.640> challenge<00:01:46.940> for<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:49.899> here's<00:01:50.899> a

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
there's a challenge for you here's a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.480 
there's a challenge for you here's a
glitch<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.530> most<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.950> probably<00:01:52.310> already

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
glitch that most you probably already

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.399 
glitch that most you probably already
know<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.179> if<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.020> finish<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.860> UH<00:01:55.310> an<00:01:56.080> act<00:01:57.080> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
know but if you finish a UH an act and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.850 
know but if you finish a UH an act and
you<00:01:57.470> have<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:59.270> bubble<00:01:59.600> shield<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.710> just

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
you have the bubble shield you can just

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.150 
you have the bubble shield you can just
keep<00:02:01.270> bubbling<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.289> won't<00:02:03.530> make<00:02:03.739> you<00:02:03.800> go

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
keep bubbling and it won't make you go

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.910 
keep bubbling and it won't make you go
down<00:02:04.459> and<00:02:05.140> have<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.410> see<00:02:06.619> all<00:02:06.770> your

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
down and have to see all your

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.470 
down and have to see all your
information<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:08.000> once<00:02:08.149> you<00:02:08.300> stop<00:02:10.180> it<00:02:11.180> does

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
information but once you stop it does

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.059 
information but once you stop it does
all<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:14.230> some<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.379> you<00:02:15.470> might<00:02:15.620> know<00:02:15.830> this

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
all that some of you might know this

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.420

glitch but some of you might not after
you<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:19.910> completed<00:02:20.120> zone<00:02:20.750> 1<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:22.459> um

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
you have completed zone 1 you um

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.710 
you have completed zone 1 you um
knuckles<00:02:25.069> will<00:02:25.370> come<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.910> try<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.450> drop<00:02:26.660> a

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.770 
knuckles will come and try and drop a
bridge<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.250> get<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.640> next<00:02:28.819> zone<00:02:29.120> if

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
bridge so you get to the next zone if

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.080 
bridge so you get to the next zone if
you<00:02:29.959> keep<00:02:30.170> pressing<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.580> move<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.750> left

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.460 
you keep pressing a and move to the left
you<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.270> jump<00:02:35.540> up<00:02:40.900> here's<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.989> glitch<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.410> I

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
you can jump up here's a glitch that I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.330 
you can jump up here's a glitch that I
just<00:02:42.739> actually<00:02:42.950> discovered<00:02:43.610> today<00:02:44.050> well<00:02:45.340> when

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
just actually discovered today well when

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.180 
just actually discovered today well when
you're<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.670> zone<00:02:47.269> 2<00:02:47.629> and<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.830> know<00:02:48.950> there's

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
you go super fast well if you have a

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.390 
you go super fast well if you have a
bubble<00:02:53.629> shield<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.500> keep<00:02:54.680> doing<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.099> near

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
bubble shield you keep doing this near

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.070 
bubble shield you keep doing this near
one
