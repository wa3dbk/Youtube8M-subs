00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.330
 a first cultivar the first fpso 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.730
 important gene in the market that was 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 launched in the 80's is brachiaria 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.470
 brizantha sending get famous 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.710
 My gosh, it 's a present known by 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.650
 many ranchers to Brazil then was 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.439
 released or here in brazil her life 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 africa glass makes calls on babo and she 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.730
 was initially introduced in the region 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.230
 de piranema who leaves Sao Paulo and this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.710
 have some portfolios 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 is mainly the high 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.059
 production of dry matter that it reaches 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 produce from 10 to 14 tons of matter 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.910
 drought per hectare per year can get 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.070
 up to 12% crude protein and the main 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.530
 main feature 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 really made her cultivate it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 take off if she had a large 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 here in the soybean market in brazil 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.160
 It was just that she has a good letter 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.559
 they forage this great production is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049
 a forage plant that it is is 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.729
 perch before it 's tough attack of 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.310
 insects mainly the ant 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.350
 no cutter nor the saúva who if you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.409
 have a step of bacterium brizantha at 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.229
 ant there is no participation and another 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.689
 characteristic that is also influenced by 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.880
 dissemination in the diffusion and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.490
 use of this cultivar was precisely 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 she is resistant to the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 pasture and this resistance caused 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 large regions, mainly in the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.009
 brazilian cerrado was used 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.540
 peace through age so today is so 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 talking about the bacterium aimed at 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.670
 marandu and also the participation of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.350
 matsuda in this release is absurd 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.170
 in the 1980s there was a large 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.970
 participation of this release 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.210
 mainly because it was the company that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.220
 available quantities at that time. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 trade in seeds through the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.780
 production to the motherland of the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.909
 seed then this factor of having only 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 available on the market at the time of 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.579
 release is also the factor 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.940
 important that matsuda's participation was 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.280
 precisely in this one is commercialization 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.780
 availability of the seed that the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.700
 market is the success that until the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.340
 and this brizantha cultivar buraqueira 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.590
 sent known as braquiarão this 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.040
 have been registered there 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.370
 is on May 10, 1999 and has the number 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.290
 registered 02 25 in the ministry of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 then you can see that it is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.480
 a launch of the 80 's has been 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.910
 registered in the 90's when it changed 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.410
 the law of protection type of cultivars 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.410
 when the law of seed changed
