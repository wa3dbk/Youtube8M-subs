00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
think about a lot of our moves then if

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
think about a lot of our moves then if
it<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> back<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.350> core<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.189> Jake<00:02:05.430> or

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it the back and core it's a Jake or

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.969 
it the back and core it's a Jake or
system<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> moves<00:02:07.469> were<00:02:07.649> coming

down

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
down

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
bringing up our body raising it down

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.510 
bringing up our body raising it down
making<00:02:18.030> moves<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.750> benefit<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.860> we're

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
making moves a benefit because we're

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.820 
making moves a benefit because we're
going<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.940> back<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.510> how<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:21.870> are<00:02:22.170> each<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
going right back to how we are each and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.860 
going right back to how we are each and
every<00:02:23.100> day<00:02:23.130> think<00:02:23.910> about<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.690> should

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
every day think about it you should

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.050 
every day think about it you should
train<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.860> way<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.070> play<00:02:26.460> we're<00:02:26.850> all

athletes<00:02:27.630> our<00:02:27.900> desk<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.860> our<00:02:29.010> playing<00:02:29.310> field

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
athletes our desk is our playing field

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
athletes our desk is our playing field
and<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.300> J<00:02:30.450> court<00:02:30.720> system<00:02:31.050> is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
and that's what the J court system is

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.260 
and that's what the J court system is
great<00:02:31.980> about<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.640> different<00:02:33.180> from

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
great about and it's different from

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.660 
great about and it's different from
other<00:02:33.600> DVD<00:02:34.200> systems<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.100> practical

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
other DVD systems because it's practical

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.340 
other DVD systems because it's practical
and<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.180> relevant<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.020> going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.200> make

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
and it's relevant and it's going to make

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.500 
and it's relevant and it's going to make
you<00:02:37.560> healthier<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.310> happier<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.390> can

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
you healthier and happier and it can

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.690 
you healthier and happier and it can
find<00:02:39.780> space<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.380> me<00:02:40.620> 20<00:02:40.920> minutes<00:02:41.070> so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
find space for me 20 minutes so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.090 
find space for me 20 minutes so
basically<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.420> don't<00:02:42.600> use<00:02:42.780> equipment<00:02:43.140> how
