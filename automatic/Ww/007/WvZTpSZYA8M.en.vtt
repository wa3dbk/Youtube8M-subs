which is kind of frustrating um but yeah
so<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> talked<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> Kevin<00:00:52.559> earlier<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.010> asked

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so I talked to Kevin earlier and I asked

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
so I talked to Kevin earlier and I asked
him<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.640> his<00:00:53.820> phantom<00:00:54.210> ii<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> he

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
him how his phantom ii was going and he

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
him how his phantom ii was going and he
said<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> little<00:00:55.860> underwhelming<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
said it was a little underwhelming and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.010 
said it was a little underwhelming and
we<00:00:57.600> both<00:00:57.719> agreed<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.140> since<00:01:00.020> its

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
we both agreed that since its

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.959 
we both agreed that since its
distributed<00:01:01.649> between<00:01:01.829> three<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.430> four<00:01:02.579> hotels

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
distributed between three or four hotels

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.719 
distributed between three or four hotels
like<00:01:03.300> everybody's<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.930> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> spread<00:01:04.500> out

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
like everybody's just kind of spread out

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
like everybody's just kind of spread out
so<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> hard<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.799> everything

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
so it's kind of hard to see everything

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.620 
so it's kind of hard to see everything
you<00:01:08.310> want<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.210> there's<00:01:09.390> certain

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you want to see I think there's certain

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.510 
you want to see I think there's certain

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
steampunk columns at our hotel and then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 
steampunk columns at our hotel and then
we're<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> there's<00:01:15.990> definitely

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
we're all here and there's definitely

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
we're all here and there's definitely
it's<00:01:16.619> definitely<00:01:16.650> sparks<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.850> fanime

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's definitely sparks and I know fanime

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420

is<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:18.600> popular<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> little

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
is really popular so it's a little

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.590 
is really popular so it's a little
frustrating<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
frustrating because then we just have to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
frustrating because then we just have to
walk<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.110> forth<00:01:22.350> everywhere<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
walk back and forth everywhere and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.679 
walk back and forth everywhere and
that's<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.640> how<00:01:23.820> Kevin<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> work

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that's not how Kevin and I like to work

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.380 
that's not how Kevin and I like to work
we<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> stay<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.590> one

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
we kind of like to stay in one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.290 
we kind of like to stay in one
large<00:01:27.080> little<00:01:27.740> zones<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.610> was<00:01:28.729> an<00:01:28.850> oxymoron

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
large little zones that was an oxymoron

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.950 
large little zones that was an oxymoron
but<00:01:29.450> that's<00:01:29.600> okay<00:01:29.780> um<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:31.400> it's<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.180> little<00:01:32.570> okay

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
but that's okay um so it's a little okay

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280 
but that's okay um so it's a little okay
we<00:01:33.350> went<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.010> exhibition<00:01:34.790> hall<00:01:35.290> he's

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
we went to the exhibition hall he's

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.930 
we went to the exhibition hall he's
pretty<00:01:36.470> big<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.979> think<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.430> personally<00:01:37.880> think

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
pretty big I think I personally think

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.310 
pretty big I think I personally think
secure<00:01:38.240> funds<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.540> bigger<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.140> might<00:01:39.290> be

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
secure funds is bigger but that might be

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.780 
secure funds is bigger but that might be
because<00:01:39.440> they<00:01:39.830> combine<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.280> artist<00:01:40.610> alley

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
because they combine the artist alley

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.710 
because they combine the artist alley
