00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 here is morgan 21 years old student in Grenoble 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.589
 management School 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.150
 for some time morgane hears 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 much talk about the school of the future 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080
 but what exactly is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 what are these robots that are going to do 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.299
 groceries 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.980
 Besides, will there always be 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.510
 classrooms are we going to get 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.369
 find with embedded chips in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.050
 the brain not of course 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 but then what will change for 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.150
 she pedagogy will not disappear at 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 otherwise it will be custom based 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.769
 on the transmission of knowledge 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.540
 skills and know how to be in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.700
 the school of the future place to the multi 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 pedagogy with these adapted tools and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 many services associated the mook for 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 lifelong learning 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.730
 the social learning or morgane will learn 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.789
 as other students 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.489
 the certification the gamification for 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.559
 motivate and evaluate classes inverted 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.629
 or morgan will be able to implement 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.579
 the knowledge she has acquired 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.770
 serious games but also the moba and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.010
 learning to learn everywhere and the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 learning by doing to experiment with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.220
 classrooms do not go either 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 disappear but they will no longer be 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 only place of learning morgan will be able 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 learn here or there or there and there and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.140
 even there but what will she learn 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.330
 just finance management and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
 marketing of course but also of the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.490
 geopolitics of architectural design 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 computer language theater 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.920
 brief various disciplines that him 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.990
 will serve to be operational evolve 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.259
 horizontally and vertically in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 his business not be surprised be 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 criticism learn and develop his 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 mobility and autonomy 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 what will change also is the way 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.369
 which morgan will learn by cooperating in 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.159
 June 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.979
 by experimenting while working at 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.560
 distance and creating his own courses 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.409
 but what does it look like this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 school of the future one can imagine that the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.100
 traditional classroom will be little 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.930
 replaced by new places of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.399
 life and studies to foster 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.670
 learning in all its forms 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.980
 traditional informal social but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.170
 especially practical and collaborative 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.390
 there will be teaching rooms at 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.640
 other distance for work 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 collaborative or some 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.560
 equipped with the latest technologies 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.450
 a fab lab to learn how to create 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.180
 creative rooms where we can 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.400
 speak on the walls of places for 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.890
 debate but also to resolve 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 daily problems of short morgane 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.630
 many technologies and services 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.760
 but it is above all the organization the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 vision men and women who 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.480
 will make the difference 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.980
 morgane will also use more and more 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.730
 tools that are already at its 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
 disposition 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.540
 blogs crowdsourcing tables 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.390
 interactive 3d printers the mook 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.940
 educational apps and its 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 digital binder but she will also have 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.740
 need for learning management system 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.320
 an educational platform that will be the 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.180
 central core of learning a painting 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.310
 single board to follow the entire 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.500
 morgane schooling what she did 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.000
 where she is on what she has to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.460
 progress in an environment 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.860
 personal learning to manage the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.110
 learning at his own pace a tool 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.330
 intelligent mobile is above all 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.430
 customize through all these 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.750
 innovations the school of the future will prepare 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.580
 even better morgan to his life 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.330
 Professional and Grenoble School of 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.700
 management 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.970
 precursor in this area will be there for 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.970
 accompany
