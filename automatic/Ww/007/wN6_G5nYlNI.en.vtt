00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.339
 Hello, this is a review of the application 

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.339
 the hands of the sport saved not lying with us van 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.119
 let's see how it works 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.119
 This is how the application looks like this. 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.259
 but in general, at first glance, this is normal 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.820
 the file manager is like a patriot son 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.519
 sl ooo stroymontazh 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.019
 but it's not exactly like you see here 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.199
 there are various unfamiliar to some 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.749
 folders 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.169
 these country folders in the phone's memory and 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.689
 hidden from us 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.239
 but you need for example when you connect the phone 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.530
 computer 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.820
 available on the fifth folder 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.080
 and here we go in the basement 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.090
 it's already 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.280
 but more and more familiar 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.040
 i.e. these are all folders 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 times our memory cards 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 percent 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.290
 and this is already 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.220
 us inaccessible folders 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.190
 in general, just like that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.000
 do not get access to them 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 this application attacked us lets do 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 it is for him we also need a rub right 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.600
 not so without them 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.900
 work normally 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.030
 So for such a project system folder 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.690
 Sudak came in order to tell us about 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.650
 what 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.470
 but 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.210
 this application is basically 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060
 used to remove not 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.070
 we need 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.049
 attachment 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.800
 exactly built 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.200
 such as 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.080
 for example 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
 and huge it is quite easy to remove 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.150
 remains 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 we press david but that's how long ago 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.280
 will disappear from your phone but it is not yet 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.270
 everything 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.010
 it means you need here 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.250
 we can and moves the application for example 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.190
 renamed in general, everything is as usual 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.110
 and so but we will continue 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.160
 percent 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.710
 if three programs 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.950
 which we can not remove here for example 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.550
 opel jeff 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.270
 point and yet hours vova 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.390
 will show 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.590
 also don’t remove the fund 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 this applications 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.360
 but then you see 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.490
 occupy 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.260
 more than the rest 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.760
 yes we have it by the way here because of the exchange 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.760
 and the first measure is percentage written 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.459
 but the operation has so far removed this shell 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.010
 our phone, that is, I was left without 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.799
 future changes 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.059
 be it that 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.129
 about the output main screen 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.290
 Well, then I had to reflash 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.439
 the phone in general does not delete it 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.240
 attachment 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.499
 application list times 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.709
 which can be deleted on which you can not 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.200
 You can Madinat site for example p 500 point 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.659
 rub 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.279
 but I took them there anyway 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.999
 Well, that means that the site also has a p500 dot ru 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.719
 detailed instructions 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.499
 midnight and let's continue 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:49.659
 percent 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.949
 but I think you understand how to delete here 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.139
 I also want to note that we have here 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.139
 such a rental office is silent era regiment 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.219
 we want you to them 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 on the white background was written exactly air floor 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.779
 not like now 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.169
 otherwise you can delete applications 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.809
 you know 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.499
 all now he can delete applications 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.609
 remember how it should look like 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.739
 Otherwise, all the same, no problems deleting 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.699
 application frees to place 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.149
 but it’s easier for us to have a pitt timak menu and 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.389
 the like 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.789
 it means but there are different settings 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:29.760
 programs 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.590
 two months all no matter the line 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.329
 of great value 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.029
 does not have 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.460
 here you see 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.129
 these settings 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.929
 in general, they generally can not go 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.259
 right away 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.249
 use the program 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.239
 but also all kinds of other things 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.109
 that is, we can 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.479
 something dollars and create 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.349
 file for example that there you will see exit 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.849
 applications in general everything is as usual 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.559
 and the search is also for convenience 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.629
 but that is exactly how it worked 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.779
 the prime minister's wife has already sold part of himself 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:04.849
 applications 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.859
 with them tuned of course 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.299
 so 1 three floors classmates 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.989
 Facebook 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.539
 These applications have been deleted exactly still quite Amba 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:15.949
 poster 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.959
 but also delete 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.969
 several applications 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.159
 but in general 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.659
 setup 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.199
 a little easier 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.650
 but attack if you built applications 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.520
 not very disturbed or even needed 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.240
 Well, you can not remove them 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.270
 Here I became some percent 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.450
 For example, males offices this is an application 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.289
 important 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.599
 in case it is convenient to use as 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.240
 Pavel Manager 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.949
 here I left for myself their example 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:44.920
 percent 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.730
 various other st already voices polish 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.939
 I decided to delete the lech cards too 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.439
 about something about what applications angle like 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.990
 it is not very desirable to remove 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.690
 but overall I think this review he helped 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.830
 deal with 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.830
 application running forum 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.699
 the question you will not have on 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.349
 7 they will arise then you can naturally 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.449
 ask them not 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:10.919
 all good bye
