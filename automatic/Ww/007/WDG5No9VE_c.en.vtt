00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
media tech chipset as me to take 67

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
media tech chipset as me to take 67
something<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:35.820> pretty<00:00:35.940> sure<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.450> overall

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
something I'm pretty sure so overall

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.810 
something I'm pretty sure so overall
it's<00:00:37.800> better<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.700> more

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it's better it's a little bit more

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's better it's a little bit more
expensive<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:40.020> bit<00:00:40.110> smaller<00:00:40.350> display

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
expensive a little bit smaller display

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.690 
expensive a little bit smaller display
4.7<00:00:41.309> inch<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.760> let's<00:00:42.239> go

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
4.7 inch so let's go

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
4.7 inch so let's go
so<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.090> Xperia<00:00:45.420> e4<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> left<00:00:46.649> side

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
so the Xperia e4 here on the left side

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.910 
so the Xperia e4 here on the left side
has<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.340> 5-inch<00:00:47.700> display<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.770> also

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
has a 5-inch display and you can also

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.630 
has a 5-inch display and you can also
see<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:51.750> display<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:52.890> seems<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
see that display right now seems to be

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
see that display right now seems to be
lit<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:53.820> better<00:00:54.090> heroes<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> e4g<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
lit with better heroes on the e4g if you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:09.770 
lit with better heroes on the e4g if you
ask<00:00:56.489> me<00:00:57.620> which<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> pretty<00:00:59.039> nice<00:01:07.189> see<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.780> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
ask me which is pretty nice see here is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.420 
ask me which is pretty nice see here is
there<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.260> difference<00:01:11.479> yes<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:13.890> already<00:01:14.040> have

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there any difference yes we already have

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
there any difference yes we already have
a<00:01:14.850> Fuji<00:01:15.689> upper<00:01:16.110> running<00:01:17.060> wait<00:01:18.080> foster<00:01:19.080> or

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
a Fuji upper running wait foster or

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.789 
a Fuji upper running wait foster or
maybe<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.610> super<00:01:20.970> foster<00:01:21.420> well<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:24.799> so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
maybe not super foster well it is so

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.510 
maybe not super foster well it is so
different

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
different

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210 
different
Oh<00:01:26.610> still<00:01:27.540> laggy<00:01:27.810> feel<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.770> bit<00:01:28.920> slow

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
Oh still laggy feel a little bit slow

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
Oh still laggy feel a little bit slow
there<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.479> yeah<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.900> definitely<00:01:31.020> see

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there and I yeah I can definitely see

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
there and I yeah I can definitely see
that<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.650> display<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.040> way<00:01:32.280> better<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.640> on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that the display is way better here on

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
that the display is way better here on
the<00:01:33.540> Xperia<00:01:33.869> e4<00:01:33.990> g<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.799> there's<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.430> more

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the Xperia e4 g so there's a lot more

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
the Xperia e4 g so there's a lot more
like<00:01:36.270> value<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.380> seem<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.799> getting

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
like value that you seem to be getting

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
like value that you seem to be getting
in<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.759> also<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.509> game

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
in this one and also that the game

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
in this one and also that the game
experience<00:01:40.290> probably<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.979> better<00:01:41.400> with

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
experience probably will be better with

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.840 
experience probably will be better with
the<00:01:42.210> malike<00:01:42.600> GPU<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.770> Quartus<00:01:44.399> 850

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the malike GPU and the Quartus 850

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.090 
the malike GPU and the Quartus 850
through<00:01:45.060> both<00:01:45.329> fires<00:01:45.659> quad<00:01:45.899> core<00:01:46.110> stood<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
through both fires quad core stood up is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.080 
through both fires quad core stood up is
a<00:01:47.220> seven<00:01:48.200> one<00:01:49.200> point<00:01:49.409> three<00:01:49.590> yards<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
a seven one point three yards but you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.770 
a seven one point three yards but you
can<00:01:51.210> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.110> terms<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.590> UI<00:01:53.780> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
can kind of see here in terms of UI that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289 
can kind of see here in terms of UI that
they<00:01:54.930> both<00:01:55.110> seems<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.399> featuring<00:01:56.909> think

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
they both seems to be featuring think

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.050 
they both seems to be featuring think
kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.649> similar<00:01:58.649> Xperia<00:01:59.869> Xperia

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
kind of similar Xperia Xperia

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.389 
kind of similar Xperia Xperia
so<00:02:03.060> let's<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.659> go<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.829> setting<00:02:05.189> so

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
so let's just go in here to setting so

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.520 
so let's just go in here to setting so
you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.790> look<00:02:06.270> pretty<00:02:06.780> familiar<00:02:07.459> similar

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
you can see look pretty familiar similar

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.470 
you can see look pretty familiar similar
yeah<00:02:11.780> mt6582

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
yeah mt6582

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.710 
yeah mt6582
and<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.670> doesn't<00:02:15.879> even<00:02:16.060> say<00:02:16.450> that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and this one it doesn't even say that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.619 
and this one it doesn't even say that
and<00:02:17.590> processor<00:02:18.250> info<00:02:18.459> interesting<00:02:19.239> how<00:02:19.390> they

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
and processor info interesting how they

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.720 
and processor info interesting how they
