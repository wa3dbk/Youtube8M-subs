all<00:00:01.260> right<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.740> OSU<00:00:02.070> 67<00:00:03.770> haven't<00:00:04.770> made<00:00:04.859> a

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
all right this is OSU 67 haven't made a

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.010 
all right this is OSU 67 haven't made a
video<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.220> while<00:00:05.450> Allen<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.540> haven't<00:00:06.899> gone

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
video a while Allen I haven't gone

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.080 
video a while Allen I haven't gone
shooting<00:00:07.529> because<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.130> kind<00:00:08.940> of

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
shooting because we're kind of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.049 
shooting because we're kind of
conserving<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.750> Miami<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.410> pretty<00:00:10.679> expensive

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
conserving in Miami is pretty expensive

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.419 
conserving in Miami is pretty expensive
so<00:00:12.059> we've<00:00:12.330> been<00:00:12.450> working<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> father-son

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
so we've been working on a father-son

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.689 
so we've been working on a father-son
project<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:16.369> thought<00:00:17.369> it'd<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.520> kind<00:00:17.670> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
project and thought it'd be kind of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.439 
project and thought it'd be kind of
interesting<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> stick<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.710> twin<00:00:20.449> vertical

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
interesting to stick a twin vertical

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.830 
interesting to stick a twin vertical
twin<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.020> rather<00:00:22.710> horizontal<00:00:23.369> twin<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.840> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
twin a rather horizontal twin on a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.589 
twin a rather horizontal twin on a
go-kart<00:00:25.789> just<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.000> its<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> giggles<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:29.599> Alan

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
go-kart just for its and giggles so Alan

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.290 
go-kart just for its and giggles so Alan
I<00:00:30.840> rebuild<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.769> command<00:00:32.780> 22<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:35.149> Alan<00:00:36.149> had

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
I rebuild a command 22 and Alan had

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
I rebuild a command 22 and Alan had
found<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.780> go-kart<00:00:37.290> frame<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> needed<00:00:38.040> some

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
found a go-kart frame that needed some

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.900 
found a go-kart frame that needed some
work<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:39.000> cheap<00:00:39.950> as<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.790> can

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
work that we got pretty cheap as you can

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.709 
work that we got pretty cheap as you can
see<00:00:42.120> I've<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.610> fuel<00:00:44.610> tank<00:00:44.850> mounted<00:00:45.660> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
see I've got the fuel tank mounted in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.240 
see I've got the fuel tank mounted in
the<00:00:45.780> back<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.230> granted<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the back now granted this is just a

the back now granted this is just a
mock-up<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.239> checking<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.719> if

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
mock-up we're just checking to see if

mock-up we're just checking to see if
this<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.379> work<00:00:50.480> got<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> fuel

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this will actually work got the fuel

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
this will actually work got the fuel

about<00:01:19.409> $150<00:01:20.189> clutch<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.990> had<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> friend<00:01:22.470> who<00:01:22.939> was

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
about $150 clutch I had a friend who was

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.620 
about $150 clutch I had a friend who was
a<00:01:23.970> machinist<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.630> machined

opposed to having it on the crank this
clutch<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.460> about<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> hundred<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.210> sixty

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
clutch is about a hundred and sixty

clutch is about a hundred and sixty
bucks

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
bucks

it's<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.340> centrifugal<00:01:44.759> clutch<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it's a centrifugal clutch that the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's a centrifugal clutch that the
weights<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:48.210> spin<00:01:48.540> outwards<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.520> the

up contacting the other side of the drum

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.920 
up contacting the other side of the drum
going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> check<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.219> works

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.560 

like<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.020> said<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.500> mock-up<00:02:05.360> go<00:02:06.360> ahead

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
like I said it's just a mock-up go ahead

00:02:06.570 --> 00:03:09.930 
like I said it's just a mock-up go ahead
and<00:02:07.429> start<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.520> up

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.400 

got<00:03:10.940> adjust<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> fuel<00:03:11.660> mixture<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.170> that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
got adjust the fuel mixture on that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.820 
got adjust the fuel mixture on that
still<00:03:12.830> running<00:03:13.129> a<00:03:13.190> little<00:03:13.340> bit<00:03:13.519> rich<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:15.080> this

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
still running a little bit rich but this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.750 
still running a little bit rich but this
clutch<00:03:16.099> as<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.640> engages<00:03:17.540> around<00:03:18.530> 4000<00:03:19.340> rpm

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
clutch as it is engages around 4000 rpm

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.930 
clutch as it is engages around 4000 rpm
so<00:03:20.720> we've<00:03:21.140> got<00:03:21.349> to<00:03:21.650> add<00:03:22.129> some<00:03:22.430> counter<00:03:22.730> weights

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
so we've got to add some counter weights

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.870 
so we've got to add some counter weights
on<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.750> adjust<00:03:24.349> these<00:03:25.310> adjusters

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
on to it and adjust these adjusters

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.839 
on to it and adjust these adjusters
right<00:03:26.360> here<00:03:26.720> all<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.650> way<00:03:27.739> around<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.580> get<00:03:28.730> it

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
right here all the way around to get it

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.070 
right here all the way around to get it
so<00:03:28.970> engage<00:03:29.360> around<00:03:29.569> 1,400<00:03:30.500> rpm<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.840> right

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
so engage around 1,400 rpm just right

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.820 
so engage around 1,400 rpm just right
above<00:03:33.349> where<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.680> item<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.069> set<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.580> this

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
above where the item is set on this

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.150 
above where the item is set on this
anyway

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
anyway

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160 
anyway
we'll<00:03:37.790> make<00:03:38.209> another<00:03:38.269> video<00:03:38.720> when<00:03:38.900> we<00:03:38.959> get

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
we'll make another video when we get

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.710 
we'll make another video when we get
