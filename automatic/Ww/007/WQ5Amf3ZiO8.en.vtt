00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.099
 we all have children who are sometimes 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 a little painful and I have a boy who 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.760
 is particularly tenuous for 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 getting dressed in the morning he's struggling to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 choose his clothes nothing that will he wants 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.859
 not the masters and then if it's not okay 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.289
 then there are several ways of 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.800
 get around the problem and then get there 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 to make a little more joyous this 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 moment that is often stressful for 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.829
 all my past time to leave then 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 one of the things that works very well 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.649
 it is to make a market where we take the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 clothes and we install them and we say yes 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.270
 hello the open market who knows they 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 can buy clothes which is who 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.329
 wants to buy my pants and then bang 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 and my boy comes and goes and then 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.629
 choose his pants he buys me it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.190
 pay me we will make the choice that the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.629
 socks did the same thing with 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 the sweaters and in the end it's 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.070
 not the fight everyone is having fun and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.979
 then he chooses very quickly his 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.200
 business since he just bought 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 there is a little here is this game idea 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 it is true that children learn 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 a lot by the game is a lot for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.400
 they see like to play here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:31.140
 for children and learn by the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.729
 day yes and boys boys so 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.780
 kids love playing and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.700
 after our friends from jean the kids 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.610
 after this nice shot by the game we like 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.560
 many play and another so so 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.420
 to do for for the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.360
 yeah make them a little more playful this 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.960
 moment of choice to make people talk 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:05.619
 clothes then for example pants 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.619
 who is talking we can talk about the time 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.269
 that's another way to do it 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.170
 talk about the clothes and then the slopes to 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.330
 we talk to each other and 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.610
 that they say you think he's going to me 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 choose months good no one you're not 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 very beautiful you have more buttons that 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.580
 are not even place in the right place 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.900
 yeah but you're holed and I do not 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.970
 do not think he likes holes but you 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 you anyway it looks like you have 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.230
 more colors you saw he went to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.840
 colors finally brief you see the idea of 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 play staging a little bit 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.130
 the clothes for them to come alive and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.390
 that it becomes a little tells him what 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.640
 fun and it always helps them better 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.110
 to choose their clothes and to dress and 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.160
 then another time I'll talk to you 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.400
 like you do the same thing but at 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.400
 table
