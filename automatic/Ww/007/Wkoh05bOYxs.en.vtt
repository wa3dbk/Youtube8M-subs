say for alopecia it affects one percent

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.820 
say for alopecia it affects one percent
of<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.270> population<00:05:23.390> well<00:05:24.230> this<00:05:24.470> sounds

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
of the population well this sounds

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.260 
of the population well this sounds
really<00:05:25.100> high<00:05:25.370> but<00:05:25.640> i<00:05:25.670> think<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:25.910> also

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
really high but i think that also

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.120 
really high but i think that also
includes<00:05:26.600> those<00:05:27.410> people<00:05:27.800> who<00:05:27.920> might<00:05:28.070> just

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
includes those people who might just

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.860 
includes those people who might just
have<00:05:28.400> like<00:05:28.550> one<00:05:28.820> bout<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.420> where<00:05:29.570> they<00:05:29.660> lose

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
have like one bout of it where they lose

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.440 
have like one bout of it where they lose
a<00:05:30.170> few<00:05:30.770> patches<00:05:31.070> of<00:05:31.280> hair<00:05:31.430> but<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.240> know<00:05:32.390> still
