00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.740
 the oral cavity possesses one of the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.170
 concentrations of microorganisms 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.850
 high of the human body that's why 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.920
 fundamental in dentistry that the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.930
 material used in each patient be 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.930
 correctly sterilized previously 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.919
 Y 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.489
 once the exploration is done , 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
 submerge in instruments in a bucket 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.059
 with a disinfectant liquid for 10 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.059
 minutes before a wash 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.060
 after this time will proceed to 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.890
 Instrument cleaning 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.890
 a mechanical way or a manual way 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 one of the options of the mechanical route 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.330
 consists of immersing the material in the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.380
 Ultrasound cuvette one time 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.380
 specified by the manufacturer 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.750
 Another option of the mechanical route is the use 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.590
 of a thermos disinfects dora at 93 degrees 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 for 10 minutes 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.730
 ah 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.730
 ah 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.720
 Manually wash the material with water 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 and soap using a brush 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.060
 now the instruments are well dried 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.680
 the stock exchanges are identified 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.680
 sterilization 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.320
 and they are sealed in the traysealer 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.170
 then all instruments are deposited in 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.170
 the autoclave in a program at 134 degrees 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.550
 When the sterilization is finished , 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.710
 proceed to storage 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.430
 bag sterilization has a 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.430
 validity of one year 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.870
 ah 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.349
 ah 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.349
