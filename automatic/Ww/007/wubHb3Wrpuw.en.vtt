as the same size screen as the Galaxy s4
at<00:00:02.820> five<00:00:03.060> inches<00:00:03.270> so<00:00:04.110> it's<00:00:04.350> just<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.620> little<00:00:04.859> bit

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
at five inches so it's just a little bit

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.790 
at five inches so it's just a little bit
smaller<00:00:05.310> than<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.759> s5<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:07.189> you<00:00:08.189> can<00:00:08.400> see<00:00:08.700> and

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
smaller than the s5 as you can see and

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.680 
smaller than the s5 as you can see and
as<00:00:10.800> well<00:00:11.010> similar<00:00:11.280> side-by-side<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.210> Nexus<00:00:12.509> 5

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
as well similar side-by-side the Nexus 5

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.780 
as well similar side-by-side the Nexus 5
is<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.200> bit<00:00:13.349> thicker<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.160> point<00:00:14.490> three

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
is just a bit thicker at point three

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.939 
is just a bit thicker at point three
four<00:00:15.120> inches<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:17.600> next<00:00:18.600> up<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> HTC

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
four inches so next up we have the HTC

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.310 
four inches so next up we have the HTC
One<00:00:20.220> m7<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.720> generation<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
One m7 which is the first generation of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.700 
One m7 which is the first generation of
HTC<00:00:22.800> One<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> brand<00:00:24.029> new<00:00:24.119> device<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:25.320> HTC

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
HTC One not the brand new device the HTC

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.370 
HTC One not the brand new device the HTC
One<00:00:25.890> screen<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.400> only<00:00:26.490> 4.7<00:00:27.359> inches<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.930> while

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
One screen is only 4.7 inches and while

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810 
One screen is only 4.7 inches and while
it<00:00:28.500> might<00:00:28.619> look<00:00:28.800> closer<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.279> size<00:00:29.310> than<00:00:29.670> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it might look closer in size than that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.339 
it might look closer in size than that
it's<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> device<00:00:31.050> has<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it's just because the device has a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's just because the device has a
pretty<00:00:31.710> wide<00:00:31.920> black<00:00:32.160> bezels<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.210> side<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
pretty wide black bezels on the side of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
pretty wide black bezels on the side of
the<00:00:33.540> device<00:00:33.660> along<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.350> physical<00:00:34.710> buttons

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the device along with physical buttons

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.410 
the device along with physical buttons
on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> bottom<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.120> actually

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
on the bottom and it's actually

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.290 
on the bottom and it's actually
significantly<00:00:37.050> thicker<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.559> 0.37<00:00:38.550> inches<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
significantly thicker at 0.37 inches and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.680 
significantly thicker at 0.37 inches and
lastly<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> iPhone<00:00:41.010> 5<00:00:41.570> so<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
lastly we have the iPhone 5 so this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.690 
lastly we have the iPhone 5 so this
device<00:00:42.960> obviously<00:00:43.500> looks<00:00:43.710> absolutely<00:00:44.100> tiny

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
device obviously looks absolutely tiny

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
device obviously looks absolutely tiny
in<00:00:45.000> comparison<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> s5<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.980> screen<00:00:47.219> size

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
in comparison to the s5 the screen size

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.240 
in comparison to the s5 the screen size
is<00:00:47.460> only<00:00:47.730> 4<00:00:48.120> inches<00:00:48.440> but<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.070> terms

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
is only 4 inches but actually in terms

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
is only 4 inches but actually in terms
of<00:00:50.430> thickness<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:51.239> interesting<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of thickness it's pretty interesting the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.100 
of thickness it's pretty interesting the
iPhone<00:00:52.680> 5<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.920> thinner<00:00:53.550> than<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> s5<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.690> point

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
iPhone 5 is thinner than the s5 at point

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.979 
iPhone 5 is thinner than the s5 at point
three<00:00:55.199> zero<00:00:55.530> inches<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.750> pretty

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
three zero inches so that's pretty

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.080 
three zero inches so that's pretty
interesting<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.500> note<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.320> these<00:01:05.159> devices<00:01:05.400> are

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
interesting to note so these devices are

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
interesting to note so these devices are
arranged<00:01:06.960> largest<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> smallest<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
arranged largest to smallest and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
arranged largest to smallest and
hopefully<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> comparison<00:01:09.479> will<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.290> give

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
hopefully this comparison will just give

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.840 
hopefully this comparison will just give
you<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:11.040> understanding<00:01:11.670> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you a bit of a better understanding of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.060 
you a bit of a better understanding of
how<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> physical<00:01:12.780> size<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> s5<00:01:13.590> matches

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
how the physical size of the s5 matches

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
how the physical size of the s5 matches
up<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.340> some<00:01:14.520> other<00:01:14.610> heavy<00:01:14.880> hitters<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
up with some other heavy hitters on the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.010 
up with some other heavy hitters on the
ting<00:01:15.810> lineup<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.270> device<00:01:21.540> boots<00:01:21.810> up

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
ting lineup so as the device boots up

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
ting lineup so as the device boots up
you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.590> clearly<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.460> powered<00:01:23.850> by

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you can clearly see that it's powered by

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780 
you can clearly see that it's powered by
Android<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.950> think<00:01:25.950> we're<00:01:26.070> first<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.640> gonna

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
Android I think we're first just gonna

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.710 
Android I think we're first just gonna
take<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.240> some<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> physical

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
take a look at some of the physical

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.770 
take a look at some of the physical
aspects<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> device<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.270> bottom<00:01:30.479> of

will<00:03:22.080> take<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.410> off<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.830> now<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:24.080> know<00:03:25.080> a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
will take it off for you now I know a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.870 
will take it off for you now I know a
lot<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.410> people<00:03:25.680> actually<00:03:25.800> do<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.700> like

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
lot of people actually do like that like

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.970 
lot of people actually do like that like
this<00:03:27.060> because<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> plastic<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:28.050> can't<00:03:28.800> easily

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
this because a plastic back can't easily

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.010 
this because a plastic back can't easily
smash<00:03:29.460> but<00:03:30.030> at<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.180> same<00:03:30.360> time<00:03:30.540> obviously<00:03:30.720> it

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
smash but at the same time obviously it

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.740 
smash but at the same time obviously it
makes<00:03:31.170> your<00:03:31.260> device<00:03:31.530> maybe<00:03:31.740> feel<00:03:32.130> or<00:03:32.340> look<00:03:33.060> a

makes your device maybe feel or look a

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.690 
makes your device maybe feel or look a
little<00:03:33.870> cheaper<00:03:34.350> than<00:03:34.470> say<00:03:34.680> an<00:03:34.800> HTC<00:03:35.280> One<00:03:35.520> or

that's<00:03:50.670> about<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.170> like<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.320> said<00:03:52.380> before<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that's about it like I said before you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.490 
that's about it like I said before you
just<00:03:53.100> need<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> make<00:03:53.550> sure<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.000> fully<00:03:54.780> close

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
just need to make sure to fully close

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.040 
just need to make sure to fully close
the<00:03:55.890> back<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.610> device<00:03:56.760> by<00:03:57.150> clamping<00:03:57.780> all

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
the back of the device by clamping all

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.960 
the back of the device by clamping all
the<00:03:58.140> clips<00:03:58.380> down<00:03:58.590> or<00:03:59.160> else<00:03:59.310> your<00:03:59.490> device<00:03:59.730> will

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
the clips down or else your device will

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.110 
the clips down or else your device will
not<00:04:00.180> be<00:04:00.360> waterproof<00:04:01.460> and<00:04:02.460> I<00:04:02.610> really<00:04:02.820> think<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
not be waterproof and I really think the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.660 
not be waterproof and I really think the
overall<00:04:03.390> design
