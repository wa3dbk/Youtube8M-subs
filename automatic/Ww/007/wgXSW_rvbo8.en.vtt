 collaboration with my friend silver android 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.320

 I also invite you to visit my video 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.900

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.000
 interesting exposed modules and much more 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.510
 without so much roll let's start and 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.519
 we started the first application that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.350
 Our sample is called imagine that it is a 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.720
 manager with material design for 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.330
 instagram where we will be able to visualize 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.940
 all in a more elegant way both the 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.760
 chronology like when uploading a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.760
 image or video and as well as our profile 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.550
 in addition to the other options that this 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.390
 manager accompanies them as I like them 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 that we have given 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.580
 trends 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.470
 and do not forget this important section 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.560
 about you and it is that if we have 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.840
 the gps activated and we're going to this 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.270
 option we appear the most people 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.399
 close to you that are in 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.470
 instagram without a doubt an incredible 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.250
 application that should not be missing in our 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.590
 Android phone 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.690
 we went to the second application and it 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 it's about my android which is a 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.610
 application that gives us information 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.310
 Useful about our device as 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.690
 which we are going to see next 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.820
 we started and for example we can see 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.460
 how many applications in total do we have 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 both the user's applications as 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 the system 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 On the other hand visualize all the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.010
 exact memory that we still have a 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 complete and detailed history of all 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.930
 the calls that are divided into 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 unknown and known information 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.410
 of our camera since occasions are 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.229
 we get to forget and here we can 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.420
 remember her as they watch my motorcycle there 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.510
 has the rear camera of 13 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.480
 megapixels and a front 2.1 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.900
 megapixels also informs us how many 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.190
 Exact photographs are left 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.290
 we continue and now it provides us 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 exactly what internet are we 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.050
 connected either a wifi network or data 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.690
 We can see the exact size of our 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.520
 mobile as well as its screen density 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.040
 among others 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520
 your memory ryan exact the version of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.430
 android 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.920
 that we currently have and the manufacturer 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.840
 and model of our phone no doubt 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.090
 an excellent application that gives us 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.820
 necessary information in case we have been 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.920
 forgotten something from our device without 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.560
 doubt the application should not be lacking in 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.050
 our device with android 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.209
 we went to the third application and it 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.580
 try to tape that is an application that 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.340
 gives us some wallpapers in hd 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.290
 It's super elegant if we slide our 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.020
 finger up is changing the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.580
 wallpapers has varied and also with 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.580
 style material design 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.130
 once chosen the one that we 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.290
 we want to just click on the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.970
 popcorn and quickly adjusts to 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.970
 our screen and apply it 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.090
 we can also save our 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.310
 wallpaper or share it we can also 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.380
 add a nice option where 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.630
 we can enable automatic change 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.910
 of our funds and here in options 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.790
 we put the right interval so that 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.460
 it is changed from 15 minutes to 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.140
 weekly undoubtedly an excellent 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.450
 application that should not be missing in 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.430
 our device with android and what 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.410
 best of all, we do not need 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.330
 internet so that they leave 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.860
 changing depending on the time that 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.860
 we have put 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.749
 we continue and now it's turn 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.639
 manager hiring that is an excellent 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:09.159
 application that will help us save 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.680
 battery when we do not use our 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.019
 device with android is to say when 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.549
 our screen goes off we can put 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.370
 in wintering our processor 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.070
 our adjustments and even some 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.440
 applications below each thing we 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.990
 explains why we must winter it and 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.349
 how it works for example if we activate 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.460
 the winterization of our cpu 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.979
 automatically the cpu is put to the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.199
 lowest possible frequency while the 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.919
 screen is turned off this option 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.990
 Ensures tremendous battery saving 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.449
 we go to the settings and we can choose 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.610
 which ones do we want to be deactivated when 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.410
 our screen is off and you 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.419
 activate when our screen returns to 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.580
 be turned on like this if 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.949
 we choose all of us will be able to save more 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.259
 battery than normal because when you're 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.479
 off the screen the wintering to 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.849
 that does not consume more battery than normal 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.099
 the last option corresponds to the 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.470
 hibernation of applications where 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.910
 we can choose which applications do not 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.740
 we want them to be followed 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.150
 both when our screen is 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.130
 found off 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.470
 in this way they guarantee savings of 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.870
 incredible battery I invite you to the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.300
 try and for yourselves take out your 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.980
 own personal conclusions I have 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.980
 I felt a slight battery saving 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.949
 the latest application in her husband model 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.259
 called book with which he will help us 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.599
 to give a nice animation to our 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.849
 text messages or messages 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.699
 whatsapp in the status bar as what 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.349
 are watching right now that is going 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.479
 to occur this animation when we 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.550
 those messages arrive and well no 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.099
 we have to configure practically 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.770
 nothing you just have to click here 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.860
 where it says apli and restart our 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.599
 device so that this arises effect 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.610
 I remind you that in 4 to the plus not 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.550
 the animation works only in the 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.710
 original whatsapp no doubt a very module 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.520
 simple but super elegant for 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.520
 our device 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.780
 and good guys this has been everything and
