00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.910
 I will show you how and make out a page in 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.849
 style of sadness from the puzzle and so 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.400
 let's start for this we need 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.320
 empty popcorn cup which 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.920
 I bought before viewing session 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 we have a puzzle here sadness 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.699
 squeamishness anger and fear today i 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.400
 I will remember the page with my love 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.869
 characters sadness 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.690
 also we will need stationery 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.290
 for example pencils markers 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.680
 watercolor paints 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.970
 and now we have this way 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:47.670
 print our cup from under the root 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:49.620
 so that it becomes such a plate 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.080
 we got such plates and now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.080
 we have to cut into such petals 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.550
 in the end we have such 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.830
 petals with characters from the puzzle 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.420
 and see who we have we have 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.159
 perez mane sadness 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.000
 anger and fear eat my page I will 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.140
 with sadness and by the way here's every petal 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.650
 it perfectly fits the format page 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.540
 a little more again i will stick on 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.680
 right sadness page 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.600
 but first I make a page so 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.870
 scraps so i don't want that much 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.659
 page for bark beat so 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.140
 small watercolor splashes 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.140
 blue 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.830
 then we got this page 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.060
 with blots 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.010
 from watercolor and it is made under linking 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.130
 sorrow there are various shades of blue 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.130
 and blue and now we cut out the sadness 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.630
 so we stuck our sadness on the right 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.520
 part of the turn for clearance left 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.620
 page we need stickers 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.830
 bookmarks and papers on which here 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.270
 written sad things first sadness 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.270
 This is when my best friend is sick 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.270
 Nastya 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.290
 2 sadness is when the owner is the dog and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.690
 he treats her roughly for example there 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.050
 or goes with it pulls the leash and so 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.050
 Further 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.799
 the next sadness is when you walk along 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.469
 street without an umbrella so going for a walk and 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.170
 It begins to rain but 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:31.500
 only i take an umbrella no point 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.170
 not one drop in the sky at all 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.980
 the rain and the last sadness is that in 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.590
 24 hours a day 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.290
 now we take the inscription sadness which 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.790
 we cut it off before and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.360
 paste as heading 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:04:04.129
 we aim with the left and we also cut out all 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:04:06.620
 our sorrows and further we are false all our 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:09.560
 sadness on screaming arrange so that 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.660
 we liked it all it may take 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.239
 some time because such 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.340
 the archer will remain forever needed already 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.489
 finally decided who the page will be 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.489
 to look like 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.580
 in the book for special occasions there is 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.320

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.720
 use as they are in blue 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.000
 purple gamut that is very happy fit 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.250
 after we all decided with 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.310
 arrangement we can all stick and 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.490
 by the way leave more room for 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.450
 labels between records for example here I am 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.990

 fill in the form with labels 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.310

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.700
