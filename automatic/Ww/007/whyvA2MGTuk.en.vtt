 video I tell you if seeing water is already 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.490
 beneficial to our health imagine 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.320
 if the ones we drink is alkaline water, 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.420
 alkaline water is ten times more 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.119
 beneficial to our body that 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.800
 the conventional water and of course we 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.259

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.810
 video more to get a body 10 a lot 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.720

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.180
 muscle and skin of higher quality care 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.530
 to which I am going to show you next 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.530
 look good attentive 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 Y 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.230
 you have seen that it is simple what 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.620
 I just did and how great what I just 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.380
 of converting the water that I have poured into 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.220
 That is neutral water water with a 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:10.240
 ph 7 is water that is neither acid nor 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.230
 alkaline and I've turned it into ph 9 in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.690
 alkaline water pH measures acidity and 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.440
 alkalinity of a substance in a 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.470
 scale from 0 to 14 being 7 and 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.630
 values higher than 7 alkaline and 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.420
 Both its benefits are much greater 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.670
 to achieve our goals and 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 reach a body 10 more quickly and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.979
 now I'm going to show you the benefits 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.990
 most important to drink alkaline water 1 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.640
 neutralizes the over acidity in our 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.280
 blood thus getting an increase 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.990
 incredible energy 2 helps us 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.270
 oxygenate our flow much better 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.220
 blood manages to run faster by 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 all our capillaries veins and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.940
 arteries 3 contains and releases minerals 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.860
 as important as calcium the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.390
 magnesium or iron 4 favors 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 notably to digestion and 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 assimilation of our food is a 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.600
 macro 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.090
 nutrients as well as supplements 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.890
 nutritional 5 helps eliminate fat 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.890
 in a lasting way and favors the increase 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.780
 of muscle mass avoids the yoyÃ³ effect 6 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.729
 Its antioxidant power is enormous, finishing 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.489
 with free radicals that are harmful 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.780
 and favor aging 7 clean and

 blood pressure easier impossible 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.660
 transform the water and a ph 7 to a ph 9 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.090
 you have to transform it thanks 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.060
 to the materials with which it is made 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.310
