 ok guys in this new video today 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.880
 We will learn how to freeze our PC 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.039
 to see just in case we have programs 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.550
 installed we have folders documents 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.960
 saved or something so at the moment that 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.420
 you see that another person is using it 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.210
 and can install programs or I give you 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.790
 sitting or adding files or deletes 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.040
 you simply take your pc and restart it 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.949
 After restarting you complained it will 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.589
 like when the moment you freeze it 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.420
 will stay with your programs and folders 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.510
 ok now if you comment 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.190
 and I'll leave you on my website in the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.190
 applications section 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.620
 here my website ronald tutor to this 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.600
 dot dot cute I will leave you in the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.470
 applications section that's what it is 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.229
 this program program is called fritz 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.299
 version 7 of fritz version 7 here what 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.149
 we download normally has a 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.920
 typical 4 megabyte weight once 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.310
 we have downloaded we search in our 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.490
 downloads folder here downloads but 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.780
 We have observed what this application is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 we move it to the desktop because it would be 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 easier 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.340
 ok when we have it, we open it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 let's double-click 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 and we execute what is here can 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.850
 that a computer detects a virus but not 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.560
 reassure yourself that it is not a virus because 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.560

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.640
 here you can see that we have been 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.930
 created a folder we open it here in 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.750
 this folder found four 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.289

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.119

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.670
 an important note and the serial that 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.530

 ok guys since you are in the process of 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.169
 start earlier when a moment at 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.020
 that it restarts because there is not a 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.900
 window of the fritz to this window will 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.300

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.860
 waiting time but by pressing 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.370

 and then it will open what are the 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.449
 options of this program 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.430
 ok here if we want to place the 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.199
 password so if we want no I will 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.490
 I recommend that you put it in this 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.940
 case I will put a password 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.759

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.880
 frozen if they want you to surrender with 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.470
 he affects are several options of this 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.930
 program once we give in ok 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.229
 ok here we can see that here 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.360
 we get a crystal ball that you can 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.090
 put it right that the left does not 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.910

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.229
 enter the options as we press 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.030
 the next combination of gray to 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.960
 chip control 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.400

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.690
 We put 1 2 3 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.949
 other 5 people and then we can observe 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.190
 that can enter again at 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:39.280
 ok options now I will make a brief 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.690
 example create a new folder 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.840
 another folder here and again they are going to 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.540
 place the document here to pass 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.760
 this program here and the trash 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.010
 ok here we see that because it is ordered 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.780
 totally the desk and we're going to put 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.790

 we do this we give in the beginning and 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:13.539
