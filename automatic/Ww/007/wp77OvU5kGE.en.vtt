of digging I'm trying to find these the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.429 
of digging I'm trying to find these the
Neo<00:00:16.410> Geo<00:00:16.650> BIOS<00:00:17.070> that's<00:00:17.310> needed<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> play<00:00:17.940> roms

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
Neo Geo BIOS that's needed to play roms

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.840 
Neo Geo BIOS that's needed to play roms
basically<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> BIOS<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.220> information

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
basically a BIOS is like information

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269 
basically a BIOS is like information
that<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.359> ROM<00:00:21.630> uses<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> emulator<00:00:22.710> uses

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
that the ROM uses and the emulator uses

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.099 
that the ROM uses and the emulator uses
to<00:00:23.430> connect<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> each<00:00:24.000> other<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.900> you're

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
to connect to each other now you're

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
to connect to each other now you're
gonna<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> need<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.160> order<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.580> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
gonna have to need this in order for it

for you guys a Metal Slug the first one
and<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.030> guys<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> go<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and you guys will have to go and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.330 
and you guys will have to go and
download<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> other<00:00:34.440> metal<00:00:34.770> slugs<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.250> are

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
download the other metal slugs they are

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.060 
download the other metal slugs they are
bigger<00:00:35.579> files<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.300> does<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> longer<00:00:36.989> time

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
bigger files it does take a longer time

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.770 
bigger files it does take a longer time
the<00:00:38.070> higher<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.489> go<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> middle<00:00:39.390> slugs

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the higher you go up on the middle slugs

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.650 
the higher you go up on the middle slugs
like<00:00:40.110> 2<00:00:40.440> 3<00:00:40.710> 4<00:00:40.980> 5<00:00:41.250> X<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.300> gets<00:00:42.450> bigger

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
like 2 3 4 5 X the more you gets bigger

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.840 
like 2 3 4 5 X the more you gets bigger
I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.780> Metal<00:00:43.530> Slug<00:00:43.620> X<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.430> 70

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I think Metal Slug X is about 70

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549 
I think Metal Slug X is about 70
megabytes<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.050> said<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.320> gonna<00:00:46.410> have

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
megabytes like I said you're gonna have

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
megabytes like I said you're gonna have
to<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.739> find<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.070> those<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> yourself<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.239> will

when<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.050> download<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.770> NeoGeo<00:00:59.370> roms<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
when you download the NeoGeo roms that

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
when you download the NeoGeo roms that
will<00:01:00.090> come<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> zip<00:01:00.690> file<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.260> unless

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
will come in a zip file do not unless

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.830 
will come in a zip file do not unless
the<00:01:02.520> way<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> emulator<00:01:03.149> works<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> that's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the way the emulator works and that's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.119 
the way the emulator works and that's
the<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> reads<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.830> keep<00:01:05.010> them

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the way it reads them so keep them

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789 
the way it reads them so keep them
zipped<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.540> copy<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:06.960> over<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
zipped up and just copy them over so

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
zipped up and just copy them over so
we're<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.640> ahead<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.850> grab<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:09.270> flash

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we're gonna go ahead and grab our flash

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
we're gonna go ahead and grab our flash
there<00:01:09.930> we're<00:01:10.049> gonna<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.439> connect<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> and

we're gonna go ahead and copy the FBA

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.350 
we're gonna go ahead and copy the FBA
next<00:01:13.080> 3.55<00:01:14.070> emulator<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:14.939> ahead<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.180> grab
