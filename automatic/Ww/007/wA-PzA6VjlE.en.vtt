00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.609 
seven minute pace you're obviously going
to<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.219> your<00:01:45.850> body's<00:01:46.329> calorie<00:01:46.810> burn<00:01:47.049> in<00:01:47.259> that

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
to up your body's calorie burn in that

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.109 
to up your body's calorie burn in that
amount<00:01:47.859> of<00:01:47.979> time<00:01:48.039> running<00:01:48.579> is<00:01:48.789> also

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
amount of time running is also

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.849 
amount of time running is also
considered<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.630> catabolic<00:01:50.109> work<00:01:50.469> out<00:01:50.649> which<00:01:50.829> is

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
considered a catabolic work out which is

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.770 
considered a catabolic work out which is
the<00:01:50.979> breakdown<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.490> fat<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.090> energy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
the breakdown of fat and energy

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.599 
the breakdown of fat and energy
molecules<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:53.590> if<00:01:53.979> you've<00:01:54.159> got<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.369> lot<00:01:54.430> of

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
molecules so if you've got a lot of

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.730 
molecules so if you've got a lot of
stored<00:01:54.939> up<00:01:55.060> energy<00:01:55.180> from<00:01:55.659> carbohydrates<00:01:55.869> fats

and protein running and jogging is a

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.660 
and protein running and jogging is a

is swimming I like this one because it's

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.640 
is swimming I like this one because it's
so<00:02:26.950> hard<00:02:27.250> for<00:02:27.310> me<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.959> burn<00:02:29.170> so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
so hard for me to do and you burn so

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.530 
so hard for me to do and you burn so
many<00:02:29.680> calories<00:02:30.160> while<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:30.940> doing<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.360> just

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
think about all those times you go to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.800 
think about all those times you go to
the<00:02:33.400> pool<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.970> during<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.270> summer<00:02:34.510> when<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the pool and during the summer when you

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.420 
the pool and during the summer when you
were<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> kid<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.440> then<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:36.010> get<00:02:36.220> home<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
were a kid and then you get home and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.130 
were a kid and then you get home and
you'd<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.850> super<00:02:37.300> dog<00:02:37.450> tired<00:02:37.810> or<00:02:38.020> your

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
you'd be super dog tired or your

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.870 
you'd be super dog tired or your
baseball<00:02:38.530> coach<00:02:38.709> would<00:02:38.950> be<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.700> got<00:02:39.850> a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
baseball coach would be like we got a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.970 
baseball coach would be like we got a
game<00:02:40.180> tomorrow<00:02:40.390> no<00:02:40.810> swim<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.290> well<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.830> reason

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
game tomorrow no swim it well the reason

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.640 
game tomorrow no swim it well the reason
is<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:42.520> it's<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.110> exhausting<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
is because it's so exhausting it's a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.370 
is because it's so exhausting it's a
full<00:02:44.980> body<00:02:45.250> workout<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.970> incorporates

full body workout that incorporates

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.870 
full body workout that incorporates
every<00:02:47.380> single<00:02:47.709> one<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.860> your<00:02:48.100> extremities<00:02:48.400> and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.990 
all of your limbs and your body parts
and<00:02:50.500> your<00:02:50.590> muscles<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:51.220> only<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.610> propel

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
and your muscles not only to propel

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.820 
and your muscles not only to propel
yourself<00:02:52.120> forward<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.050> water<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.440> keep

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
yourself forward in the water to keep

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.000 
yourself forward in the water to keep
yourself<00:02:54.070> buoyant<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:56.260> other<00:02:56.440> benefits

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
yourself buoyant so the other benefits

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.010 
yourself buoyant so the other benefits
of<00:02:57.250> swimming<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.270> super<00:02:58.810> low

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
of swimming is that it's super low

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.410 
of swimming is that it's super low
impact<00:02:59.650> there's<00:03:00.070> nearly<00:03:00.250> no<00:03:00.550> impact<00:03:01.000> they

impact there's nearly no impact they

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.410 
impact there's nearly no impact they

sprinting<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.299> one<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.600> absolute

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
sprinting is one of the absolute

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.320 
sprinting is one of the absolute
toughest<00:03:23.739> things<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.310> do<00:03:24.489> spring<00:03:25.299> is

toughest things you can do spring is

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.470 
toughest things you can do spring is
considered<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.739> know<00:03:26.860> running<00:03:27.250> or<00:03:27.580> full<00:03:28.180> body

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
considered you know running or full body

considered you know running or full body
burn<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:29.470> X<00:03:29.799> amount<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.220> time<00:03:30.430> usually<00:03:30.730> it's

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
burn for X amount of time usually it's

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.080 
burn for X amount of time usually it's
between<00:03:31.769> 10-2<00:03:32.769> at<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> most<00:03:33.340> about<00:03:33.580> 60

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
between 10-2 at the most about 60

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.699 
between 10-2 at the most about 60
seconds<00:03:34.540> because<00:03:34.930> that's<00:03:35.140> about<00:03:35.410> all<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
seconds because that's about all that

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.410 
seconds because that's about all that
the<00:03:35.860> human<00:03:36.190> body<00:03:36.370> can<00:03:36.640> handle<00:03:36.790> before<00:03:37.060> it's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
the human body can handle before it's

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.000 
the human body can handle before it's
exhausting<00:03:37.930> has<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.230> go<00:03:38.320> into<00:03:38.440> recovery<00:03:38.620> mode

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
exhausting has to go into recovery mode

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.280 
exhausting has to go into recovery mode
so<00:03:39.370> with<00:03:39.549> sprinting<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.209> creates<00:03:40.540> hypertrophy

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
so with sprinting it creates hypertrophy

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.710 
so with sprinting it creates hypertrophy
and<00:03:41.320> what<00:03:41.560> hypertrophy<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.640> growth<00:03:43.450> and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and what hypertrophy is is growth and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.740 
and what hypertrophy is is growth and
increased<00:03:44.620> volume<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.280> cells<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.970> organs

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
increased volume of cells and organs

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750 
increased volume of cells and organs
over<00:03:47.110> time<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.890> essentially<00:03:48.400> it's<00:03:48.549> going<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
over time so essentially it's going to

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
over time so essentially it's going to
build<00:03:49.060> all<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.329> your<00:03:49.720> muscles<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.290> going<00:03:50.470> to
