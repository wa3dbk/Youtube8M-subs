00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.340
 I speak of my life, things that I observe on the floor 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.860
 Ok, Keurspi "99" on the plated chain 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.760
 Hide the small strikes because my rap is planted 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.340
 Let others warn you, we're not here to joke 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 Zig-zag on the Fanfo beat (Simple King) 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.240
 Here it works or dies as Fanto said 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.760
 So I sprint to each verse, like a Maurice Green 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.320
 The team is complete and would fill Queens 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.020
 One love to those who support me, my team and my friends 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.360
 Those who, upward, shoot me and carry me 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.180
 Of their esteem endow me, my origins of the Boot 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.860
 I carry in me, and like a bull, I kick the doors 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.320
 I burn, I do not have only twelve works like Hercules 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120
 If the weather was ours we would be powerful like Hypercut 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.580
 So many images in my phases, but few that strike 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.580
 These nazes have nothing else to say except that it's super cute 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.860
 Like Black Supa Dupa (Black Kent), I have more time 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.600
 In the bins, I'm not fooled by this stuff that stinks so much 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.360
 The talent is no longer large against wheat, so I taf in scred, crazy mess like Dre 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.480
 Expected as Detox and Rahzel at the beatbox, call me Hurricane because I'm embarrassed when the beat j'boxe 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.800
 Malcolm was black and I'm a babtou, so those I'm suspicious of, it's not blacks but babtous 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 I even slap, report my blues 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.100
 Do not worry about everyone, my bow I have a lot of twelve 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.600
 In the game a lot of dung, need a lot of blouses 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 It's only when I quote in my 16 that you have a lot of buzz 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.220
 Keurs is the message of a Pac and the slamming of a BIggie 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.760
 But who said rap was Bling-Bling and baggys? 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.420
 It's just about to start, and everyone wants to take my place like at Nagui 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.220
 Not gay are the courses of our lives so we paddle 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.540
 Seems that whores in your clips is progress 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.980
 I agree, never my principles I will not barter 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.140
 Even if sometimes I crack like ships, I'll bite you 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.820
 Soon 10 pins that I scratch the leaves, and crame the beat so that the kick knows the mourning 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.620
 Hits hits, and flush them quickly, rap wacks, cut their cliques 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.100
 No crack, my madness the mic, m'affament the crowd and the eyes which are pointing 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.860
 Like Eminem, the man hovers and jumps from the Grand Canyon 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240
 On a hand, falls back, maintains its balance like Danone 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.000
 The disciples are saying street, but too many biz in the district 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.900
 The diss pros and the p'tits s'fritent while baffes I distribute 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.380
 I do not expect your agreement, hanged mic to death because unbreakable is my rope 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.860
 My touch I bring and it opens doors, I read in your thoughts as Akinator 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.800
 Hip Hop my green line, avoid your nonsense, otherwise I send 20 miles leagues under the sea to Jules Verne 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.100
 Emotional and conscious, I do not advocate nonsense, I violate the instru and even if it consents 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.320
 See how it goes, you know that there will be no chorus, not even in the end, I'm so hungry 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.900
 Keurs comes out the square of aces, always square on the bass, if I speak of something it is that I know as Abass 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.420
 Dude I do not count my bars, and if the rap flowers, I just plant my sting 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.020
 Many rappers, but few who own art 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.600
 For mc's dust I arrive by way of O'Cedar 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.780
 Big up Fanto, Black Kent and Simon, Simple, Bizzy, Lawkick and Sagagon 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.500
 Alino Pepe, my man Daartist, Marshal, Doctor X, 99 my clique 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.500
 I'm conscious even in my egotrips, some would like to smoke while even their butts freak 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.620
 Here is the white that is said to be taken for a black, but even the blacks turn white since 99 in the bins 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.820
 The red ink flows and opens a new chapter, in the barnyard hens coo and brood a new song of pitres 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.300
 Tell the hicks to let go of the bunch, while they waste their time to jealous me, I rap!
