you're<00:01:54.310> cute<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.970> think<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.420> came<00:01:55.600> from<00:01:55.660> when<00:01:56.440> I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
you're cute I think it came from when I

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.469 
you're cute I think it came from when I
played<00:01:56.800> against<00:01:57.040> reckless<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.430> few<00:01:57.759> times<00:01:58.060> he

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
played against reckless a few times he

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.480 
played against reckless a few times he
saw<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.990> I'm<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.710> pretty<00:01:59.860> good<00:02:00.009> ad<00:02:00.130> carry<00:02:00.399> and

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
saw that I'm a pretty good ad carry and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.880 
saw that I'm a pretty good ad carry and
I<00:02:00.700> think<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.060> he<00:02:01.330> told<00:02:01.539> others<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.200> then<00:02:02.860> I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
I think that he told others and then I

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.560 
I think that he told others and then I
started<00:02:03.430> playing<00:02:03.580> with<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:03.910> much<00:02:04.030> doing<00:02:04.270> with

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
started playing with so much doing with

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.850 
started playing with so much doing with
him<00:02:04.690> that<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.020> did<00:02:05.200> some<00:02:05.320> games<00:02:05.470> with<00:02:05.680> yellow

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860

him that I did some games with yellow
star<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:07.360> think<00:02:07.570> they<00:02:07.660> were<00:02:07.780> convinced

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140
