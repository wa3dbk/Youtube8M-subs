00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
they'll be hard to know I use the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.900 
they'll be hard to know I use the
another<00:02:34.560> pot<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.220> I'm<00:02:35.310> gonna<00:02:35.489> start<00:02:35.700> using

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
another pot but I'm gonna start using

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.069 
another pot but I'm gonna start using
this<00:02:36.150> one<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:37.560> make<00:02:37.709> things<00:02:37.950> easier<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.090> well

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
this one to make things easier so well

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.259 
this one to make things easier so well
let<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.260> break<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.430> I'll<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.819> back<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.030> just

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
let that break and I'll be back in just

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:51.650 
let that break and I'll be back in just
a<00:02:42.630> few<00:02:43.140> minutes<00:02:43.470> okay<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.440> back<00:02:50.220> okay<00:02:50.819> so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
a few minutes okay we are back okay so

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.199 
a few minutes okay we are back okay so
this<00:02:51.780> has<00:02:51.959> been<00:02:52.049> boiling<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.950> while<00:02:53.250> we're

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
this has been boiling for a while we're

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.110 
this has been boiling for a while we're
gonna<00:02:54.299> turn<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.599> off<00:02:55.280> give<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.579> stir<00:02:56.940> no

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
gonna turn it off give it a stir no

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.629 
gonna turn it off give it a stir no
think<00:02:59.690> now<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:01.769> might<00:03:01.920> ask<00:03:01.950> about<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
think now you might ask about the

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.430 
think now you might ask about the
grounds<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.810> normally<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.380> a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
grounds in there so I normally have a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.620 
grounds in there so I normally have a
smaller<00:03:04.859> I've<00:03:05.190> said<00:03:05.639> but<00:03:06.000> I'll<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.329> use<00:03:06.480> this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
smaller I've said but I'll just use this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.020 
smaller I've said but I'll just use this
one<00:03:06.690> did<00:03:06.959> any<00:03:07.109> case<00:03:07.380> I'm<00:03:08.280> not<00:03:08.489> digging<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.000> my

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
one did any case I'm not digging out my

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.090 
one did any case I'm not digging out my
other<00:03:09.239> one<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.910> I'll<00:03:12.120> just<00:03:12.329> set<00:03:12.600> down<00:03:13.100> over

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
other one and I'll just set down over

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:24.470 
other one and I'll just set down over
here<00:03:14.569> let<00:03:15.569> me<00:03:15.630> move<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.989> camera<00:03:16.230> over<00:03:23.480> I'll

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
here let me move this camera over I'll

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.430 
here let me move this camera over I'll
take<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:25.639> and<00:03:26.900> pour<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.959> through<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.170> sieve

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
take this and pour it through the sieve

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.309 
take this and pour it through the sieve
into<00:03:28.650> my<00:03:28.769> cup<00:03:29.480> try<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.690> burn<00:03:30.810> myself<00:03:31.019> to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:53.420 

being<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.190> time<00:03:39.430> look<00:03:40.420> you're<00:03:40.569> really<00:03:40.659> hot

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.580 

now<00:03:54.430> as<00:03:55.330> you<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.629> see<00:03:55.690> there's<00:03:56.080> hardly<00:03:56.230> any

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
now as you can see there's hardly any

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
now as you can see there's hardly any

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
grounds in there our vanity so that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.150 
grounds in there our vanity so that
worked<00:04:00.790> out<00:04:00.970> well<00:04:01.349> but<00:04:02.349> that's<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.680> fresh<00:04:02.890> cup

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
ground or two that got through the sieve

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.500 
ground or two that got through the sieve
there<00:04:08.200> are<00:04:08.319> finer<00:04:08.739> quality<00:04:09.400> sibs<00:04:09.700> but<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.330> don't

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
there are finer quality sibs but I don't

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.870 
there are finer quality sibs but I don't
have<00:04:10.630> one<00:04:10.750> right<00:04:10.959> here<00:04:11.140> today<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:11.769> that's<00:04:12.760> the
