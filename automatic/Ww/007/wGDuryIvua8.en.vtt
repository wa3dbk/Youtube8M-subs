Hello and welcome to another episode of Bearpaw News!

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:18.785
Today I would like to show you a new and pretty awesome product. As you might already know

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:27.527
Henry Bodnik visited the last ATA Show in USA and found this little something over there.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:33.183
What is it? Well - it is a "Game Changer" or Game Changer Target System!

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:36.344
Let me show you how it looks like!

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:45.004
Pretty big - pretty well built. Let me show you some details about the target.

00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:57.584
We have these pictures on a roll with 6 motives on each vinyl roll.

00:00:57.584 --> 00:01:03.844
It is very weather resistant due to the material of what it is made from.

00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:16.545
You can change the motives when you turn these two rolls very easily!

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:23.644
And it apears the next image - what is this - let me see - a deer :-)

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:32.304
On this top part over here you can find some informations about where the animal would live

00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:38.277
and how big it is displayed. Here it would be 50% - that means if you shoot at the game changer

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:43.926
from 20 yards it would be like if you shoot a deer from 40 yards for real.

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:54.723
Please dont use blades for shooting - this target is made for field points use only!

00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:02.583
Let's take a look how the Game Changer looks from behind.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:09.038
You can see here it is made out of many different layers.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:17.373
Thats pretty cool because you can easily replace layers from the outer areas with

00:02:17.373 --> 00:02:24.337
layers from the middle - so your target will almost last forever :-)

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:34.666
There will be different rolls with different motives available.

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:43.286
For example differt types of animals, a roll with white deer but also one with games on it.

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:53.145
Or some african game over here. This would be a wild beast for example.

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:56.982
And you can easily change these different rolls. No problem there.

00:02:56.982 --> 00:03:02.164
It was designed for compound shooters which means it is made for a last!

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:10.371
But enough talking - let me show you how good the Game Changer is in real life.

00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:15.524
Henry grabed the first one of these Targets for personal testing - so let's go to Henry!

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:28.144
We arrived at Henry's place - best April weather with a bit of snow ;-)

00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:32.584
We have two professional shooters over here - Henry Bodnik and his son Tom.

00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:37.604
They will show us some shots at the Game Changer Target. Let's rock!

00:04:18.464 --> 00:04:22.406
So guys - what do you think of the Game Changer Target?

00:04:25.144 --> 00:04:28.385
I think the Game Changer Target System is pretty awesome!

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:33.704
That's why the target is here at my private archery range. I shoot on the Game Changer daily

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:37.704
and it really lasts almost forever! It really is a very good target!

00:04:37.704 --> 00:04:44.421
Nice! That were some clear words for the target - please visit us on facebook!

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:56.207
Until next time - see you soon :-) Bye!
