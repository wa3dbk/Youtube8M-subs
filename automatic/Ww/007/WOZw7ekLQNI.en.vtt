00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.800
 It is Akio Akima of Dharma Meima 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.220
 Positive grid bias 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.940
 this 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.610
 And an amplifier builder as a guitarist 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.420
 I want to check thoroughly 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.420
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.320
 This is something that already sounds like Donzuba 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.789
 Clearly different from the built- in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.789
 How to de of the loan but it is your image It is there staff is doing and do Motsuru 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.780
 I This is what el 34 of sessile without saying 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.730
 Or cation is more that let this try to 84 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.159
 What a little type of output 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.360
 There is an image that the number of harmonics is extremely increased in the non- output soul. 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.060
 First especially I I think that facing the push Chung to such distortion sound 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.060
 34 sound of say what kind of selfish 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.060
 When it comes to 8 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.090
 pa 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:32.750
 Compression parentheses or at me out very strongly made feel Yappa softening stickiness original value 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.750
 Do not you say 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.600
 hey 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 Yes yeah yeah 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.080
 pane 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.680
 It's not like my own amp but it feels good 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 This is not only changing the vacuum tube, but it can also be changed because of the cause of the prepart 's child. 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.920
 When 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.540
 On such a day, this is Southeast processing of Stone 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:29.879
 Because this is another cause of this panel of amps 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.140
 The cause is going up , but maybe it is possible to distort in the part of the nuance that is different from this 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.860
 Made 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.090
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.890
 Though it is the output transformer of the transformer 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.450
 Oh that actually 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.470
 The Tteyuu signal that has passed through the power tube to the speaker through the output transformer 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.710
 I'm not going to go 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.000
 And that's not to say that they are well connected in the war 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.170
 Like a coil, there is actually such a thing with a coil 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.600
 So that texture will be reflected in the great things will be like with a guitar 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.580
 Why mon pickup like a 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.370
 It is already a super luxury story that I can actually exchange this, but now it is American 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.520
 We not match the style 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.790
 Ha ha ha 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 this 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.380
 First tree Te impossible 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380
 DEA 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.000
 Somewhat fat 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.320
 further 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.320
 Uesa 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.320
 DEA 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:35.090
 The power of each of the bass strings comes around 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.750
 This Hey Tsu because not still thin Te America N'become boned 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.810
 Anyway, this is the kind of pad that I like 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.810
 You do 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.870
 with this 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:58.550
 I don't feel calm I feel good This bias is fun to make an amp 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:03.160
 And it's fun to pull it down there really is endless possibilities 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.160
 I think it is a great invincible item 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:13.700
 I do not care 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.700
 I'm've been thought that I do not want to say Oh'm not not say things like that
