00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.639 
she'll be four months in a couple of
days<00:00:36.140> it's<00:00:37.140> mostly<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:38.010> babies<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:39.620> have<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
days it's mostly for babies that have a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.790 
days it's mostly for babies that have a
good<00:00:40.980> head<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.820> neck<00:00:42.000> control<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:43.469> she

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
good head and neck control which she

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.369 
good head and neck control which she
does<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.510> child<00:00:45.750> reaches<00:00:46.140> four

months and they don't have good head and
neck<00:00:48.210> control<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:49.610> wouldn't<00:00:50.610> suggest<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:52.789> as

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
