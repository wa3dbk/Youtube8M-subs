00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.690 
the game on the ps4 at least does suffer
quite<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> bit<00:05:31.950> in<00:05:32.100> terms<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.520> performance

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
quite a bit in terms of performance

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.060 
quite a bit in terms of performance
which<00:05:33.510> isn't<00:05:33.720> great<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.620> core<00:05:34.830> gameplay

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
which isn't great and the core gameplay

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.670 
which isn't great and the core gameplay
with<00:05:35.490> no<00:05:35.640> enhancements<00:05:36.390> means<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.110> suffers<00:05:37.500> as

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
with no enhancements means it suffers as

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.100 
with no enhancements means it suffers as
the<00:05:38.040> end<00:05:38.220> result<00:05:38.400> feels<00:05:39.120> too<00:05:39.419> basic<00:05:39.930> and

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
the end result feels too basic and

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.860 
the end result feels too basic and
somewhat<00:05:40.680> dated<00:05:41.060> if<00:05:42.060> you<00:05:42.240> like<00:05:42.419> action

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
somewhat dated if you like action

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.450 
somewhat dated if you like action
role-playing<00:05:43.110> games<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.860> are<00:05:44.070> itching<00:05:44.220> for

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
role-playing games and are itching for

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.670 
role-playing games and are itching for
something<00:05:44.940> new<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.360> risen<00:05:45.900> three<00:05:46.169> might<00:05:46.530> be

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
something new and risen three might be

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.140 
something new and risen three might be
worth<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:47.040> look<00:05:47.220> but<00:05:47.669> if<00:05:47.790> you're<00:05:47.910> still

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
worth a look but if you're still

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.850 
worth a look but if you're still
involved<00:05:48.450> with<00:05:48.660> similar<00:05:49.080> games<00:05:49.290> that<00:05:49.770> are

in<00:05:52.050> comparison<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.980> is<00:05:53.070> likely<00:05:53.490> not<00:05:53.700> going<00:05:53.910> to
