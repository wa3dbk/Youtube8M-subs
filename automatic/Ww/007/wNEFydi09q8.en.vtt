 i get closer to france 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.689
 we are not in a very competitive market and we depend on fashions 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.019
 per cent all markets to which we are going are very changeable all 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.439
 they have very different conditions for paying cultures for their own culture 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.069

 percent 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:58.389
 many intentions arise when you are going to choose new markets many 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.119
 efforts 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:04.839
 swimming at the cultural level dam level being product because good is the

 our in which they include the market that has to accommodate 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.379
 basically when you're in the fashion or fashion sector that we do in 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.939
 know the markets 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.129
 through 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.209
 a company known for this worker with dida 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.499
 the prescient operation was quite fast and agile or of the evil will present 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.229
 social the plans we had was a very natural integration 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.739
 in what hands on board the pipe was ordering in our this goal is 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.719
 our way of working and our strategies we have knowledge 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.210
 deep markets and earth factors markets 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.140
 and the pipe what he did not cite is knowing how to propose clear strategies to reach 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.500
 to those markets efe the pipe gives us a systematic work for a hundred 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.339
 - SMEs very important because of the emigration of resources 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.399
 the wheat and the rigor that you have to have when it comes to approaching new 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.159
 countries 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.489
 percent of the GDP that has helped us from icons people from outside contributing their 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.340
 experience 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.909
 long astute and put order in the ideas and of 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.309
 the pipe will provide us with a system of work and planning 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.750
 of plans 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.090
 i in the technical part that are the financial export tools 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.800
 deep the exchange insurance coverage 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.569
 percent in his debt amounts to he pretended his death are made to 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.939
 large companies but they are totally necessary in the SME 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.960
 and you have to adapt them to use them 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.500
 The first thing is to believe in your blog in your product in your project and have hope 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.720
 the one hundred percent of the child when you arrive at the time of exporting you have to 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.920
 be aware that 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.360
 you have to undergo many internal changes at the organization level to 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.110
 address this process export with success 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.529
 Noemí the selection of markets is 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.129
 also from naturalia where we know the potential that each 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.919
 market 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.810
 We know the size of our target in our market niche 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.320
 This is the first factor where you have a series of priorities 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.610
 of priority markets before of course you approach the ones that most 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.919
 potential has 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.020
 the UN according to a second very important factor 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.629
 per cent the people you're going to work with 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.310
 percent there are markets who the philosophy of the possible 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.150
 distributors other agents adapts much more 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.430
 to the philosophy your company and what they call of wants to arrive 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.460
 p we p we give a lot of strength our product go thinking is that in markets 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.159
 Global strengths of a product 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:38.389
 is the authenticity of the original being on site and contribute to which he answered 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.139
 of course there are one is rooms that are much more at the percent level to 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.240
 practical level at the level of commercial twigs at the level of catalogs to 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.069
 level of 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.069
 p had more in web pages hundred media communication 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.930
 product not the product is ours says what we want here with our 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.729
 identity 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.800
 and then never of him or detract we have put things that we do not like 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.729
 to adapt a country 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.789
 the kit in this sense of not interfering in our work 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.840
 per cent in him in what we create in the end that is poison emotion 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.300
 ignite others open a purchase a pledge because if identified with 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.639
 the identity this brand 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.590
 in all the actions we do 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.870
 for a hundred thousand cures to the marked arise a very natural way of our 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.180
 personality of the person that we are inside the personera the brand 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.540
 in that sense then we have organized is a film festival southeast to its 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.229
 opinion they have it in europe 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.680
 irie that is totally aimed at have shown our state etc by blind 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.909
 we made many actinver latinas with musical performances 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:44.389
 collaborations with stamps was the time to design mastic when designing 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.749
 laws or the merchandising of their products 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.159
 and we do very different things for example we are working in the 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.499
 development of a chocolate oracle niang a house of de barcelona thousand a 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.999
 cyst outstripping the internet internationalize a lot and we're 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.319
 we are very similar philosophies 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.710
