00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.140

 and with you but that exceeded well and 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.750
 good in this video about hair 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.870
 fatty I have a new fund that I hope 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.760
 like it very much 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.620
 we simply change places before 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.780
 created still looking for will know coming 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.880
 for here he likes a lot new background 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.250
 going back to the subject of hair now they are 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.380
 the first ones that mentioned some 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.240
 recommendations and then I'm going to give you two 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.710
 types that are super easy that sure 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.930
 they do it with the things they get for 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.450
 their houses 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.370
 let's start with the recommendations in the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.330
 First, do not wash with water 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.890
 too hot and pulling cold 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.110
 The recommendation is to apply the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.760
 shampoo and conditioner for hair 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.980
 fat let's say specialized in this 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.290
 hair class always peeled hair 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.300
 leave the shampoo for a few more minutes 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.340
 Senator apply it from long to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.320
 down never on the countries as last 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.000
 tips I tell you to clean very well their 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.770
 combs and their singles always remains 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.989
 some gratitude for these places well 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.420
 now we go with the first and policy 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.649
 only for this type is lips or water 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.690
 alcohol vinegar of any brand 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.910
 we implement the water medium and we are going to 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.380
 press with our with the vinegar the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.170
 grandfather that or quite diluted the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.030
 vinegar and it's not going to be I do not think it's 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.250
 so strong the median has to be 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.399
 always so exact but notice that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.840
 there is always more water than vinegar that is 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.079
 the only thing necessary after the average does not 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.149
 important 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.350
 after the shampoo and conditioner 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.200
 we stretch all over our hair 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 especially of the baisas and the long 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.829
 but obviously mainly good 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 roots and what it does is wait two 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.299
 minutes to rinse the hair with 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.429
 water and ready either the day serves 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.729
 very much and I hope you serve 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.729
 chill 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.080
 I do not have to do any 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.090
 show because it's too easy 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.440
 all they have to do is after 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.450
 of washing your hair with shampoo and 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.729
 conditioner squirt water 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
 cool well by the roots that's going to 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.970
 help a lot and well we end up with 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.369
 the tips and recommendations for today 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.649

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.820
 something very strange to go somewhere else 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.580
 if this year and well surely know 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.800
 that in these days after Tuesday 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.960
 You can watch some video showing what 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.160

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.150
 for two fingers they are super good and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.010
 although you can not do it better 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.810
