00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
lots of magnetic functionality we have a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.820 
lots of magnetic functionality we have a
removable<00:00:22.289> inner<00:00:22.890> case<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:24.470> which<00:00:25.470> attaches

thing shut and again very very strong

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.299 
thing shut and again very very strong
magnets<00:00:38.989> I've<00:00:39.989> tested<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> lot<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.010> magnetic

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
magnets I've tested a lot of magnetic

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.790 
magnets I've tested a lot of magnetic
cases<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.570> these<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cases and this is these are some of the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
cases and this is these are some of the
strongest<00:00:44.370> magnets<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.879> I've<00:00:45.090> seen<00:00:45.360> which

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
strongest magnets that I've seen which

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.389 
strongest magnets that I've seen which
is<00:00:45.930> great<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
is great because if you have a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.200 
is great because if you have a
magnetically<00:00:48.180> attached<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:49.140> closed<00:00:49.620> case<00:00:50.210> you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
magnetically attached or closed case you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689 
magnetically attached or closed case you
want<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> stay<00:00:51.840> closed<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:53.100> also<00:00:53.489> has<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
want it to stay closed this also has a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.139 
want it to stay closed this also has a
stand<00:00:54.180> function<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.320> great<00:00:56.149> all

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
stand function which is really great all

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
stand function which is really great all
of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> fit<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> finish<00:00:58.199> seems<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.280> really

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
of the fit and finish seems to be really

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
of the fit and finish seems to be really
