guess you know we've got the thumb here

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:55.370 
guess you know we've got the thumb here
it's<00:00:46.180> just<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.570> C<00:00:46.780> chord<00:00:46.990> I'm<00:00:47.200> holding<00:00:47.500> here<00:00:47.680> I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:04.200 

can<00:00:56.380> hear<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:59.520> near<00:01:00.520> that<00:01:00.720> flesh<00:01:02.460> flesh<00:01:03.460> and

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
can hear that near that flesh flesh and

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.620 
can hear that near that flesh flesh and
then<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:05.500> clicking<00:01:05.890> sound

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
then that clicking sound

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.420 
then that clicking sound
well<00:01:07.630> it's<00:01:07.900> denial<00:01:08.200> visit<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.040> there's<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.310> bit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
well it's denial visit so there's a bit

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.670 
well it's denial visit so there's a bit
of<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.610> gap<00:01:09.790> between<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.300> flesh<00:01:10.480> and<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.810> nail

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
of a gap between the flesh and the nail

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.170 
of a gap between the flesh and the nail
and<00:01:11.950> then<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:15.310> nail<00:01:15.520> travels<00:01:15.909> across<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
and then the nail travels across the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.950 
and then the nail travels across the
string<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.810> little<00:01:17.230> while<00:01:17.350> before<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:18.340> plays

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
string a little while before it plays

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.750 
string a little while before it plays
now<00:01:19.960> that's<00:01:20.590> not<00:01:20.770> very<00:01:20.800> nice<00:01:21.190> it's<00:01:21.580> that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
now that's not very nice it's that

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.040 
now that's not very nice it's that
clicking<00:01:22.090> sound<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.390> want<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.600> give<00:01:22.690> it<00:01:22.780> off

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
clicking sound I want to give it off

arpeggios<00:01:31.300> again<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.870> C<00:01:32.050> chord<00:01:32.350> we<00:01:32.620> got<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
arpeggios again the C chord we got the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:44.790 
arpeggios again the C chord we got the
eye

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.680 

that<00:01:45.800> might<00:01:46.040> sound<00:01:46.220> alright<00:01:46.550> -<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.420> can

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
that might sound alright - but I can

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.210 
that might sound alright - but I can
feel<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.200> it's<00:01:48.350> uncomfortable<00:01:48.740> it's

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
feel that it's uncomfortable it's

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.060 
feel that it's uncomfortable it's
hooking<00:01:52.630> because<00:01:53.630> where<00:01:53.810> my<00:01:53.990> nail<00:01:54.380> contacts

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
hooking because where my nail contacts

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.270 
hooking because where my nail contacts
the<00:01:55.220> string<00:01:55.580> there's<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.420> little<00:01:56.750> bit<00:01:56.869> of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the string there's a little bit of

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.249 
the string there's a little bit of
gliding<00:01:58.280> it<00:01:58.369> has<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.700> do<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.180> overcome<00:01:59.509> the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
gliding it has to do to overcome the

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.510 
gliding it has to do to overcome the
resistance<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.920> mayor<00:02:01.070> before<00:02:01.280> it

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
resistance of the mayor before it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.790 
resistance of the mayor before it
actually<00:02:01.610> plucks<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.869> that's<00:02:03.530> a

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
actually plucks it so that's a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.780 
actually plucks it so that's a
time-delay<00:02:04.430> sword<00:02:05.470> then<00:02:06.470> pluck<00:02:06.800> hmm<00:02:07.490> slide

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
time-delay sword then pluck hmm slide

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.940 
time-delay sword then pluck hmm slide
then<00:02:08.060> pluck<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.720> that's<00:02:08.959> very<00:02:09.320> uncomfortable

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
then pluck and that's very uncomfortable

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.180 
then pluck and that's very uncomfortable
I<00:02:10.130> want<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.090> be<00:02:11.270> able<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:12.040> contact<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
I want to just be able to contact the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.210 
I want to just be able to contact the
flesh<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.760> bit<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.510> nail<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.989> pluck<00:02:18.220> so

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
flesh a bit of the nail and pluck so

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.400 
flesh a bit of the nail and pluck so
anyway<00:02:19.580> there<00:02:20.540> now<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.810> actual<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.320> I'm
