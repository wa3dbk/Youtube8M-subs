this<00:00:00.179> program<00:00:00.539> really<00:00:00.719> did<00:00:00.960> interest<00:00:01.350> me<00:00:01.500> it's

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
this program really did interest me it's

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.500 
this program really did interest me it's
what's<00:00:02.250> called<00:00:02.399> problem-based<00:00:02.790> learning<00:00:03.030> so

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
what's called problem-based learning so

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.050 
what's called problem-based learning so
it's<00:00:03.689> not<00:00:03.810> just<00:00:04.220> didactic<00:00:05.220> or<00:00:05.400> lecture<00:00:05.759> style

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
it's not just didactic or lecture style

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.450 
it's not just didactic or lecture style
it's<00:00:06.660> more<00:00:06.839> interactive<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.890> learn<00:00:08.250> from

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
it's more interactive and you learn from

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.919 
it's more interactive and you learn from
each<00:00:08.610> other<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.090> lot<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.240> self-directed

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
each other and a lot of self-directed

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.240 
each other and a lot of self-directed
learning<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.500> really<00:00:10.710> appealed<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.130> me

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
learning and that really appealed to me

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.129 
learning and that really appealed to me
I<00:00:11.460> did<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.820> degree<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.179> biology<00:00:12.330> first<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.019> all

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
I did a degree in biology first of all

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
I did a degree in biology first of all
and<00:00:13.500> then<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.070> went<00:00:14.250> right<00:00:14.309> into<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and then I went right into that to a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.090 
and then I went right into that to a
pharmacy<00:00:15.900> degree<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.350> then<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.710> worked<00:00:16.890> for

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
pharmacy degree and then I worked for

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 
pharmacy degree and then I worked for
about<00:00:17.279> five<00:00:17.460> years<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.820> pharmacy<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> worked<00:00:18.510> in

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
about five years in pharmacy I worked in

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.230 
about five years in pharmacy I worked in
community<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.230> hospitals<00:00:19.939> in<00:00:20.939> oncology

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
community and in hospitals in oncology

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.590 
community and in hospitals in oncology
for<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:21.900> years<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:23.359> really<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> guess

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
for about two years and really I guess

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
for about two years and really I guess
just<00:00:25.260> through<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.010> kind<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.340> it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
just through that it just kind of it's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.279 
just through that it just kind of it's
probably<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.300> actually<00:00:27.750> led<00:00:27.869> me<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.260> to

probably what actually led me to want to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.810 
probably what actually led me to want to
do<00:00:28.410> medicine<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:29.010> being<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
me the opportunity for that the program

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
me the opportunity for that the program
is<00:00:38.670> covers<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> broken<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.170> three

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
is covers it's kind of broken into three

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.490 
is covers it's kind of broken into three
pieces<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.120> try<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> teach<00:00:42.600> us<00:00:42.840> on

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pieces and so they try to teach us on

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.799 
pieces and so they try to teach us on
one<00:00:43.649> side<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.460> knowledge<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.629> think

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
one side just like knowledge so we think

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.360 
one side just like knowledge so we think
about<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.140> medicine<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.680> learning<00:00:46.950> about

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
about with medicine like learning about

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
about with medicine like learning about
all<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> different<00:00:47.730> diseases<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.690> systems<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
all the different diseases or systems of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
all the different diseases or systems of
the<00:00:49.500> body<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.610> another<00:00:50.850> purse<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.360> kind

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the body and then another purse we kind

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.569 
the body and then another purse we kind
of<00:00:51.690> focus<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> clinical<00:00:52.680> skills<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of focus on the clinical skills and you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.119 
of focus on the clinical skills and you
know<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.510> anatomical<00:00:55.020> skills<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.949> third

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
know the anatomical skills and the third

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.350 
know the anatomical skills and the third
part<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.489> try<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> teach<00:00:56.850> us<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
part they try to teach us like the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.529 
part they try to teach us like the

directly<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.219> medicine<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.879> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
directly think with medicine so it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
directly think with medicine so it's
kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> broken<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.690> three<00:01:03.930> fun<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.890> it's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
kind of broken into three fun for it's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.230 
kind of broken into three fun for it's
really<00:01:05.250> good<00:01:05.400> there's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> hands-on

experience with it like the mechanical

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
experience with it like the mechanical
skills<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.490> example<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.270> right

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.070 
right from day one one of the most
interesting<00:01:26.790> parts<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> program<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> think

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
interesting parts of the program I think

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.020 
interesting parts of the program I think
is<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> anatomy<00:01:28.860> course<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
is actually the anatomy course here it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.490 
is actually the anatomy course here it's
just<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> way<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.810> taught<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> us<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.439> very

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
just the way it's taught to us it's very

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
just the way it's taught to us it's very
interactive<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.479> it's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
interactive and it's you know like it's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.210 
interactive and it's you know like it's
not<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.110> they're<00:01:34.380> three<00:01:34.590> hour<00:01:34.740> lecture<00:01:34.890> read

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
not like they're three hour lecture read

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
not like they're three hour lecture read
it's<00:01:35.369> gonna<00:01:35.520> memorize<00:01:35.700> part<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.630> really

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's gonna memorize part see it's really

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's gonna memorize part see it's really
clinically<00:01:37.170> based<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
clinically based so it's not just

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.249 
clinically based so it's not just
remember<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.909> bone<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
remember that bone it's more like you

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
remember that bone it's more like you
know<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> learned<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> example<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
know you learned in the example of you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.490 
know you learned in the example of you
know<00:01:42.150> someone<00:01:42.479> fractures<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.049> bone<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
know someone fractures that bone and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
know someone fractures that bone and
it's<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.460> describe<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.090> just

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's just I don't describe it it's just

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
it's just I don't describe it it's just
it's<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.509> practical<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.619> applied

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it's more practical the way it's applied

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.280 
it's more practical the way it's applied
like<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.579> learn<00:01:48.119> more<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> find<00:01:48.960> then

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like you learn more that way I find then

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.899 
like you learn more that way I find then
just<00:01:49.439> trying<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> memorize<00:01:49.740> everything<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.490> big

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
just trying to memorize everything a big

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.370 
just trying to memorize everything a big
advantage<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.259> room

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
advantage here is that like in this room

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
advantage here is that like in this room
here<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.640> our<00:01:53.820> work<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.090> small

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
here we do a lot of our work in small

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
here we do a lot of our work in small
groups<00:01:54.630> where<00:01:55.290> we're<00:01:55.439> presented<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> case

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
groups where we're presented a case

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.959 
groups where we're presented a case
where<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.579> what's<00:01:56.729> wrong<00:01:56.909> with

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
where we don't know what's wrong with

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.280 
where we don't know what's wrong with
the<00:01:57.060> patient<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.869> don't<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.110> much

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the patient and we don't know much

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
the patient and we don't know much
ourselves<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> got<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> you<00:02:00.180> know

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
ourselves and you kind of got a you know

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
ourselves and you kind of got a you know
you<00:02:00.390> got<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.020> could<00:02:01.229> possibly<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you got to think what could possibly and

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
you got to think what could possibly and
you<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.460> learn<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.880> process<00:02:03.079> how

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you kind of learn from that process how

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.090 
you kind of learn from that process how
you<00:02:04.140> figure<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.469> what's<00:02:04.649> wrong<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:04.950> them

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you figure out what's wrong with them

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.410 
you figure out what's wrong with them
and<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> know<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> real-world<00:02:05.880> someone's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and you know the real-world someone's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
and you know the real-world someone's
not<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> show<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.259> office<00:02:07.439> with

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
not going to show up in your office with

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
not going to show up in your office with
you<00:02:08.099> know<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.910> disease<00:02:09.149> written<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.569> their

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you know the disease written on their

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.150 
you know the disease written on their
head<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:09.869> right

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
head or right

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.370 
head or right
affection<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.390> know<00:02:11.480> he<00:02:11.600> they<00:02:12.230> have<00:02:12.350> a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
affection it is you know he they have a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.690 
affection it is you know he they have a
fever<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.770> that's<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.370> got<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.520> kind

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
fever and that's it and you got to kind

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
fever and that's it and you got to kind
of<00:02:13.760> figure<00:02:13.850> out<00:02:14.000> what's<00:02:14.180> wrong<00:02:14.300> with<00:02:14.360> them

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
of figure out what's wrong with them

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.300 
of figure out what's wrong with them
and<00:02:14.810> right<00:02:15.290> from<00:02:15.440> day<00:02:15.470> one<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.010> kind<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and right from day one the kind of the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.040 
and right from day one the kind of the
the<00:02:16.910> program<00:02:17.240> here<00:02:17.360> teaches<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.870> think

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
the program here teaches you to think

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.870 
the program here teaches you to think
like<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.920> doesn't<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.550> doesn't<00:02:19.700> get

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
like that so it doesn't it doesn't get

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.280 
like that so it doesn't it doesn't get
you<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:19.970> memorize<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.690> they<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.080> it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
you to memorize if they have this it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.840 
you to memorize if they have this it
must<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.710> because<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.520> doesn't<00:02:22.700> happen

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
must be that because that doesn't happen

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.580 
must be that because that doesn't happen
in<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.180> real<00:02:23.270> Hall<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.350> course

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
in the real Hall I think this course

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.020 
in the real Hall I think this course
would<00:02:24.770> be<00:02:24.800> probably<00:02:25.400> best<00:02:25.550> for<00:02:25.700> someone<00:02:25.790> who's

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
would be probably best for someone who's

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.510 
would be probably best for someone who's
really<00:02:26.180> self
