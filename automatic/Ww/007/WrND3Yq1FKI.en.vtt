series called on air which is actually

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
series called on air which is actually
one<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> most<00:00:33.390> popular<00:00:33.989> design<00:00:34.320> choices

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
one of the most popular design choices

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.940 
one of the most popular design choices
one<00:00:35.550> thing<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:35.940> very<00:00:36.000> surprised<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.840> find

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
one thing I was very surprised to find

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.369 
one thing I was very surprised to find
for<00:00:37.950> watch<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.390> $200

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
for watch like that to go for $200

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.619 
for watch like that to go for $200
considering<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> smart<00:00:41.640> watch<00:00:41.820> but

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
considering it's not a smart watch but

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.020 
considering it's not a smart watch but
perhaps<00:00:42.809> its<00:00:43.290> touch<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> face<00:00:44.219> may<00:00:44.700> change

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
perhaps its touch in the face may change

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.810 
perhaps its touch in the face may change
my<00:00:45.120> mind<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.840> let's<00:00:46.410> check<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.610> build

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
my mind so let's check it out the build

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
my mind so let's check it out the build
quality<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.570> actual<00:00:48.960> watch<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.500> pretty

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
quality on the actual watch is pretty

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
quality on the actual watch is pretty
solid<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.370> stainless<00:00:50.969> steel<00:00:51.210> frame<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
solid with stainless steel frame and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
solid with stainless steel frame and
clean<00:00:52.170> brown<00:00:52.500> design<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.160> sort<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.399> hides

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
clean brown design that sort of hides

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.180 
clean brown design that sort of hides
its<00:00:53.940> complexity<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.110> glass<00:00:55.379> remains<00:00:55.800> scratch

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
its complexity the glass remains scratch

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
its complexity the glass remains scratch
free<00:00:56.550> even<00:00:57.300> though<00:00:57.510> I've<00:00:57.629> hit<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> couple<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
free even though I've hit it a couple of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.290 
free even though I've hit it a couple of
times<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> steel<00:00:59.609> wristband<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
times but it's the steel wristband that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
times but it's the steel wristband that
doesn't<00:01:00.750> impress<00:01:01.199> me<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.949> tusks<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.370> flimsy

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
doesn't impress me the tusks are flimsy

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
doesn't impress me the tusks are flimsy
it's<00:01:02.940> got<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> play<00:01:03.660> between<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> links

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it's got a lot of play between the links

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
it's got a lot of play between the links
and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> locking<00:01:05.250> mechanism<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:06.420> just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and the locking mechanism is also just

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
and the locking mechanism is also just
mediocre<00:01:07.170> requiring<00:01:08.159> additional<00:01:08.460> force<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
mediocre requiring additional force to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.600 
mediocre requiring additional force to
be<00:01:09.390> properly<00:01:09.840> locked<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.409> place<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> was

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
be properly locked in place so this was

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
be properly locked in place so this was
not<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.330> expecting<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
not at all what I was expecting for the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 
not at all what I was expecting for the
$200<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.030> before<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.869> any<00:01:16.020> features

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
$200 and before we get into any features

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
$200 and before we get into any features
are<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.340> able<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> tell<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> time<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
are you able to tell the time from this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
are you able to tell the time from this
watch<00:01:19.200> right<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> little

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
watch right now I know it's a little

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
watch right now I know it's a little
confusing<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.659> hour-hand<00:01:22.049> position

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
confusing but the hour-hand position

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920 
confusing but the hour-hand position
represents<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> actual<00:01:23.850> hour<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
represents the actual hour and the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
represents the actual hour and the
numbers<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.310> hour<00:01:26.490> hand<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
numbers that make up the hour hand are

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
numbers that make up the hour hand are
the<00:01:27.600> minutes<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> numbers<00:01:28.890> are<00:01:29.070> quite

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the minutes so the numbers are quite

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.980 
the minutes so the numbers are quite
wide<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> little<00:01:30.360> difficult<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
wide it's a little difficult in the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.240 
wide it's a little difficult in the
beginning<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.590> once<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.920> realize<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
beginning but once you realize that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
beginning but once you realize that
those<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.880> numbers<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.960> pretty<00:01:34.380> simple<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
those are numbers it's pretty simple to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.490 
those are numbers it's pretty simple to
tell<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.780> tells<00:01:37.110> us<00:01:37.229> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
tell time so this one here tells us it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
tell time so this one here tells us it's
11:18<00:01:38.460> a.m.<00:01:38.670> while<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.930> shows<00:01:40.250> 542<00:01:41.250> p.m.<00:01:41.869> now

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
11:18 a.m. while this shows 542 p.m. now

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.569 
11:18 a.m. while this shows 542 p.m. now
might<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.110> fun<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> ask<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.100> friends<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
might be fun to ask your friends to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.399 
might be fun to ask your friends to
guess<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> time<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.780> week<00:01:45.960> award

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
guess the time but for the week award

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
guess the time but for the week award
the<00:01:46.590> watch<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:47.820> quite

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the watch it was actually quite

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
the watch it was actually quite
difficult<00:01:48.270> telling<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> minutes<00:01:49.170> by<00:01:49.439> quickly

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
difficult telling the minutes by quickly

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.100 
difficult telling the minutes by quickly
glancing<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> watch<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.600> contrast

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
glancing at the watch the contrast

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
glancing at the watch the contrast
between<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.590> hour<00:01:52.740> clock<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
between the hour clock and the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.060 
between the hour clock and the
background<00:01:54.119> isn't<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> always<00:01:55.799> have

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
background isn't much so you always have

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.069 
background isn't much so you always have
to<00:01:56.189> find<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.759> angle<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to find the right angle to see the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
to find the right angle to see the
numbers<00:01:58.409> correctly<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> backlight

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
numbers correctly there is a backlight

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.060 
numbers correctly there is a backlight
which<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> blue<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.350> actually<00:02:01.680> makes<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.009> more

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
which is blue it actually makes it more

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
which is blue it actually makes it more
difficult<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.630> time<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
difficult to see what time it is so I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
difficult to see what time it is so I
wasn't<00:02:05.250> really<00:02:05.579> impressed

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
wasn't really impressed

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
wasn't really impressed
now<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> LCD<00:02:07.079> does<00:02:07.380> incorporate<00:02:07.680> four<00:02:08.280> touch

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
now the LCD does incorporate four touch

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
now the LCD does incorporate four touch
sensor<00:02:08.940> areas<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.629> individually

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
sensor areas that individually

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.070 
sensor areas that individually
controlled<00:02:10.800> backlight<00:02:11.430> date<00:02:12.090> time<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.629> alarm

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
controlled backlight date time and alarm

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.710 
controlled backlight date time and alarm
you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.120 
you
so<00:02:13.780> I've<00:02:13.870> left<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> right<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.650> unlock<00:02:14.770> to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
so I've left the right to unlock to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.040 
so I've left the right to unlock to
watch<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:15.970> presented<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.390> these<00:02:16.630> pop

you set the alarm time the same way as
before<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:49.300> not<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> most<00:02:49.660> convenient

the<00:03:30.310> mediocre<00:03:30.910> wristbands<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.260> clamp<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
the mediocre wristbands and the clamp to

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.009 
the mediocre wristbands and the clamp to
poor<00:03:33.190> backlight<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.030> very<00:03:34.750> uncomfortable

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
poor backlight and very uncomfortable

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.259 
poor backlight and very uncomfortable
touch<00:03:35.590> interface<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.610> very<00:03:36.820> difficult<00:03:37.150> to

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
touch interface it's very difficult to

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.360 
touch interface it's very difficult to
tell<00:03:37.450> time<00:03:37.750> not<00:03:38.080> because<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.470> how<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.860> time<00:03:39.190> is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
tell time not because of how the time is

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.930 
tell time not because of how the time is
displayed

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
displayed

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.210 
displayed
but<00:03:40.540> because<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.050> contrast<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:42.010> low

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
but because the contrast is so low

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.310 
but because the contrast is so low
between<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.700> hour<00:03:42.790> hand<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.810> background

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
between the hour hand and the background

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.800 
between the hour hand and the background
that<00:03:44.860> makes<00:03:45.070> it<00:03:45.220> quite<00:03:45.730> hard<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.269> distinguish

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
that makes it quite hard to distinguish

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.920 
that makes it quite hard to distinguish
so<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.799> value<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.459> extremely<00:03:49.420> difficult<00:03:49.630> to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
so the value is extremely difficult to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.320 
so the value is extremely difficult to
justify<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:51.640> do<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.760> guys<00:03:51.940> think<00:03:52.239> of

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
justify but what do you guys think of

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.050 
justify but what do you guys think of
this<00:03:52.480> concept<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:53.230> complicated<00:03:54.070> time<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.700> it

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
this concept of complicated time is it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.270 
this concept of complicated time is it
cool<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.450> would<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.750> ever<00:03:55.780> get<00:03:56.380> one<00:03:56.620> let<00:03:57.160> us
