halfway through modern warfare 3 is
pretty<00:00:24.210> much<00:00:24.300> when<00:00:24.480> i<00:00:24.510> starred<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.289> stop

losing games for the most part you know
when<00:00:30.449> loss<00:00:30.630> became<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.289> big<00:00:31.439> factor<00:00:31.859> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
when loss became a really big factor in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
when loss became a really big factor in
a<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.850> much<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.180> i<00:00:33.210> play<00:00:33.510> video<00:00:33.660> games

loss<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> guys<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.890> pretty<00:01:41.130> much<00:01:41.189> how<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
loss for you guys and pretty much how I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.440 
loss for you guys and pretty much how I
did<00:01:41.850> lose<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.369> I'm<00:01:44.369> using<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.880> assault<00:01:45.210> package

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
did lose so I'm using an assault package

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
did lose so I'm using an assault package
which<00:01:45.869> I'd<00:01:46.110> recommend<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.829> Stonehaven<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
which I'd recommend on Stonehaven just

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.789 
which I'd recommend on Stonehaven just
because<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> competitive<00:01:49.380> game<00:01:49.590> he

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
because if it's a competitive game he

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.139 
because if it's a competitive game he
probably<00:01:49.950> gonna<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:50.520> streaks<00:01:50.820> okay

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
probably gonna want some streaks okay

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
probably gonna want some streaks okay
you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.360> help<00:01:51.600> protect<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.110> flags<00:01:52.409> because

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you know help protect your flags because

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.280 
you know help protect your flags because
you're<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.189> far<00:01:53.490> away<00:01:53.579> from<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.290> um

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you're so far away from them and um

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.010 
you're so far away from them and um
pretty<00:01:55.710> much<00:01:56.060> there's<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.329> main<00:01:57.540> reasons<00:01:57.719> why

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
pretty much there's two main reasons why

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.950 
pretty much there's two main reasons why
we<00:01:58.170> lost<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.530> game<00:01:59.509> first<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.899> were

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
we lost this game first of all we were

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.800 
we lost this game first of all we were
in<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> party<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> three<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.479> I'd<00:02:03.479> normally

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
in a party of three and I'd normally

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.109 
in a party of three and I'd normally
only<00:02:04.320> play<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> party<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.520> four<00:02:05.850> for

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
only play in a party of four for

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.389 
only play in a party of four for
domination<00:02:06.479> I'll<00:02:06.719> usually<00:02:06.840> don't<00:02:07.110> play

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
domination I'll usually don't play

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.660 
domination I'll usually don't play
anywhere<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.970> party<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.539> four<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.989> six

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
anywhere from my party for four to six

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.800 
anywhere from my party for four to six
sometimes<00:02:11.670> five<00:02:11.910> sometimes<00:02:12.450> four

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
sometimes five sometimes four

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.180 
sometimes five sometimes four
sometimes<00:02:13.319> six<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.680> doesn't<00:02:13.890> really<00:02:13.980> matter

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
sometimes six it doesn't really matter

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.160 
sometimes six it doesn't really matter
but<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.060> game<00:02:15.239> we're<00:02:15.390> only<00:02:15.510> playing<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
but this game we're only playing on a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.290 
but this game we're only playing on a
party<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.530> three<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.069> someone<00:02:17.970> backed<00:02:18.150> out

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
party of three and someone backed out

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.520 
party of three and someone backed out
before<00:02:18.540> his<00:02:18.660> game<00:02:18.690> start<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.290> thought<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
before his game start and I thought to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.830 
before his game start and I thought to
myself<00:02:19.650> should<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.430> leave<00:02:20.819> shied<00:02:21.360> really

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
myself should I just leave shied really

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.420 
myself should I just leave shied really
risk<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.410> chance<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.890> know<00:02:23.069> our<00:02:23.190> Rams

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
risk the chance of you know our Rams

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.880 
risk the chance of you know our Rams
being<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.970> bad<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:25.440> course<00:02:25.530> that's

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
being that bad and of course that's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
being that bad and of course that's
pretty<00:02:26.310> much<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> reasons<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.330> we

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
pretty much one of the reasons that we

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
pretty much one of the reasons that we
lost<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.500> had<00:02:28.640> randoms<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
lost was that we had randoms that

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.610 
lost was that we had randoms that
compiler<00:02:30.540> through<00:02:30.720> randoms<00:02:31.080> combined<00:02:31.470> I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
compiler through randoms combined I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460 
compiler through randoms combined I
think<00:02:31.830> for<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:31.980> captures<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.230> two<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
think for for captures and two of the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.809 
think for for captures and two of the
randoms<00:02:34.769> which<00:02:34.950> were<00:02:35.069> splits<00:02:35.340> greatest<00:02:35.700> they

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
randoms which were splits greatest they

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.839 
randoms which were splits greatest they
went<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.239> combined<00:02:36.959> total<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.470> four<00:02:37.950> kills<00:02:38.519> and

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
went a combined total of four kills and

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.949 
went a combined total of four kills and
like<00:02:39.000> 45<00:02:39.540> deaths<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.709> um<00:02:41.390> yeah<00:02:42.390> they're<00:02:42.810> pretty

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
like 45 deaths so um yeah they're pretty

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.150 
like 45 deaths so um yeah they're pretty
much<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.349> reason<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.680> lost<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.069> game

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
much the reason we lost this game

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.430 
much the reason we lost this game
another<00:02:45.120> contributing<00:02:45.660> factor<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.260> big

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
another contributing factor that was big

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.400 
another contributing factor that was big
was<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> fact<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.069> was<00:02:47.340> Stonehaven<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.690> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
was the fact that was Stonehaven that it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.500 
was the fact that was Stonehaven that it
seemed<00:02:49.769> like<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.459> map<00:02:50.730> because<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.330> kept

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
seemed like on this map because we kept

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.330 
seemed like on this map because we kept
fluctuating<00:02:52.110> flag<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.620> much<00:02:52.769> taking<00:02:53.190> them

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
fluctuating flag so much taking them

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.800 
fluctuating flag so much taking them
capturing<00:02:53.819> them<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.090> defending<00:02:54.510> them<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
capturing them to defending them and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.270 
capturing them to defending them and
then<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.049> know<00:02:55.140> losing<00:02:55.500> them<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.069> catch

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
then you know losing them and then catch

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.360 
then you know losing them and then catch
from<00:02:56.459> him<00:02:56.610> back<00:02:56.819> was<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> fact<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.140> uh<00:02:58.709> just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
from him back was the fact that uh just

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.530 
from him back was the fact that uh just
me<00:02:59.519> personally<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.000> don't<00:03:00.150> know<00:03:00.239> about<00:03:00.330> my

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
me personally I don't know about my

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.850 
me personally I don't know about my
other<00:03:00.630> two<00:03:00.840> teammates<00:03:01.200> because<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.680> did

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
other two teammates because they did

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.920 
other two teammates because they did
pretty<00:03:02.010> good<00:03:02.160> themselves<00:03:03.380> pretty<00:03:04.380> much<00:03:05.930> we'd

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
pretty good themselves pretty much we'd

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.199 
pretty good themselves pretty much we'd
be<00:03:07.170> sitting<00:03:07.590> at<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.830> we'd<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.310> defending<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.910> and

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
be sitting at a we'd be defending a and

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.870 
be sitting at a we'd be defending a and
then<00:03:09.510> we<00:03:09.900> lose<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.380> flag<00:03:10.680> at<00:03:10.860> sea<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.519> know

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
then we lose a flag at sea so you know

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.520 
then we lose a flag at sea so you know
I'd<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.480> run<00:03:12.599> all<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> way<00:03:12.900> over<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> see

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
I'd have to run all the way over to see

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770 
I'd have to run all the way over to see
and<00:03:13.830> since<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.060> far<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.569> takes

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and since it's so far and it takes

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.720 
and since it's so far and it takes
legitimately<00:03:16.410> about<00:03:16.709> 30<00:03:17.010> seconds<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.519> get

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
legitimately about 30 seconds to get

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.360 
legitimately about 30 seconds to get
there<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.810> know<00:03:18.840> 20<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.799> about<00:03:19.920> 20<00:03:20.220> 30

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
there you know 20 you have about 20 30

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.610 
there you know 20 you have about 20 30
seconds<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.850> get<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> other<00:03:21.239> flag<00:03:21.620> you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
seconds to get to the other flag you

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.500 
seconds to get to the other flag you
know<00:03:22.739> by<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.280> time<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.579> got<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.880> see<00:03:24.239> and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
know by the time I got to see and

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.870 
know by the time I got to see and
started<00:03:25.079> fighting<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.530> capture<00:03:25.920> back<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
started fighting the capture back you

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.580 
started fighting the capture back you
know<00:03:26.970> we'd<00:03:27.150> be<00:03:27.269> losing<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.870> lost<00:03:28.049> 8<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
know we'd be losing a and lost 8 and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.650 
know we'd be losing a and lost 8 and
maybe<00:03:28.769> we<00:03:28.920> lost<00:03:29.100> be<00:03:29.370> basically<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.450> was

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
maybe we lost be basically what it was

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.110 
maybe we lost be basically what it was
was<00:03:30.950> we<00:03:31.950> couldn't<00:03:32.100> really<00:03:32.400> hold<00:03:32.640> down<00:03:32.880> one

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
was we couldn't really hold down one

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880 
was we couldn't really hold down one

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
soon as we leave one flag you know the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.490 
soon as we leave one flag you know the
the<00:03:39.000> enemies<00:03:39.359> are<00:03:39.540> well<00:03:39.900> our<00:03:40.019> stupid<00:03:40.319> little

they<00:03:42.359> couldn't<00:03:42.600> protect<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.989> flag<00:03:43.200> for<00:03:43.380> life's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.129 
they couldn't protect a flag for life's
and<00:03:44.299> matter<00:03:45.299> of<00:03:45.389> fact<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:45.810> weren't<00:03:45.989> really

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
and matter of fact they weren't really

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.190 
and matter of fact they weren't really
near<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> flags<00:03:46.980> most<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.549> game

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200

near of the flags most of the game
another<00:03:49.200> big<00:03:49.709> reason<00:03:49.950> why<00:03:50.130> we<00:03:50.340> lost<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:51.269> due

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
another big reason why we lost is due

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.819 
another big reason why we lost is due
the<00:03:51.569> fact<00:03:51.720> because<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.290> randoms<00:03:52.620> was

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
the fact because the randoms was

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.039 
the fact because the randoms was
basically<00:03:53.670> because<00:03:54.090> they'd<00:03:54.389> be<00:03:54.450> sitting<00:03:54.750> in

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
basically because they'd be sitting in

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.680 
basically because they'd be sitting in
far<00:03:55.440> corners<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.160> map<00:03:56.400> I'm<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.389> giving

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
far corners of the map I'm just giving

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.590 
far corners of the map I'm just giving
us<00:03:57.780> bad<00:03:58.019> spawns<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:59.010> you<00:04:00.000> guys<00:04:00.180> know<00:04:00.359> if<00:04:00.480> you're

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
us bad spawns so you guys know if you're

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.000 
us bad spawns so you guys know if you're
holding<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.959> flag<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.560> know<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.769> have

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
holding a flag and you know you have

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.580 
holding a flag and you know you have
teammates<00:04:02.340> near<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> flag<00:04:03.060> if<00:04:03.299> if<00:04:04.139> you<00:04:04.350> died

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
teammates near a flag if if you died

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.410 
teammates near a flag if if you died
near<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:04.980> flag<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.489> won't<00:04:05.639> spawn<00:04:05.940> way<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.329> the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
near the flag you won't spawn way on the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.550 
near the flag you won't spawn way on the
middle<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.690> nowhere<00:04:07.019> most<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.410> time

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
middle of nowhere most of the time

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.080 
middle of nowhere most of the time
you'll<00:04:07.799> spawn<00:04:07.980> pretty<00:04:08.310> close<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.700> where<00:04:08.880> you

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
you'll spawn pretty close to where you

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.610 
you'll spawn pretty close to where you
know<00:04:09.209> most<00:04:09.510> your<00:04:09.690> teammates<00:04:10.139> are<00:04:10.350> where<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
know most your teammates are where the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.319 
know most your teammates are where the
flag<00:04:10.889> is<00:04:10.920> most<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.639> time<00:04:11.850> right<00:04:12.209> because

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
flag is most of the time right because

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.420 
flag is most of the time right because
that's<00:04:12.540> your<00:04:12.720> flag<00:04:13.049> well<00:04:13.829> we<00:04:13.950> had<00:04:14.040> teammates

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that's your flag well we had teammates

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.159 
that's your flag well we had teammates
that<00:04:14.609> were<00:04:14.700> nowhere<00:04:15.030> near<00:04:15.420> flags<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.109> they

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
that were nowhere near flags and they

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.870 
that were nowhere near flags and they
just<00:04:16.350> being<00:04:16.500> random<00:04:16.739> parts<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.400> Stonehaven

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
just being random parts of Stonehaven

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.420 
just being random parts of Stonehaven
and<00:04:18.209> they<00:04:18.660> spawn<00:04:19.019> us<00:04:19.200> out<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:19.919> point<00:04:20.220> where

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
and they spawn us out to the point where

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.399 
and they spawn us out to the point where
we<00:04:20.909> weren't<00:04:21.120> close<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:22.260> the

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
we weren't close to the like the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.500 
we weren't close to the like the
objective<00:04:22.890> anymore<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.789> we<00:04:23.880> kept<00:04:24.060> getting<00:04:24.180> bad

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
objective anymore so we kept getting bad

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.790 
objective anymore so we kept getting bad
spawns<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.590> got

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
spawns if you got

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.490 
spawns if you got
remember<00:04:26.069> in<00:04:26.190> her<00:04:26.370> hard<00:04:27.150> point<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:28.349> know<00:04:28.440> you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
remember in her hard point you know you

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.200 
remember in her hard point you know you
have<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:28.979> rotate<00:04:29.430> early<00:04:29.819> you<00:04:29.909> have<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.090> get

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
have to rotate early you have to get

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.089 
have to rotate early you have to get
those<00:04:30.360> spawns<00:04:30.750> early<00:04:31.259> right<00:04:31.470> cuz<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.919> know<00:04:32.009> if

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
those spawns early right cuz you know if

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.950 
those spawns early right cuz you know if
you<00:04:32.190> get<00:04:32.280> spawned<00:04:32.610> off<00:04:32.789> a<00:04:32.849> hill<00:04:33.180> then<00:04:33.479> uh<00:04:33.509> you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
you get spawned off a hill then uh you

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.930 
you get spawned off a hill then uh you
know<00:04:34.409> it's<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.710> whole<00:04:34.860> no<00:04:35.190> it's<00:04:35.340> not<00:04:35.430> good<00:04:35.729> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
know it's the whole no it's not good so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.460 
know it's the whole no it's not good so
that's<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.180> whole<00:04:36.330> point<00:04:36.539> of<00:04:36.659> rotating<00:04:37.229> so

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
that's the whole point of rotating so

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.040 
that's the whole point of rotating so
it's<00:04:38.190> kind<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.460> like<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.849> to<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> certain

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
it's kind of like that to a certain

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.960 
it's kind of like that to a certain
extent<00:04:40.440> pretty<00:04:41.220> much<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.699> can<00:04:41.819> see<00:04:41.940> our

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
extent pretty much so you can see our

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.279 
extent pretty much so you can see our
random<00:04:42.360> right<00:04:42.449> there<00:04:42.629> what<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.810> fuck<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.199> he

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
random right there what the fuck is he

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.960 
random right there what the fuck is he
doing<00:04:43.560> they'd<00:04:44.039> be<00:04:44.099> sitting<00:04:44.370> in<00:04:44.550> weird<00:04:44.819> spots

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
doing they'd be sitting in weird spots

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.760 
doing they'd be sitting in weird spots
just<00:04:45.330> getting<00:04:45.599> us<00:04:45.690> really<00:04:45.960> bad<00:04:46.110> spots<00:04:46.500> and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
just getting us really bad spots and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.350 
just getting us really bad spots and
we'd<00:04:46.860> have<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.129> run<00:04:47.340> all<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.729> way<00:04:47.759> just<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.180> get

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
we'd have to run all the way just to get

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.480 
we'd have to run all the way just to get
to<00:04:48.389> the<00:04:48.599> action<00:04:48.960> again<00:04:49.229> where<00:04:49.889> you<00:04:50.280> know<00:04:50.370> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
to the action again where you know the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.980 
to the action again where you know the
other<00:04:50.610> teammates<00:04:50.970> kept<00:04:51.210> spawning<00:04:51.509> near<00:04:51.870> the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
other teammates kept spawning near the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.899 
other teammates kept spawning near the
objective<00:04:52.470> just<00:04:52.740> simply<00:04:53.159> because<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.789> know

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
objective just simply because you know

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.610 
objective just simply because you know
they<00:04:54.060> were<00:04:54.120> around<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.870> objective<00:04:55.349> most<00:04:55.530> of

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
they were around the objective most of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.700 
they were around the objective most of
the<00:04:55.680> time<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:57.210> uh<00:04:57.270> yeah<00:04:58.080> that's<00:04:58.409> pretty<00:04:58.590> much

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
the time but uh yeah that's pretty much

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.640 
the time but uh yeah that's pretty much
you<00:04:59.400> know<00:04:59.479> the<00:05:00.479> two<00:05:00.690> biggest<00:05:00.900> factors<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.530> why

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
you know the two biggest factors of why

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.070 
you know the two biggest factors of why
we<00:05:01.800> lost<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.280> game<00:05:02.400> um<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:03.629> know<00:05:03.719> I<00:05:03.750> really

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
we lost this game um you know I really

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.480 
we lost this game um you know I really
didn't<00:05:04.259> play<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.530> greatest<00:05:04.949> myself<00:05:05.370> I

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
didn't play the greatest myself I

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.089 
didn't play the greatest myself I
definitely<00:05:05.729> didn't<00:05:06.030> do<00:05:06.120> bad<00:05:06.419> I<00:05:07.169> think<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.949> did

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
definitely didn't do bad I think I did

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.770 
definitely didn't do bad I think I did
pretty<00:05:08.129> good<00:05:08.400> Katie<00:05:08.819> wise<00:05:09.150> but<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:09.599> really

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
pretty good Katie wise but that really

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.170 
pretty good Katie wise but that really
wasn't<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.229> biggest<00:05:10.379> point<00:05:10.789> this<00:05:11.789> team<00:05:11.969> kind

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
wasn't the biggest point this team kind

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.790 
wasn't the biggest point this team kind
of<00:05:12.210> took<00:05:12.389> us<00:05:12.599> out<00:05:12.780> of<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.110> objective<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
of took us out of the objective to the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.230 
of took us out of the objective to the
point<00:05:14.039> where<00:05:14.159> we<00:05:14.250> just<00:05:14.400> almost<00:05:14.610> didn't<00:05:14.969> have<00:05:15.210> a

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
point where we just almost didn't have a

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.869 
point where we just almost didn't have a
chance<00:05:15.629> to<00:05:15.840> come<00:05:16.080> back<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:17.639> know<00:05:17.729> they

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
chance to come back you know they

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.249 
chance to come back you know they
started<00:05:18.150> pulling<00:05:18.300> way<00:05:18.539> around<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:19.020> time

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
started pulling way around this time

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.800 
started pulling way around this time
simply<00:05:20.129> because<00:05:20.370> they<00:05:21.060> started<00:05:21.599> getting

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
simply because they started getting

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.779 
simply because they started getting
organized<00:05:22.259> and<00:05:22.650> we<00:05:22.860> never<00:05:23.099> got<00:05:23.310> organized

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
organized and we never got organized

day<00:06:53.350> when<00:06:53.890> i<00:06:53.920> thought<00:06:54.220> my<00:06:54.280> stats<00:06:54.730> were<00:06:54.880> high

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
day when i thought my stats were high

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.120 
day when i thought my stats were high
with<00:06:55.210> my<00:06:55.330> 3kd<00:06:55.870> and<00:06:56.140> my<00:06:56.230> four<00:06:56.470> win-loss<00:06:56.830> I'm

sure if I saw Katie and win loss like
that<00:06:58.990> I<00:06:59.140> probably<00:06:59.470> would<00:06:59.680> have<00:06:59.740> thought<00:06:59.890> this

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
that I probably would have thought this

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.040 
that I probably would have thought this
guy<00:07:00.280> is<00:07:00.340> either<00:07:00.490> a<00:07:00.640> cheater<00:07:00.970> he's<00:07:01.390> hacking<00:07:01.900> he

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050
