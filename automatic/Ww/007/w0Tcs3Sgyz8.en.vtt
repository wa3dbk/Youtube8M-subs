00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
hey guys more physics here today we've

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.250 
hey guys more physics here today we've
been<00:00:16.219> buying<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.760> new<00:00:16.939> series<00:00:17.270> or<00:00:18.020> photo

showcasing<00:00:21.290> at<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.099> elite<00:00:22.369> guns<00:00:22.700> that<00:00:22.939> I<00:00:23.000> have

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
showcasing at the elite guns that I have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.929 
showcasing at the elite guns that I have
so<00:00:23.599> far<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.340> hopefully<00:00:25.340> i'll<00:00:25.610> get<00:00:25.730> more

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
so far and hopefully i'll get more

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.330 
so far and hopefully i'll get more
because<00:00:26.360> i<00:00:26.599> don't<00:00:26.869> really<00:00:27.050> have<00:00:27.259> that<00:00:27.290> many<00:00:27.619> so

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
because i don't really have that many so

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.190 
because i don't really have that many so
today<00:00:28.880> we're<00:00:28.970> going<00:00:29.060> to<00:00:29.149> go<00:00:29.660> again<00:00:29.989> and<00:00:30.079> we'll

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
today we're going to go again and we'll

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.729 
today we're going to go again and we'll
be<00:00:30.290> starting<00:00:30.680> with<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.340> pie<00:00:32.210> take<00:00:32.509> us<00:00:33.320> on<00:00:33.500> what

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
be starting with the pie take us on what

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.850 
be starting with the pie take us on what
we<00:00:33.770> call<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.100> loophole<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:34.940> yes<00:00:35.870> an<00:00:36.079> LMG<00:00:36.530> and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
we call that loophole and yes an LMG and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.620 
we call that loophole and yes an LMG and
as<00:00:37.370> you<00:00:37.460> can<00:00:37.579> see<00:00:37.610> on<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.850> right<00:00:38.000> hand<00:00:38.149> side<00:00:38.239> it

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
as you can see on the right hand side it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.790 
as you can see on the right hand side it
has<00:00:38.809> plus<00:00:39.290> plus<00:00:39.770> 1<00:00:40.040> accuracy<00:00:41.000> as<00:00:41.510> plus<00:00:41.899> 2<00:00:42.170> ammo

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
has plus plus 1 accuracy as plus 2 ammo

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.569 
has plus plus 1 accuracy as plus 2 ammo
so<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.429> think<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.940> has<00:00:44.079> 150<00:00:45.079> mo<00:00:45.620> instead<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.010> 100

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
so I think it has 150 mo instead of 100

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.419 
so I think it has 150 mo instead of 100
and<00:00:46.789> has<00:00:47.629> minus<00:00:47.899> 3<00:00:48.289> mobility<00:00:48.829> as<00:00:48.949> you<00:00:49.070> can<00:00:49.219> see

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
and has minus 3 mobility as you can see

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.290 
and has minus 3 mobility as you can see
how<00:00:49.609> slowly<00:00:50.359> i'm<00:00:50.629> running<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.969> yeah<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.149> this

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
how slowly i'm running and yeah so this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.090 
how slowly i'm running and yeah so this
gun<00:00:53.510> really<00:00:54.109> doesn't<00:00:54.469> have<00:00:54.589> that<00:00:54.739> much<00:00:54.920> free

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
gun really doesn't have that much free

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.579 
gun really doesn't have that much free
coil<00:00:55.460> like<00:00:55.820> at<00:00:56.149> first<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.809> kind<00:00:57.079> of<00:00:57.140> kicks<00:00:57.350> up

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
coil like at first it kind of kicks up

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.639 
coil like at first it kind of kicks up
as<00:00:58.429> you<00:00:58.579> can<00:00:58.699> see<00:00:58.870> kind<00:00:59.870> of<00:00:59.960> kicks<00:01:00.230> up<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.409> bit

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
as you can see kind of kicks up a bit

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.439 
as you can see kind of kicks up a bit
but<00:01:00.800> then<00:01:00.920> after<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.399> it's<00:01:01.579> Teddy's<00:01:01.940> itself

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
but then after that it's Teddy's itself

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.340 
but then after that it's Teddy's itself
i'm<00:01:02.659> just<00:01:03.199> literally<00:01:03.890> fire<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.580> laser<00:01:05.230> as<00:01:06.230> you

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
i'm just literally fire the laser as you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.810 
i'm just literally fire the laser as you
can<00:01:06.440> see<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.710> doesn't<00:01:07.010> really<00:01:07.100> move<00:01:07.490> up<00:01:07.760> or

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
can see it doesn't really move up or

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.440 
can see it doesn't really move up or
down<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.710> fire<00:01:09.890> rate<00:01:10.070> isn't<00:01:10.250> too<00:01:10.580> bad<00:01:10.729> i'm

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
down and the fire rate isn't too bad i'm

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.550 
down and the fire rate isn't too bad i'm
free<00:01:12.020> part<00:01:12.670> yeah<00:01:13.670> it's<00:01:13.850> alright<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.440> as<00:01:15.440> you

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
free part yeah it's alright and as you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.980 
free part yeah it's alright and as you
can<00:01:15.710> see<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:16.040> your<00:01:16.430> basic<00:01:16.610> movement<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.420> kind

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
can see just your basic movement is kind

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.530 
can see just your basic movement is kind
of<00:01:18.110> slow<00:01:18.440> yes<00:01:19.340> because<00:01:19.940> it's<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.150> heavy<00:01:20.330> web

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
of slow yes because it's a heavy web

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.070 
of slow yes because it's a heavy web
person<00:01:20.870> plus<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.350> has<00:01:21.440> minus<00:01:21.920> 3<00:01:22.510> mobility<00:01:23.510> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
person plus it has minus 3 mobility and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.650 
person plus it has minus 3 mobility and
as<00:01:24.650> always<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.010> reload<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.400> kind<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.760> slow<00:01:26.060> so

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
as always the reload is kind of slow so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.280 
as always the reload is kind of slow so
take<00:01:27.530> cover<00:01:27.710> something<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.050> should<00:01:30.050> run

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
take cover something up so should run

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.400 
take cover something up so should run
either<00:01:31.000> lightweight<00:01:32.000> or<00:01:32.270> like<00:01:32.900> quick<00:01:33.200> draw

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
either lightweight or like quick draw

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.160 
either lightweight or like quick draw
something<00:01:33.860> sir<00:01:34.100> mix<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.790> lot<00:01:34.940> more<00:01:35.090> easier<00:01:35.300> so

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
something sir mix a lot more easier so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.570 
something sir mix a lot more easier so
