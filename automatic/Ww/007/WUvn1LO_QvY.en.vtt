00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 new video I am Ã¡lvarez del vayo and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.759
 Today I will give you my opinion on how 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:18.720
 people sometimes treat their phones not 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:21.020
 they are stones are broken if then we 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.020
 we complain 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.400
 today's video is inspired by another 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.670
 of that anecdote that happens to me even though you're 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.470
 recurrent and that is that many times when 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.260
 someone asks me what mobile is bought 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.570
 Well, one of the things he says is me 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.330
 I want it to be tough when the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.120
 people say I want it to be tough 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.579
 normally think of a Nokia 33-10 a 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.940
 mobile that when you fell you broke 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.680
 the floor tile not the mobile no longer 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.949
 there are that kind of mobile there are more 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.750
 resistant there are less and we can 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.730
 have more or less care when it comes to 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.910
 choose but and here it comes in my 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.610
 comment when I see a person 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.860
 leave on the mobile on the table and 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.020
 well there are times that people leave it with 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 careful people who put a cover but there 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.220
 others that have the same subtlety that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.820
 a soldier throwing a fucking grenade in 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.910
 a minefield that is to say is a mobile is 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.830
 something dedicated be careful as usual 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.800
 I do not say on the table that you have a thousand 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.210
 eyes but I've seen mobiles that 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.670
 it seems that a tank has passed through 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.350
 above and they are mobile that are not 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.780
 especially delicate others yes 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 the truth I analyzed mobile I've 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.979
 lying on the floor to take a picture to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.570
 I made a contrapicado 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.100
 It has fallen 15 centimeters 15 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.509
 centimeters is a less than a quarter 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.659
 mine and it has been spoken twice you say 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.210
 if I drop half a meter it explodes 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.909
 very dedicated mobile phones and there are others that do not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.100
 but my comment goes about those 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.899
 people who are not careful at the time 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.119
 to treat the mobile when they leave it to 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.659
 tenth promise do not throw it away leave it 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.450
 supported if you know it is scratched by a 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.610
 funda but good a cover more or less 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.810
 fine at the end too many people do not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.370
 I'm going to buy this phone because it's 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.110
 beautiful because it has an aesthetic 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.280
 line out in your hand and then there's the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.519
 puts a cover of three euros of the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.519
 chinese 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.590
 it does not make any sense if you have to 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.540
 a bag and puts it in the bag because 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.000
 We carry the bandolier because she is a woman and 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.420
 carried in the bag and so on 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.070
 law a cover of the two sides not 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.470
 you want if you follow they have put a cover 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.990
 I was down with the screen down 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.050
 by one of the ones that covered the screen myself 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.630
 I personally never use covers but I 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.600
 I always carry the phone in my pocket 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.210
 I never put anything else in that pocket and 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.380
 still just by the mere fact of 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.930
 leave the mobile on a table 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.120
 for a lot of time it's supported by 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.010
 supports the support supports it the values the wave 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.560
 it ends up damaging the back 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.270
 what is good because we can change 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.830
 the casing we can but if 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.210
 I had a cell phone that should not be 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.520
 change the housing or that is aluminum 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.710
 obviously you can not have 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.450
 beware of him if he falls for example there 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.550
 more or less resistant mobile 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.800
 hired an insurance if I'm a little 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.300
 big hands there are people who have told me is 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.760
 shirt I drop the phone more or less a 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.040
 once a day but god to treat the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.650
 doll put one of those tapes that you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.150
 used in compact cameras and not 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.060
 let go of the mobile 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.480
 I do not know, cover yourself with pillows 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.860
 when you use the question with the subject 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.379
 of the resistance of the mobile thirst 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.849
 careful to tell the people who are 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.849
 mobile phones are devices 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 delicate is not that we are talking about 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.099
 porcelain and crystal of bohemian though 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.689
 in some cases yes but good to put 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.670
 a glass screen protector 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.290
 tempered for example if that you think that 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.269
 is going to help you 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.219
 do not take it to the bathroom that 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.079
 then the mobiles get wet they fall 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.790
 slide etc. it 's true that there 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.709
 some that seem to enjoy 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.810
 throwing themselves on the ground alone but they are 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.549
 minority the issue there is mobile is more 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.879
 resistant for example motorbike motors 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.670
 on motorcycle gp I've seen he was going to say 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.590
 resistance tests but that's 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.079
 recordings of mass destruction and still 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.880
 so they have cost a lot to destroy it 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.250
 if you really value work in the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.590
 field with heavy material in a workshop 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.780
 hey let's go some idea buy a 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.479
 housing of those military or look at some 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.759
 terminal with galaxy resistance 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.250
 activate for example or similar do not 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.430
 xcover but for the rest of the 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.830
 deadly people more or less normal 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.870
 just be careful if you do not know if 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.060
 you have found some history 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.919
 or yourselves are a little is 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.080
 neglected that also with a little bit of 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.120
 self-criticism I the first there was once 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.949
 the one that I dropped a mobile from that 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.870
 moment in the previous days years not 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.759
 I had fallen and from that moment 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.710
 well, more or less once every three months 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.480
 it fell out I guess it 's my age 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.370
 I get older and I get clumsy 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.020
 what's said leave us a comment tell us 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.180
 your experiences will also 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.790
 we invite you to subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.990
 a personal opinion we will activate the 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.870
 new cards on youtube 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.280
 this the same when two years go by and 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.660
 the cards are no longer active this 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.360
 video does not make any sense but good 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.370
 on YouTube is what you do if you like 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.750
 you do not say it and if you do not like it we think 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.630
 a little bit annoying as well 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.240
 We will try to study how to implement it 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.170
 without giving much to say hello and we 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.170
 we see in the following video
