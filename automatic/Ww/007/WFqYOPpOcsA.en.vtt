00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.539
 Greetings or greetings god 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.039
 welcome to a first 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.630
 hotspot pictures hundred thousand clicks 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.189
 can you make 50,000 cheaper by 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.989
 Just a player exchanges that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.149
 I'll show you then I will 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.859
 Just explain when the time 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.440
 has come and I have already 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.660
 I apologize for always second 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.129
 controller press but I have none 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.929
 I do not know how the others are doing 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.250
 the life house is my first time please 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.079
 Do not be too strict so I do not have one 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.879
 plan to do this as the others do 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 and therefore just catch it now 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.870
 on in the gate 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.510
 with our good old culture 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.659
 actually a young goalie right 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.789
 cheap really good goalkeeper 199 tall 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.260
 So now 480 reviews there 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.589
 you can not do anything wrong there 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 just make her anything wrong as 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.170
 first defender is miranda we go 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.060
 not long for the bush he is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.450
 a super defender really cheap 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 So really fast strong in progress 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.490
 so medium working rates already 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.869
 once who goes there you get already 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.890
 the one or the other stalls if one the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.110
 values ​​of the teams well company is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.939
 ever a very expensive player for 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.770
 This squad is actually cheap 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.289
 except for two and one of them is just 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.180
 company but very solid values ​​so what 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.270
 is solid old sick defensive values 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.219
 then also medium medium working advise then 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.509
 we have the right-back 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.409
 teammates from compagnie 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.460
 that's because Roger has good ones too 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.789
 defensive and is actually very 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.579
 Well 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.259
 Unfortunately, only two stalls in a row 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 but I bought it for 4000 calls 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.969
 I have no idea why I'm so stupid 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.680
 but well what do you want to do too late 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.450
 Eat but we do not care about the price 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.340
 I always buy the first players like that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.479
 fuck it all 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.700
 well as a central defensive 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.549
 midfielder javi garcia the der 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.160
 only in the team of the medium high working 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.200
 has rates 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.650
 defensive good header defended and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.220
 really cheaper player and is always 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.760
 in the back then in the az we have 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.650
 fr like martinez von bavern also good 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.350
 values ​​defensives above all he is 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.750
 should also shows he is holding the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.090
 box just clean so I drive ahead 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.910
 So the box seems to be medium 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.710
 Unfortunately, labor rates only men 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.800
 Wednesdays would have rolled the alba left 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.590
 full back true basic right 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.100
 basic really fast too good 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.720
 dribbling 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.000
 really cheap I have no idea 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.960
 Games do not buy how much it costs 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760
 then fuck it 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.680
 he does work well, too 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.900
 with the front and yes, unfortunately not that's it 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.820
 not the best work is easy 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.920
 plays on defensive with the spot and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.360
 let's go on to toni kroos one more 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.390
 minute 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.490
 Toni Kroos has a hammer shot hammer 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.320
 fit, he's just really slow has 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.720
 he so slowly next to mertesacker and 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.730
 a fun did not run so slowly 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.040
 expect really bad slow on 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.290
 any case but a sick player then 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.510
 here we have mario götze 990 dribbling 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.790
 72 shot full little finally shot but 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.830
 it seems to me believe me it comes 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.270
 you want to buy more 59,000 calls 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.560
 I think it's overkill 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.750
 i think i've become much cheaper though 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.680
 As I said, I do not pay much attention to that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.000
 Price and exchange easily with draxler 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.110
 if you are too expensive for he is 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.220
 actually finally better or just 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:46.209
 Well then we have with Italy the with 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.610
 The glaring also has solid values 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.860
 I'm surprised of 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.810
 good good weak foot good special 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.330
 So four stars do not move 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.290
 expensive and now in the storm is watching us 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.459
 have in the storm 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.140
 usain bolt but the type I like 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.850
 not alone in front of goal one against one 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.040
 play so there is really bad 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.470
 but every flank on him goes somehow 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.630
 purely 76 buys because it somehow 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.140
 a little but do so he is a good one 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.239
 player 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.340
 Now I just enjoy the gates 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.170
 I could shoot with this spot 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.170
 Just recommend it and skin in 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.510
 bring pigs 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.170
 with the plan 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.170
 the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.729
 so far 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.610
 I think 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.610
 sippel 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.410
 doing 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.020
 Simon 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.590
 Max 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.850
 b 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.990
 because I'm great 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.420
 red 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.990
 in the disco 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.990
 Without a body cash register of the secure 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.080
 the best 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 Rostock 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.740
 series 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.309
 california 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.610
 and you 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.610
 Yes 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.570
 36
