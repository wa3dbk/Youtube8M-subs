like<00:00:12.000> this

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.880 

it's<00:00:16.780> give<00:00:16.930> me<00:00:17.020> a<00:00:17.080> second

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.740 
follow the all you see is the camera
moving<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.070> not<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.370> actual<00:00:46.460> view<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.629> what

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
moving but not the actual view so what

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.780 
moving but not the actual view so what
you<00:00:47.840> do<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.140> do<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.290> is<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.949> right<00:00:49.220> click<00:00:49.610> on

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
you do to do that is you right click on

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.020 
you do to do that is you right click on
perspective<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.660> go<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.840> cameras<00:00:51.320> camera<00:00:51.590> one

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
perspective and go to cameras camera one

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.990 
perspective and go to cameras camera one
as<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.570> can<00:00:53.629> see<00:00:53.870> now<00:00:54.410> it<00:00:54.650> moves<00:00:54.860> but<00:00:55.580> we<00:00:55.820> want

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
as you can see now it moves but we want

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.549 
as you can see now it moves but we want
to<00:00:56.059> say<00:00:56.239> actually<00:00:56.449> where<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.930> background<00:00:57.350> is

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
to say actually where the background is

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.540 
to say actually where the background is
so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.930 
so
if<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.770> right<00:01:01.770> click<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.190> smooth<00:01:02.489> highlights

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
if we right click on smooth highlights

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
if we right click on smooth highlights
go<00:01:03.329> down<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> viewport<00:01:03.840> background<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.650> show

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
go down to viewport background and show

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
go down to viewport background and show
background<00:01:05.780> now<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.170> follows<00:01:08.810> okay<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
background now it follows okay if you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.050 
background now it follows okay if you
want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.840> create<00:01:13.409> shadows<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> look

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
want to create shadows to make it look

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.410 
want to create shadows to make it look
more<00:01:15.119> realistic<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> create<00:01:17.970> tab

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
more realistic you go to the create tab

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.710 
more realistic you go to the create tab
and<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.950> geometry<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.300> create<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and then then geometry you can create a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.230 
and then then geometry you can create a
plane<00:01:21.960> behind<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.470> text<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> line<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
plane behind the text and line up as you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
plane behind the text and line up as you
see<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:25.460> make<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> text<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:28.250> in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
see there make sure that the text is in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.730 
see there make sure that the text is in
line<00:01:30.119> or<00:01:30.450> above<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:32.390> points<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:33.990> look

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
line or above the points so it will look

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.770 
line or above the points so it will look
exactly<00:01:36.740> on<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.220> look<00:01:37.880> as<00:01:38.000> if<00:01:38.119> it's<00:01:38.270> attached<00:01:38.600> to

and<00:05:53.440> assume<00:05:54.440> this<00:05:54.650> frame<00:05:54.919> rate<00:05:55.160> you<00:05:55.310> change<00:05:55.550> to

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
and assume this frame rate you change to

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.070 
and assume this frame rate you change to
59.94

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.719 

now<00:05:59.650> as<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:01.150> can<00:06:01.389> see<00:06:01.599> it<00:06:01.900> sticks<00:06:02.439> to<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.250> wall

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.410 

like<00:06:07.330> this

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.750 

now<00:06:11.670> if<00:06:12.670> you<00:06:12.880> want<00:06:13.090> to<00:06:13.150> make<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.480> realistic<00:06:14.760> you

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
now if you want to make it realistic you

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.280 
now if you want to make it realistic you
can<00:06:16.170> add<00:06:17.170> some<00:06:17.500> effects<00:06:17.860> to<00:06:18.100> it<00:06:18.250> I<00:06:18.400> have<00:06:18.550> added

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
can add some effects to it I have added

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.680 
can add some effects to it I have added
a<00:06:20.290> tint<00:06:21.040> just<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.610> get<00:06:21.730> it<00:06:21.850> sort<00:06:22.150> of<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.450> same

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
a tint just to get it sort of the same

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.160 
a tint just to get it sort of the same
color<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:23.320> shadows<00:06:23.950> that<00:06:24.340> I<00:06:25.030> had<00:06:25.480> on<00:06:25.510> didn't

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
color the shadows that I had on didn't

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.430 
color the shadows that I had on didn't
work<00:06:27.130> as<00:06:27.340> well<00:06:27.370> as<00:06:27.910> well<00:06:28.570> as<00:06:28.750> i<00:06:28.930> would<00:06:29.260> have

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
work as well as well as i would have

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.590 
work as well as well as i would have
liked<00:06:29.740> as<00:06:30.040> i<00:06:30.190> was<00:06:30.280> working<00:06:30.640> to<00:06:30.850> a<00:06:30.880> time<00:06:31.270> limit

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
liked as i was working to a time limit

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.310 
liked as i was working to a time limit
so<00:06:32.070> um<00:06:33.070> you<00:06:33.880> can<00:06:33.910> also<00:06:34.150> add<00:06:34.480> curves<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.140> this

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
so um you can also add curves to this

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.290 
so um you can also add curves to this
you<00:06:35.740> cannot<00:06:35.950> do<00:06:36.220> this<00:06:36.250> by<00:06:36.520> going<00:06:36.670> to<00:06:36.910> effect

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
you cannot do this by going to effect

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.430 
you cannot do this by going to effect
color<00:06:37.630> correction<00:06:37.690> and<00:06:38.200> curves<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:40.170> then<00:06:41.170> add

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
color correction and curves and then add

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.100 
color correction and curves and then add
in

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
in

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.020 
in
a<00:06:43.200> basic<00:06:43.770> color<00:06:44.190> curve

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.540 

but<00:06:47.600> you<00:06:47.720> can<00:06:47.900> spend

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
but you can spend

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.559 
but you can spend
more<00:06:50.180> time<00:06:50.450> on<00:06:50.630> that<00:06:50.660> if<00:06:50.930> you<00:06:51.080> want

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.709 

right<00:06:54.169> I<00:06:54.439> think<00:06:54.889> that's<00:06:55.069> it<00:06:55.249> so<00:06:55.639> thank<00:06:56.539> you<00:06:56.659> for
