00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 ni hao and welcome again to the show 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.629
 tour and today we are going to show you the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.919
 special functions of movement that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.919
 bring the 900 leave 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.260
 to activate special functions what 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.810
 what you have to do first is the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.390
 adjustment is like always going down here 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.039
 where he puts gestors somatÃ©n sensor and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.320
 and here you have them as you can see there are four and 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.090
 we will explain them one by one first 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.370
 what you have is the multi fleet lo 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.110
 activate first you can enter one and 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.300
 see what he does as you can see 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
 has a little introduction 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300
 basically what it does is that if you 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.579
 a call arrives you turn around the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.350
 phone and hang the phone hangs the 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.699
 automatically call without 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.699
 that you have to hit no button 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.550
 then we have the smart the smart answer 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.870
 the smart anses what you want to say is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.430
 that when you receive a call if 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.160
 you want to take it all you have to 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.900
 to do is put the phone next to the 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.440
 ear and the phone connects the call 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.440
 automatically 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.979
 then we have the second smart answer 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.810
 the second smart answer works like the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 previous but instead of putting the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 phone the leave what you do is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.380
 shake it as you see here in the photo 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.770
 and finally we have the intelligent 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.850
 switching the interim switch on what 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.930
 it means that if you take a call 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.280
 well and while you're talking it looks like 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.920
 the star phone you put it like this 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.210
 activate hands-free automatically without 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.210
 that you have to touch any button 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.900
 another interesting application the 900's 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.620
 what you will find here is the double touch 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.569
 in the house button to 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.760
 turn off the screen now that it's 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.150
 activated as you see 22 times 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.400
 and it goes off well up here the show 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.290
