00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
put my one dollar tree cashier into a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350 
put my one dollar tree cashier into a
hyperventilation<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.879> she<00:00:39.030> said<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.329> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
hyperventilation because she said that I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.619 
hyperventilation because she said that I
couldn't<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.960> um<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.550> coupon<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.030> two<00:00:42.210> items

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
couldn't use um one coupon on two items

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.920 
couldn't use um one coupon on two items
but<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.620> she<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:45.120> grappling

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
but I think she really was grappling

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.270 
but I think she really was grappling
with<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.320> understanding<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.039> can't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
with the understanding that you can't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.220 
with the understanding that you can't
use<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> cope<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:48.239> coupons<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.079> item<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
use to cope two coupons on one item and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.610 
use to cope two coupons on one item and
possibly<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.680> anyway<00:00:53.120> she<00:00:54.260> didn't<00:00:55.260> really

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
possibly but anyway she didn't really

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
possibly but anyway she didn't really
put<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.190> fight<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.370> explained<00:00:57.090> her<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
put up much of a fight I explained her I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
put up much of a fight I explained her I
think<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.170> i<00:00:58.320> told<00:00:58.500> her<00:00:58.620> i<00:00:58.710> think<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
think that what i told her i think that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.610 
think that what i told her i think that
was<00:00:59.219> essentially<00:00:59.489> wipe<00:00:59.760> out<00:00:59.910> most<00:01:00.090> coupons

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
was essentially wipe out most coupons

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.689 
was essentially wipe out most coupons
and<00:01:01.620> she<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.070> concerned<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and she was also concerned because the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.280 
and she was also concerned because the
dollar<00:01:02.879> amount<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.480> greater<00:01:03.809> than<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> dollar

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
dollar amount was greater than a dollar

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.130 
dollar amount was greater than a dollar
and<00:01:04.710> i<00:01:05.339> asked<00:01:05.909> her<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:06.930> two

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and i asked her but if it's over two

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.590 
and i asked her but if it's over two
items<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.799> isn't<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.460> 75<00:01:09.180> cents<00:01:09.479> off

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
items then isn't really 75 cents off

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
items then isn't really 75 cents off
each<00:01:09.780> item<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> store<00:01:11.640> manager<00:01:11.850> who

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
each item and then the store manager who

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
each item and then the store manager who
was<00:01:12.210> beside<00:01:12.659> her<00:01:12.900> checking<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> lap

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.160 
was beside her checking some you lap
knotted<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.490> goes<00:01:14.700> yeah<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.780> that's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
knotted and goes yeah I think that's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.240 
knotted and goes yeah I think that's
right<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.710> sure<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.040> keep<00:01:17.189> changing

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
but either way they should do it you can

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.740 
but either way they should do it you can
do<00:02:58.859> multiple<00:02:59.010> transactions<00:02:59.909> if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.659> know
