00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 well 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.890
 so today as you can the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.500
 see I come to introduce you to my 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.670
 storage for my shoes so I 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.710
 go right now to put a picture 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.710
 what it was before 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 here they go so you can see this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.250
 that it gives now 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 so in fact I still have a lot of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 shoes I find so there is that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.120
 my winter shoes so I wanted 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 but introduce you my little do not 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.449
 a trick but it's my new 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 shoe storage so in fact I 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.070
 bought what you can see there it's 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.900
 a piece of furniture that I found on the site of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 the dread so anyway I you 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.489
 put in the info bar the link for 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.920
 all those that could 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.179
 to interest 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.859
 so I'm showing you this more closely 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.409
 so here I put it actually I put 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.600
 two so I'm going to approach that one on 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.000
 saw I put two in knowing that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 above I have my wardrobe with some 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 clothing 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.049
 so I did not stack them but you 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.990
 can stack them it's done to see 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.460
 you have the little ones how to say the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.520
 small notches to be able to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.920
 stacking is also he is lengthening so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.549
 you have people rails the choice on the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.020
 propulsion 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.360
 you have rails and squeezes and the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 so slide me there they are 20 of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.970
 minus the one who basically is at the maximum 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.539
 no because I do not put boots but 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.759
 he's getting bigger 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.190
 here and you have two small floors 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.799
 with a boat is higher than 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.899
 the other so you can store your 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.830
 shoes so I tidied here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.299
 all my shoes whatever 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.530
 wait for it in the process of my camcorder 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.240
 is loading everything I remove my 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 homeland that's for power so I put 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.649
 all my shoes going through the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.270
 sneakers 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.240
 the pumps etc 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 the little boots I put in front of the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.560
 voyeurs even under jimmy and ballerinas that 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.090
 I have stacked and put 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.100
 behind the shoes that I put 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.950
 maybe a little less often 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.440
 so you know that when you have 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.920
 like me a little cupboard 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.019
 it's still first cleaner, 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.190
 a little more practical to find the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.709
 second pair I confess I was not 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.290
 at all to organize for my 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.079
 shoes with regards to the boots 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.230
 so here I have two pairs of boots so 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.950
 I have one 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.629
 like this here just to show you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.639
 my little tip that is not mine 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.129
 by the way and so I have one 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.650
 second one that's a bit more a little bit more 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.249
 flat actually just for her to hold 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.139
 standing 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.639
 I put as shown in 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.519
 bottles of water so that's a 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.659
 empty counter bottle in the other 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.670
 I think there are evian bottles 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.219
 so depending on the size of your 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.079
 two boots and that actually allows you to 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.060
 to let them stand up without 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.359
 that it is damaged too much so me 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.609
 mine 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.200
 before I do that I see them 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.739
 have they taken the fold and that's when 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.959
 same damage 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.790
 so see that there behind at the bottom 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.930
 you have some cowboy boots 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.340
 where I put bottles of the perrier 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.500
 so that allows them to stay 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.819
 standing 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.889
 this is one of you on youtube who 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.090
 had spun me the trick and it's a very 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.549
 very good tip 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.409
 so what can I do you 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.540
 to say more about listening and I think that 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.359
 that's all we went around 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.569
 so do not hesitate to put me in video 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.180
 comment how you are doing 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.400
 store your shoes if you have 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.900
 how a small closet 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.639
 I personally I do not put 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.049
 in the boxes because first thing 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.519
 it puffs me up to keep the boxes and 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.359
 take out boxes every morning 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.290
 I have no time and beyond that I 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.419
 think it's still a lot 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.470
 more convenient to see everything and not that 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.060
 takes up a lot less space 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.000
 so here I say again you can 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.849
 stack where the totals and side by side 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.109
 for those who have a small 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.459
 cupboard you can put two rounds 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.590
 could put flip flops could not all 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.239
 m here are the girls but listen I you 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.129
 do very very big kisses 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.509
 not to post in video commentary worth 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.709
 shoe storage if you ever have 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.599
 made a video of this type 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.229
 I hope this video has helped you 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:24.030
 and will have eventually inspired you to 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 tidy up your shoes and I make you 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.229
 very big kisses ciao
