00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
I think it looks pretty good I mean the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.940 
I think it looks pretty good I mean the
car<00:00:03.090> we<00:00:03.540> didn't<00:00:03.899> have<00:00:04.080> any<00:00:04.470> problems

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
car we didn't have any problems

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.490 
car we didn't have any problems
regarding<00:00:05.100> no<00:00:05.910> major<00:00:06.359> problems<00:00:06.899> regarding<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
regarding no major problems regarding a

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.459 
regarding no major problems regarding a
reliability<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.639> did<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> lot<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.120> laps

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
reliability so we did a lot of laps

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.629 
reliability so we did a lot of laps
unfortunately<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.650> were<00:00:10.800> always<00:00:10.950> not<00:00:11.250> variant

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
unfortunately we were always not variant

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.190 
unfortunately we were always not variant
we<00:00:11.759> were<00:00:11.910> not<00:00:12.059> always<00:00:12.240> very<00:00:12.570> gifted<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
we were not always very gifted with the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320 
we were not always very gifted with the
weather<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.070> had<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> lot<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.429> rain<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
weather so we had a lot of rain which is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.930 
weather so we had a lot of rain which is
good<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.780> us<00:00:15.839> drivers<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.010> especially<00:00:17.520> when

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
good for us drivers but especially when

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.599 
good for us drivers but especially when
you<00:00:18.119> try<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.750> improve<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> car<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:20.430> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
you try to improve the car and first of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
you try to improve the car and first of
all<00:00:20.699> get<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.029> know<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.390> car<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
all get to know your car it's not that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
all get to know your car it's not that
good<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.789> conditions<00:00:24.420> change<00:00:24.960> all<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
good because conditions change all the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.950 
good because conditions change all the
time<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.240> hopefully<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.480> more<00:00:27.750> dry

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
time so hopefully we have more dry

well handling the the new regulations is
quite<00:00:45.570> straightforward<00:00:46.020> obviously<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> lose

you you you use the test the time on
track<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.180> yourself<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> car<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.289> much

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
track for yourself for the car as much

fortunately<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> card<00:00:55.699> characteristic<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
fortunately the card characteristic the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
fortunately the card characteristic the
car<00:00:57.030> balance<00:00:57.360> hasn't<00:00:57.660> changed<00:00:57.899> much<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
car balance hasn't changed much so that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.950 
car balance hasn't changed much so that
makes<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.789> easier<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.359> sure<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
makes it a bit easier but for sure you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.200 
makes it a bit easier but for sure you
know<00:01:01.559> running<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> biggest<00:01:02.730> change<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
know running that the biggest change is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
know running that the biggest change is
we<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.870> allowed<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> refuel<00:01:04.589> anymore<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
we are not allowed to refuel anymore so

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.950 
we are not allowed to refuel anymore so
running<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.640> high<00:01:05.790> fuel<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> beginning<00:01:06.840> of

running on high fuel at the beginning of

running on high fuel at the beginning of
the<00:01:07.080> race<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:08.100> crucial<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.479> crucial

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the race is crucial it would be crucial

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.670 
the race is crucial it would be crucial
to<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:11.030> deal<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:13.170> maintain

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
to you know deal or you know maintain

to you know deal or you know maintain
your<00:01:13.890> tires<00:01:14.159> alive<00:01:15.020> trying<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.680> look

your tires alive trying to you know look

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.539 
your tires alive trying to you know look
after<00:01:17.130> them<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.840> couple<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> changes<00:01:20.310> coming

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
after them so a couple of changes coming

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.380 
after them so a couple of changes coming
up<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.030> us<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> drivers<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.240> think<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
up for us for the drivers but I think we

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
up for us for the drivers but I think we
we<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.930> manage<00:01:25.580> well<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we will all manage well I think from the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
we will all manage well I think from the
outside<00:01:27.680> expectations<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.860> very<00:01:28.979> high<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
outside expectations are very high and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
outside expectations are very high and
we<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> favourites<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.409> this

we are one of the favourites for this
year<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.539

did<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> past<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> new<00:01:55.890> generation

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549

for<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.820> young<00:01:56.939> generation<00:01:57.079> obviously

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
for the young generation obviously

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
for the young generation obviously
worked<00:01:58.439> pretty<00:01:58.680> well<00:01:58.920> we've<00:01:59.610> got<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> lot<00:02:00.000> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
worked pretty well we've got a lot of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080 
worked pretty well we've got a lot of
serious<00:02:00.829> competitive<00:02:01.829> junior<00:02:02.670> formula

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
serious competitive junior formula

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.780 
serious competitive junior formula
series<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.899> karting<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> right

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
series also in karting we on the right

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.469 
series also in karting we on the right
right<00:02:06.240> way<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.429> yes<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.970> still<00:02:09.450> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
right way but yes I think still a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
right way but yes I think still a
surprise<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.379> many<00:02:10.590> German

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
surprise to have that many German

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.130 
surprise to have that many German
drivers<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> other<00:02:12.480> hand<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
drivers but on the other hand I think is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.370 
drivers but on the other hand I think is
too

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
too

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.230 
too
