00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
a little bit and this tree is really

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.599 
a little bit and this tree is really
simple<00:03:38.959> because<00:03:39.319> it's<00:03:39.680> not<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:40.069> much<00:03:40.099> stuff

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
simple because it's not that much stuff

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.740 
simple because it's not that much stuff
to<00:03:40.639> do<00:03:40.970> with<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:43.389> they<00:03:44.389> are<00:03:44.540> also

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750
