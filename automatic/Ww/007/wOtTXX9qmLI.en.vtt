still so dr. Griffin gave it to you in
that<00:00:23.220> show<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> premise<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.019> quite

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that show but the premise is quite

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.759 
that show but the premise is quite
simple<00:00:26.300> take<00:00:27.300> something<00:00:27.869> designed<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.710> nature

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
simple take something designed by nature

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.609 
simple take something designed by nature
and<00:00:29.429> reprogram<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.480> make<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> work<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and reprogram it to make it work for the
