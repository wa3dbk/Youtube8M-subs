00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.070
 personal speech of the computer technology that today 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.529
 not you here the teacher and did 8 321 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.029
 teacher and with cost benefit 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.240
 excellent partner who has been 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
 enough in my business and I liked 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.849
 show a little about him to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.420
 You 're a CPU that has it's 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 part in fact of 3.2 ghz them and will 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 up to 4 gb networks at maximum in the turbo nÃ© 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.820
 It's got 16 mega cash all I got 88 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 processing cores and here in 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.219
 own box was for a peek 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.230
 that it reaches up to 5 Giga-Hertz, right? 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.170
 if you overclock all 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.930
 amd processors are unlocked 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 for you you can overclock 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.010
 obviously that in these cases of commendation 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.210
 that you use and 11 a cooler is a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 and then a small 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
 you can work in a good way 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.540
 I have a good margin for 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.799
 overclock and always take too much 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.830
 careful with the characteristics of the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.200
 equipment will not exceed a 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.070
 which he can quickly offer here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.070
 It's going to open and show you. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.080
 what god i do not know 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.870
 and open the box at the same time. 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.340
 time in one of the easier tasks 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.970
 but are basically here it comes with the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.140
 Ecuador 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.010
 conventional baby I think it 's 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.110
 Quiet, no, no, you do not need to 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.220
 more than this for you to work with 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.960
 he in stock 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.570
 He's coming here, you can see. 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.700
 in the video it already comes with the folder 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.090
 His technique is you do not need to touch 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.130
 in her, with her eyes, not only did she 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.990
 no problem here the processor 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.360
 you can even get to the camera that the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.900
 little model he comes with a sticker where 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.640
 you can put your cabinet to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:29.590
 very good 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.470
 here he will take advantage of several 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.890
 languages here 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.120
 the conventional hand is not for dogs 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.090
 in nothing else 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.250
 the flex line processors 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.760
 in this case here is a processor with a 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.000
 end and whenever you look at risks 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 and served if you get on a one processor 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.890
 here with the end he is actually a 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.880
 processor that has a low power consumption. 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.500
 energy 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.800
 so in this case here you can put 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.740
 a board that goes up to 95 watts you already 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:12.360
 can put this fex 8 321 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:16.260
 already the 8 350 it already needs 125 base 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.430
 so not in this case here you can can 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.070
 put a plaque of the simplest gives 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:28.200
 three more online support you will 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.090
 able to use profits there without 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.410
 no problem 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.720
 the team, I just hope they have not 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.730
 liked in the neighbor's 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.030
 in the simple video fast drawing and only for 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.680
 really show how the processor 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.239
 come here in our hand or if you 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.540
 buy from a company that sells 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.640
 only processors or parts in the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.120
 In general, it will arrive at your house. 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.920
 with 11 with those with this peripheral 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.920
 serve strong personal hug
