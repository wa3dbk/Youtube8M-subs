and a very good friend one of the things
that<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.160> shooting<00:00:47.550> mountain<00:00:48.030> biking

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that I see with shooting mountain biking

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
that I see with shooting mountain biking
frequently<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.379> pictures<00:00:49.620> where<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
frequently is I see pictures where it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.319 
frequently is I see pictures where it
just<00:00:50.190> looks<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.520> they're<00:00:50.789> standing<00:00:51.270> still

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
just looks like they're standing still

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
just looks like they're standing still
and<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> question<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> how<00:00:53.129> do<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.340> create

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and the question is how do you create

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
and the question is how do you create
the<00:00:54.239> feeling<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> speed<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> mountain<00:00:56.340> bike

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the feeling of speed on a mountain bike

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
the feeling of speed on a mountain bike
so<00:00:56.699> we're<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.879> look<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> picture<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.840> high

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so we're gonna look at a picture at high

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.319 
so we're gonna look at a picture at high
shutter<00:00:58.770> speed<00:00:58.969> captured<00:00:59.969> at<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> five

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
shutter speed captured at a five

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
shutter speed captured at a five
hundredth<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.930> second<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.530> thousandth<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hundredth of a second or a thousandth of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
hundredth of a second or a thousandth of
a<00:01:02.129> second<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.239> we're<00:01:03.390> gonna<00:01:03.510> slow<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
a second and then we're gonna slow it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
a second and then we're gonna slow it
way<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.350> into<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.369> fifteenth<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.240> second

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
way down into that fifteenth of a second

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
way down into that fifteenth of a second
eighth<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> second<00:01:07.770> range<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
eighth of a second range and really do a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
eighth of a second range and really do a
pan<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.170> Jake<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.619> he<00:01:10.710> passes<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.760> slowing

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
pan with Jake as he passes it by slowing

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.520 
pan with Jake as he passes it by slowing
the<00:01:12.330> shutter<00:01:12.570> speed<00:01:12.840> down<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> really

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the shutter speed down we can really

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
the shutter speed down we can really
create<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.159> illusion<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.670> speed<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
create the illusion of speed and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
create the illusion of speed and
oftentimes<00:01:15.990> that's<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.650> challenge<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
oftentimes that's the challenge you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
oftentimes that's the challenge you
don't<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> freeze<00:01:17.880> your<00:01:18.150> athlete<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
don't want to freeze your athlete you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
don't want to freeze your athlete you
really<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> create<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.040> illusion<00:01:20.280> or

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
really want to create this illusion or

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
really want to create this illusion or
this<00:01:21.000> feeling<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.479> they're<00:01:21.630> moving<00:01:21.869> fast<00:01:22.409> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
this feeling if they're moving fast so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
this feeling if they're moving fast so
I'm<00:01:23.549> gonna<00:01:23.759> show<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.270> looks<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.659> at

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm gonna show you what it looks like at

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.330 
I'm gonna show you what it looks like at
five<00:01:25.080> hundredths<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.619> second<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.159> gonna

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
five hundredths of a second I'm gonna

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
five hundredths of a second I'm gonna
stop<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> action<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.930> fact<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.350> it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
stop the action and in fact I think it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
stop the action and in fact I think it's
a<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.799> boring<00:01:29.100> photo<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.210> at

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
a pretty boring photo when you see it at

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.520 
a pretty boring photo when you see it at
five<00:01:30.479> hundredth<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> second<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
five hundredth of a second or a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
five hundredth of a second or a
thousandth<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> second<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.119> slow<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
thousandth of a second then we slow the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
thousandth of a second then we slow the
shutter<00:01:33.780> speed<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.380> down<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.939> from

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
shutter speed way down and then from

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
shutter speed way down and then from
there<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.409> adjust<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.920> aperture<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
there I'm going to adjust my aperture so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179 
there I'm going to adjust my aperture so
that<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.290> concerned<00:01:40.439> about<00:01:40.740> depth<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that I'm not concerned about depth of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
that I'm not concerned about depth of
field<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.670> mind<00:01:41.880> being<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.299> f11<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:42.930> f-16

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
field I don't mind being at f11 or f-16

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
field I don't mind being at f11 or f-16
or<00:01:43.530> f/8<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> reality<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.479> going

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
or f/8 because the reality is I'm going

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
or f/8 because the reality is I'm going
to<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.750> moving<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.380> camera<00:01:46.619> while<00:01:47.369> Jake<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to be moving the camera while Jake is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670 
to be moving the camera while Jake is
actually<00:01:48.390> ripping<00:01:48.659> past<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> mountain

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually ripping past me on the mountain

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.010 
actually ripping past me on the mountain
bike<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:50.820> trying<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.420> consistently

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
bike and I'm trying to do consistently

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.530 
bike and I'm trying to do consistently
I'm<00:01:52.439> trying<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> move<00:01:52.920> my<00:01:53.130> camera<00:01:53.479> fluidly<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I'm trying to move my camera fluidly and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780 
I'm trying to move my camera fluidly and
in<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> same<00:01:55.049> plane<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.560> Jake<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.520> want

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
in the same plane as Jake so that I want

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
in the same plane as Jake so that I want
to<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.060> capture<00:01:57.360> something<00:01:58.020> sharp

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
to really capture something sharp
