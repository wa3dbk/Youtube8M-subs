I<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.390> oil<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.489> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I know there's oil in it and I think I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920 
I know there's oil in it and I think I
put<00:00:41.850> air<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.989> tighten<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> suspension

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
