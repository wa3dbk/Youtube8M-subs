with<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.889> with<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> hair<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
with it with the hair and the the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.840 
with it with the hair and the the
brushing<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.950> putting<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> up<00:03:26.639> because

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
brushing and the putting it up because

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.000 
brushing and the putting it up because
of<00:03:26.940> working<00:03:27.299> out<00:03:27.420> but<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.109> does<00:03:28.350> shed<00:03:28.709> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
of working out but it does shed and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.220 
of working out but it does shed and
every<00:03:29.160> time<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.370> do<00:03:29.430> brush<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.970> hair<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.720> have

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
every time I do brush the hair I do have

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.379 
every time I do brush the hair I do have
a<00:03:31.560> little<00:03:31.769> bit<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.730> know<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> small

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
a little bit of you know like a small

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.879 
a little bit of you know like a small
clump<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:33.840> my<00:03:33.959> hand<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.470> end<00:03:34.650> up<00:03:34.739> throwing

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
clump in my hand and I end up throwing

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.120 
clump in my hand and I end up throwing
away<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.670> sort<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.940> disappointing<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.130> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
away so sort of disappointing but it is

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.099 
away so sort of disappointing but it is
what<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.239> other<00:03:39.420> thing<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
what it is and then the other thing I

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.800 
what it is and then the other thing I
noticed<00:03:40.680> too<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.459> since<00:03:42.180> there<00:03:42.660> was<00:03:42.780> a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
noticed too is that since there was a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.449 
noticed too is that since there was a
period<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.139> time<00:03:43.350> where<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.560> was<00:03:43.799> using<00:03:44.010> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
period of time where I was using a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.120 
period of time where I was using a
heating<00:03:45.090> product<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.019> hair<00:03:46.260> everyday<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
heating product on the hair everyday and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.660 
heating product on the hair everyday and
towards<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.530> end<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.889> day<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.130> want<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.519> say

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
towards the end of the day I want to say

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.670 
towards the end of the day I want to say
it<00:03:50.940> will<00:03:51.120> start<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.450> look<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.230> little<00:03:52.380> bit

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
it will start to look a little bit

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.650 
it will start to look a little bit
frayed<00:03:53.100> back<00:03:53.310> here<00:03:53.519> not<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.150> was<00:03:54.299> getting

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
frayed back here not that it was getting

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.030 
frayed back here not that it was getting
clumpy<00:03:55.349> but<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.190> was<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.370> getting<00:03:57.859> like<00:03:58.859> I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
clumpy but it was just getting like I

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.009 
clumpy but it was just getting like I
don't<00:03:59.400> know<00:03:59.489> it<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.209> looked<00:04:00.569> like<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.690> needed<00:04:00.959> to

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
don't know it it looked like I needed to

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.259 
don't know it it looked like I needed to
put<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> brush<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.769> my<00:04:01.859> hair<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.819> was<00:04:02.970> also

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
put a brush to my hair and that was also

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.430 
put a brush to my hair and that was also
another<00:04:03.389> disappointing<00:04:03.930> fact<00:04:04.139> because<00:04:04.349> it

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
another disappointing fact because it

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.660 
another disappointing fact because it
made<00:04:04.560> me<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> little<00:04:04.769> bit<00:04:04.980> more<00:04:05.160> self-conscious

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
made me a little bit more self-conscious

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.670 
made me a little bit more self-conscious
every<00:04:06.180> time<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:07.019> I<00:04:07.079> would<00:04:07.290> curl<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.650> hair

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
every time that I would curl my hair

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.740 
every time that I would curl my hair
because<00:04:08.010> back<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.519> would<00:04:08.700> get<00:04:08.880> into<00:04:09.269> like<00:04:09.690> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
because back here would get into like a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.140 
because back here would get into like a
little<00:04:10.049> poof<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:11.010> i<00:04:11.280> would<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:11.910> brush<00:04:12.120> it

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
little poof but i would just brush it

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.900 
little poof but i would just brush it
and<00:04:12.329> would<00:04:12.510> go<00:04:12.630> back<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.870> normal<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.349> then<00:04:13.590> i

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
and would go back to normal and then i

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.250 
and would go back to normal and then i
realized<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:15.030> if<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.480> continued<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.959> put<00:04:16.169> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
realized that if I continued to put the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.170 
realized that if I continued to put the
heat<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:16.859> going<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.099> continue<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.970> wear

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
heat is just going to continue to wear

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.580 
heat is just going to continue to wear
down<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.419> hair<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:18.930> that's<00:04:19.139> why<00:04:19.289> I've<00:04:19.470> been

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
down the hair so that's why I've been

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.979 
down the hair so that's why I've been
rocking<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.519> for<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.030> past<00:04:21.060> two

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
rocking it like this for the past two

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.920 
rocking it like this for the past two
and<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.169> half<00:04:22.320> weeks<00:04:22.349> because<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.039> noticed<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
and a half weeks because I noticed that

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.160 
and a half weeks because I noticed that
when<00:04:24.930> I

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
when I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.170 
when I
was<00:04:25.290> keeping<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.770> like<00:04:25.980> this<00:04:26.220> I<00:04:26.490> wasn't

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
was keeping it like this I wasn't

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.250 
was keeping it like this I wasn't
getting<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.390> problem<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> would

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
getting that problem so I would

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.560 
getting that problem so I would
recommend<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.950> if<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:30.030> purchase<00:04:30.270> this
