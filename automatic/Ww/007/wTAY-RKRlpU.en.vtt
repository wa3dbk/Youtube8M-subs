00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.259 
week did you catch that one it was a
monumental<00:03:26.380> task<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.010> our<00:03:27.430> Dave<00:03:27.670> Malkoff<00:03:27.880> is

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
monumental task and our Dave Malkoff is

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.509 
monumental task and our Dave Malkoff is
right<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.690> middle<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.109> investigation

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
right in the middle of the investigation

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.180 
right in the middle of the investigation
talking<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.700> troopers<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.780> victims

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
talking to the troopers and the victims

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.410 
talking to the troopers and the victims
posse<00:03:33.190> our<00:03:33.310> time<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.730> lab<00:03:33.910> with<00:03:34.150> Carl

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
posse our time in the lab with Carl

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.030 
posse our time in the lab with Carl
Parker<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.079> we<00:03:35.170> are<00:03:35.260> talking<00:03:35.650> about<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
Parker and we are talking about the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680 
Parker and we are talking about the
drought<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.609> California<00:03:36.639> and<00:03:37.389> something<00:03:37.630> I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
drought in California and something I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.599 
drought in California and something I
think<00:03:37.750> might<00:03:38.350> surprise<00:03:38.590> people<00:03:38.709> at<00:03:39.190> home<00:03:39.370> is

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
think might surprise people at home is

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.309 
think might surprise people at home is
that<00:03:39.639> they<00:03:39.970> don't<00:03:40.389> just<00:03:40.450> rely<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:40.810> rain<00:03:41.290> I

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
that they don't just rely on rain I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.840 
that they don't just rely on rain I
think<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.799> obvious<00:03:42.220> choice<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.670> always

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
think the obvious choice is to always

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.789 
think the obvious choice is to always
say<00:03:42.940> oh<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.420> want<00:03:43.450> rain<00:03:43.780> yeah<00:03:44.170> they<00:03:44.380> also<00:03:44.500> want

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
say oh we want rain yeah they also want

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.039 
say oh we want rain yeah they also want
snow<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.519> snow<00:03:45.819> is<00:03:46.060> really<00:03:46.480> critical<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.900> mean

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
snow the snow is really critical I mean

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.720 
snow the snow is really critical I mean
that's<00:03:47.260> really<00:03:47.680> where<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.950> water<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.280> coming

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
that's really where the water is coming

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.309 
that's really where the water is coming
from<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.030> snow<00:03:49.239> builds<00:03:49.630> up<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.959> mountains

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
from the snow builds up on the mountains

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.020 
from the snow builds up on the mountains
during<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.650> course<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.069> winter<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.459> then

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
during the course of the winter and then

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.729 
during the course of the winter and then
it<00:03:52.120> runs<00:03:52.299> off<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.690> into<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.930> reservoirs<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
it runs off and into the reservoirs and

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.710 
it runs off and into the reservoirs and
the<00:03:53.799> reservoirs<00:03:54.639> are<00:03:54.850> doing<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.269> little<00:03:55.480> bit

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
the reservoirs are doing a little bit

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.509 
the reservoirs are doing a little bit
better<00:03:55.959> since<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.590> early<00:03:56.889> part<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.220> December

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
better since the early part of December

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.020 
better since the early part of December
right<00:03:57.910> now<00:03:58.060> 42<00:03:58.720> percent<00:03:59.139> owned<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.730> March

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
right now 42 percent owned and in March

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.750 
right now 42 percent owned and in March
April<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.630> May<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:02.319> is<00:04:02.530> really<00:04:03.100> really<00:04:03.310> hard

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
April and May it is really really hard

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.390 
April and May it is really really hard
to<00:04:04.209> predict<00:04:04.569> El<00:04:04.780> Nino<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.380> scientists<00:04:06.220> don't

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
to predict El Nino and scientists don't

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.910 
to predict El Nino and scientists don't
actually<00:04:06.760> know<00:04:07.180> exactly<00:04:07.510> why<00:04:08.139> that<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.410> it's<00:04:08.799> a

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
actually know exactly why that is it's a

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.069 
actually know exactly why that is it's a
mystery<00:04:09.370> at<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:10.030> point<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:10.480> we<00:04:10.630> thought<00:04:10.840> that

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
mystery at this point so we thought that

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.990 
mystery at this point so we thought that
there<00:04:11.170> might<00:04:11.350> be<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.500> strong<00:04:11.769> El<00:04:11.950> Nino<00:04:12.250> hasn't

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
there might be a strong El Nino hasn't

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.399 
there might be a strong El Nino hasn't
been<00:04:13.120> anything<00:04:13.329> like<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.689> and<00:04:14.080> at<00:04:14.170> this

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
been anything like that and at this

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.409 
been anything like that and at this
point<00:04:14.739> what<00:04:15.459> we're<00:04:15.610> looking<00:04:15.879> at<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.120> literally

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
point what we're looking at is literally

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.039 
point what we're looking at is literally
has<00:04:16.599> finally<00:04:16.930> started<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.260> burn<00:04:17.709> off

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
has finally started to burn off

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.599 
has finally started to burn off
in<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.259> Central<00:04:18.560> Valley<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:18.829> California<00:04:18.859> yeah

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
in the Central Valley in California yeah

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.039 
in the Central Valley in California yeah
not<00:04:19.819> what<00:04:19.940> they<00:04:20.060> want<00:04:20.269> when<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.509> fall<00:04:20.690> kind<00:04:20.959> of

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
not what they want when the fall kind of

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.230 
not what they want when the fall kind of
takes<00:04:21.229> center<00:04:21.500> stage<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:22.159> where<00:04:22.460> they<00:04:22.759> would

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
takes center stage to where they would

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.210 
takes center stage to where they would
hope<00:04:23.419> that<00:04:23.659> your<00:04:23.840> eyes<00:04:24.110> would<00:04:24.349> be<00:04:24.470> brought<00:04:25.039> to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
hope that your eyes would be brought to

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.700 
hope that your eyes would be brought to
all<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> show<00:04:25.639> yeah<00:04:25.879> exactly<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:27.409> here's

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
all the show yeah exactly and so here's

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.499 
all the show yeah exactly and so here's
the<00:04:27.860> next<00:04:27.979> storm<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.340> we're<00:04:28.580> watching<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.090> big

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
the next storm that we're watching a big

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.420 
the next storm that we're watching a big
feature<00:04:29.750> that's<00:04:30.050> well<00:04:30.740> offshore

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
feature that's well offshore

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.100 
feature that's well offshore
maybe<00:04:31.759> interior<00:04:32.300> parts<00:04:32.569> of<00:04:32.629> the<00:04:32.690> Northeast

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
maybe interior parts of the Northeast

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.899 
maybe interior parts of the Northeast
but<00:04:33.349> that<00:04:33.530> might<00:04:33.770> be<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.099> only<00:04:34.220> exception<00:04:34.879> a

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:34.909 
but that might be the only exception a

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.279 
but that might be the only exception a
little<00:04:35.120> bit<00:04:35.270> of<00:04:35.360> Vermont<00:04:35.629> New<00:04:35.750> Hampshire<00:04:35.870> and

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
little bit of Vermont New Hampshire and

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.480 
little bit of Vermont New Hampshire and
Maine<00:04:36.349> that's<00:04:36.590> probably<00:04:36.830> gonna<00:04:36.949> be<00:04:37.039> about<00:04:37.310> it

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
Maine that's probably gonna be about it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.950 
Maine that's probably gonna be about it
all<00:04:37.669> right<00:04:37.759> Carl<00:04:38.060> thank<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.509> much<00:04:38.720> Dave
