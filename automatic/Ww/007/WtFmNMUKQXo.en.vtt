more agile dodges around in combat

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
more agile dodges around in combat
rather<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:13.860> block<00:01:14.240> run<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.510> down<00:01:15.570> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
rather than block run up and down so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.170 
rather than block run up and down so
verticals<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> lot<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.890> earth<00:01:17.759> levels

verticals have a lot more earth levels
have<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> lot<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.509> vertical<00:01:18.900> design<00:01:19.200> because

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
have a lot more vertical design because

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
have a lot more vertical design because
it's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> lot<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> spider-like<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it's a lot more a spider-like and the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
it's a lot more a spider-like and the
way<00:01:21.299> he<00:01:21.450> moves<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.900> very<00:01:22.680> different<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.100> more

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
way he moves so very different for more

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
way he moves so very different for more
what<00:01:24.150> else<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:24.900> forward<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
what else do we have to look forward to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
what else do we have to look forward to
in<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.220> far<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.610> weapons<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
in this game as far as like weapons and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
in this game as far as like weapons and
this<00:01:27.630> stuff<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> schemers<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.070> good<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this stuff that schemers really good so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
this stuff that schemers really good so
i<00:01:29.939> guess<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.049> first

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
i guess like you know in the first

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.770 
i guess like you know in the first
Darksiders<00:01:32.270> character<00:01:33.270> progression<00:01:33.420> was

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
linear where you know at the same point

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.940 
linear where you know at the same point
you'd<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.120> new<00:01:36.390> weapons<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.020> by

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you'd get the same new weapons and by

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.870 
you'd get the same new weapons and by
the<00:01:38.010> end<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.370> pretty<00:01:38.550> much<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.760> same

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the end we have pretty much the same

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
the end we have pretty much the same
characters<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.480> darksiders<00:01:40.170> 2<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.770> a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
like so there they start basic but then

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.280

you feed weapons into them and then they
go<00:02:04.440> up<00:02:04.560> levels<00:02:04.890> themselves<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.820> kind<00:02:06.000> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
go up levels themselves and you kind of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.640 
go up levels themselves and you kind of
design<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.450> weapon<00:02:06.720> as<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> increase<00:02:07.229> the
