right here guys

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.160 
right here guys
so<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> always<00:02:26.460> use<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.030> bigger<00:02:27.390> needle<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.020> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
so I always use a bigger needle and this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.890 
so I always use a bigger needle and this
is<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.640> two<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.790> three<00:02:30.060> needle<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.630> want<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
is a two to three needle and I want to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.250 
is a two to three needle and I want to
use<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.620> area<00:02:32.070> because<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
use that in this area because the the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.100 
use that in this area because the the
lace<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.770> double<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.820> using<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.360> smaller

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
lace is double so if you using a smaller

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.780 
lace is double so if you using a smaller
needle<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.620> easy<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.280> needle<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
needle it's easy for your needle to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.330 
needle it's easy for your needle to
break<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.170> only<00:02:40.470> time<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:41.040> go

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
break so that's the only time that I go

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.340 
break so that's the only time that I go
and<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.580> pick<00:02:41.820> up<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.270> go<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> big<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.080> bigger

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
and I pick up a bit go a big a bigger

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.260 
and I pick up a bit go a big a bigger
needle<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.980> start<00:02:44.550> working<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.120> when
