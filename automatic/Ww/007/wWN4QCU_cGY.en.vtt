everyone<00:00:11.460> how's<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.179> today<00:00:12.900> I'm<00:00:13.200> going

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
everyone how's it going today I'm going

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.379 
everyone how's it going today I'm going
to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.740> over<00:00:14.040> reading<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:14.969> enemy's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to be going over reading an enemy's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.230 
to be going over reading an enemy's
energy<00:00:16.020> state<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.500> well<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:17.160> reading<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:18.060> his

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
energy state as well as reading into his

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
energy state as well as reading into his
maneuvers<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.980> gain<00:00:20.189> quite<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
maneuvers because you can gain quite a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.759 
maneuvers because you can gain quite a
bit<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.970> valuable<00:00:21.420> information<00:00:21.510> by<00:00:22.500> just

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
bit of valuable information by just

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.700 
bit of valuable information by just
watching<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.400> enemy<00:00:23.670> does<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> I'm

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
watching what your enemy does and I'm

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.849 
watching what your enemy does and I'm
going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.130> using<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.670> next<00:00:27.119> fight<00:00:27.859> between

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
going to be using the next fight between

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.190 
going to be using the next fight between
myself<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.060> my<00:00:30.240> buckle<00:00:30.869> Wulf<00:00:31.050> 190<00:00:31.679> d<00:00:32.070> 13<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.200> a

myself in my buckle Wulf 190 d 13 and a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.819 
myself in my buckle Wulf 190 d 13 and a
lavochkin<00:00:34.739> la<00:00:35.460> 7<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.540> 20<00:00:38.300> now<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:40.559> pulling

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
lavochkin la 7 be 20 now as I'm pulling

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.709 
lavochkin la 7 be 20 now as I'm pulling
out<00:00:41.160> over<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> top<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.540> climb<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.170> noticed

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
out over the top of my climb I noticed

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.850 
out over the top of my climb I noticed
aircraft<00:00:45.719> getting<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> triple-a<00:00:46.800> below<00:00:47.550> me<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
aircraft getting a triple-a below me and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
aircraft getting a triple-a below me and
when<00:00:49.860> i<00:00:49.890> zoom<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.210> definitely

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
when i zoom in I can see it's definitely

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.860 
when i zoom in I can see it's definitely
an<00:00:52.199> enemy<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> he's<00:00:53.360> coming<00:00:54.360> towards<00:00:54.809> me

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
an enemy and he's coming towards me

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
an enemy and he's coming towards me
quite<00:00:55.140> quickly<00:00:55.379> although<00:00:55.739> he<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.010> climbing

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
quite quickly although he is climbing

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.200 
quite quickly although he is climbing
slightly<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> coming<00:00:59.699> out<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
slightly as I was just coming out of a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.959 
slightly as I was just coming out of a
dive<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:01.500> built<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.920> enough<00:01:02.250> airspeed<00:01:02.550> where

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
dive I've built up enough airspeed where

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.570 
dive I've built up enough airspeed where
I<00:01:03.000> feel<00:01:03.359> somewhat<00:01:03.870> confident<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.189> i<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.309> go

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
I feel somewhat confident that i can go

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.219 
I feel somewhat confident that i can go
vertical<00:01:06.030> again<00:01:06.210> without<00:01:06.390> him<00:01:06.689> being<00:01:06.869> able<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
vertical again without him being able to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.760 
vertical again without him being able to
follow<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.790> now<00:01:08.790> watching<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.540> does<00:01:09.840> he

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
follow me now watching what he does he

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
follow me now watching what he does he
goes<00:01:10.799> into<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> left-hand<00:01:12.299> turn<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.400> does<00:01:14.400> not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
goes into a left-hand turn and does not

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640 
goes into a left-hand turn and does not
try<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> follow<00:01:15.210> me<00:01:15.420> into<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.659> climb<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
try to follow me into my climb so that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
try to follow me into my climb so that
tells<00:01:16.890> me<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.670> basically<00:01:17.880> he<00:01:18.540> realizes<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
tells me but basically he realizes that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.679 
tells me but basically he realizes that
he<00:01:19.560> cannot<00:01:20.040> follow<00:01:20.790> me<00:01:21.090> into<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> climb

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
he cannot follow me into the climb

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.679 
he cannot follow me into the climb
because<00:01:21.960> his<00:01:22.320> energy<00:01:22.799> state<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.330> inferior<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
because his energy state is inferior to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.470 
because his energy state is inferior to
mine

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.560 

and<00:01:27.800> instead<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.860> being<00:01:29.420> aggressive<00:01:30.420> he

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and instead of being aggressive he

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.770 
and instead of being aggressive he
actually<00:01:30.750> dives<00:01:31.440> away<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.450> allows<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
actually dives away and allows me to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
actually dives away and allows me to
build<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.080> even<00:01:34.230> more<00:01:34.560> energy<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.310> dye

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
build up even more energy in the dye

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.200 
build up even more energy in the dye
following<00:01:36.030> him<00:01:37.340> now<00:01:38.340> those<00:01:38.550> first<00:01:38.970> few

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
following him now those first few

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.030 
following him now those first few
seconds<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> fight<00:01:40.050> were<00:01:40.230> incredibly

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
seconds of the fight were incredibly

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.770 
seconds of the fight were incredibly
critical<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.850> even<00:01:42.300> though<00:01:42.390> he<00:01:42.540> came

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
critical because even though he came

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
critical because even though he came
into<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.500> fight<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.190> slight

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
into the fight with a slight

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.150 
into the fight with a slight
disadvantage<00:01:45.230> his<00:01:46.230> aircraft<00:01:46.560> does<00:01:46.920> perform

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
disadvantage his aircraft does perform

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.550 
disadvantage his aircraft does perform
better<00:01:48.000> than<00:01:48.270> mine<00:01:48.510> at<00:01:48.750> these<00:01:48.900> low<00:01:49.050> altitudes

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
better than mine at these low altitudes

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.240 
better than mine at these low altitudes
in<00:01:49.830> most<00:01:50.610> regards<00:01:51.260> that<00:01:52.260> being<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> case<00:01:52.890> he

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
in most regards that being the case he

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.010 
in most regards that being the case he
would<00:01:53.400> have<00:01:53.550> wanted<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:54.120> try<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.660> me<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
would have wanted to try to get me to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.110 
would have wanted to try to get me to
burn<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.730> my<00:01:56.940> energy<00:01:56.970> as<00:01:57.660> he<00:01:58.110> could

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
burn as much of my energy as he could

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.480 
burn as much of my energy as he could
when<00:02:00.120> he<00:02:00.450> went<00:02:00.840> defensive<00:02:01.440> there<00:02:01.680> after<00:02:02.460> my

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
when he went defensive there after my

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.320 
when he went defensive there after my
initial<00:02:03.000> zoom<00:02:03.510> climb<00:02:03.890> he<00:02:04.890> pretty<00:02:05.100> much

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
initial zoom climb he pretty much

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.109 
initial zoom climb he pretty much
solidified<00:02:06.330> my<00:02:07.050> advantage<00:02:07.740> over<00:02:07.920> him<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.430> put

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
solidified my advantage over him and put

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.450 
solidified my advantage over him and put
himself<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.899> very<00:02:10.170> bad<00:02:10.380> position<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.160> try

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
himself in a very bad position to try

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.310 
himself in a very bad position to try
and<00:02:11.730> regain<00:02:12.450> any<00:02:12.780> sort<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> advantage<00:02:14.100> over<00:02:14.430> me

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
and regain any sort of advantage over me

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.310 
and regain any sort of advantage over me
so<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:16.500> all<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.070> do<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> not<00:02:19.020> make

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
so now all I have to do is and not make

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.560 
so now all I have to do is and not make
any<00:02:19.500> mistakes<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.790> fight<00:02:21.030> should<00:02:21.270> be<00:02:21.330> in

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
any mistakes and this fight should be in

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.550 
any mistakes and this fight should be in
the<00:02:21.720> bag<00:02:23.210> his<00:02:24.210> energy<00:02:24.690> state<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.050> much<00:02:25.260> lower

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the bag his energy state is much lower

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.220 
the bag his energy state is much lower
than<00:02:25.680> mine<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.600> I'm<00:02:27.600> able<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.020> just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
than mine and I'm able to just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
than mine and I'm able to just
continuously<00:02:29.160> boom<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.640> zoom<00:02:29.670> him<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.240> he

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
continuously boom and zoom him and he

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.620 
continuously boom and zoom him and he
can<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.810> very<00:02:31.020> little<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
can do very little now as the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.480 
can do very little now as the
performance<00:02:33.630> gap<00:02:34.230> between<00:02:34.590> our<00:02:34.920> two<00:02:35.040> aircraft

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
performance gap between our two aircraft

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.370 
performance gap between our two aircraft
at<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.000> moment<00:02:36.330> will<00:02:37.320> not<00:02:37.560> play<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> factor<00:02:39.380> so

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
at the moment will not play a factor so

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.910 
at the moment will not play a factor so
now<00:02:40.560> my<00:02:40.800> goal<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.810> keep<00:02:42.810> attacking<00:02:43.320> him<00:02:43.739> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
now my goal is to keep attacking him and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.190 
now my goal is to keep attacking him and
not<00:02:44.459> allow<00:02:44.850> him<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.390> gain<00:02:45.630> any<00:02:45.930> sort<00:02:46.140> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
not allow him to gain any sort of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.820 
not allow him to gain any sort of
foothold<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.920> he<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.130> use<00:02:47.160> over<00:02:47.340> me

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
foothold that he can use over me

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.260 
foothold that he can use over me
although<00:02:49.830> he<00:02:50.010> does<00:02:50.190> make<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.550> easy<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
although he does make it easy here and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.410 
although he does make it easy here and
pull<00:02:51.570> straight<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.290> front<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.560> my<00:02:52.650> guns

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
pull straight up in front of my guns

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.729 
pull straight up in front of my guns
allowing<00:02:54.420> me<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.630> put<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> nice<00:02:55.080> hole<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.620> his

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
allowing me to put a nice hole into his

allowing me to put a nice hole into his
left-wing<00:02:56.100> route<00:02:56.720> basically<00:02:57.720> rendering<00:02:58.500> his

left-wing route basically rendering his

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
aircraft useless in a fight now as he

and his only option now is to try and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
and I was able to finish him off quite

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.000 
and I was able to finish him off quite
quickly<00:03:31.290> anyways<00:03:32.290> guys<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.739> hope<00:03:32.859> you<00:03:32.920> enjoyed
