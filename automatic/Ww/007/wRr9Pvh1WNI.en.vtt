00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
with the DW link rear suspension we

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.130 
with the DW link rear suspension we
built<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.400> original<00:00:29.880> mojo<00:00:30.150> back<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.510> 2005

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
built that original mojo back in 2005

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
built that original mojo back in 2005
and<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.920> moved<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> mojo<00:00:32.759> SL

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and from there we moved to the mojo SL

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
and from there we moved to the mojo SL
which<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.840> lighter<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.530> little

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
which is a little lighter and a little

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.850 
which is a little lighter and a little
stiffer<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.120> moved<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.500> different

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
stiffer and then we moved to a different

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700 
stiffer and then we moved to a different
category<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> Mojo<00:00:39.000> HD<00:00:39.480> 160<00:00:40.170> ml<00:00:40.350> travel

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
category with the Mojo HD 160 ml travel

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.830 
category with the Mojo HD 160 ml travel
bike<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.670> bike<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> six<00:00:42.600> point

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
bike and that bike was about a six point

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.040 
bike and that bike was about a six point
three<00:00:42.899> pound<00:00:43.350> frame<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.360> very<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:45.690> stiff

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
three pound frame and very very stiff

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.380 
three pound frame and very very stiff
and<00:00:46.260> very<00:00:46.320> strong<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:47.969> we've<00:00:48.180> taken

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and very strong so now we've taken

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.760 
and very strong so now we've taken
everything<00:00:48.750> we've<00:00:48.989> learned<00:00:49.110> from<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> Mojo

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
everything we've learned from the Mojo

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.900 
everything we've learned from the Mojo
HD<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.730> thrown<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.510> into<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> Mojo<00:00:52.680> SLR<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
HD and thrown that into the Mojo SLR the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.479 
HD and thrown that into the Mojo SLR the
Mojo<00:00:54.210> SLR<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.690> identical<00:00:55.469> geometry<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
Mojo SLR is identical geometry to the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.930 
Mojo SLR is identical geometry to the
Mojo<00:00:56.850> SL<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> DW<00:00:58.800> link<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.250> 140

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
Mojo SL so it's a DW link with 140

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
Mojo SL so it's a DW link with 140
millimeters<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.539> rear<00:01:00.690> wheel<00:01:00.840> travel<00:01:01.320> 69<00:01:01.859> head

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
millimeters of rear wheel travel 69 head

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.130 
millimeters of rear wheel travel 69 head
angle<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.699> some<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> things<00:01:03.899> we've

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
angle and some of the things we've

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
angle and some of the things we've
changed<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> SLR<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.880> we've<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
changed up on the SLR or we've got a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
changed up on the SLR or we've got a
taper<00:01:07.020> steer<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.460> run<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.700> angle<00:01:09.000> set

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
taper steer so you can run an angle set

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
taper steer so you can run an angle set
on<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> kick<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> head

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
on here if you want to kick the head

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.080 
on here if you want to kick the head
angle<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> 67<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> half<00:01:12.840> say<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.090> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
angle down to 67 and a half say and you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.719 
angle down to 67 and a half say and you
can<00:01:15.240> run<00:01:15.420> 140<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.140> 150<00:01:16.530> millimeter<00:01:17.100> fork<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
can run 140 or 150 millimeter fork on it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.670 
can run 140 or 150 millimeter fork on it
if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.150> either<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> 160

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
if you want either way if you go to 160

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.679 
if you want either way if you go to 160
probably<00:01:20.009> move<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> mojo<00:01:20.850> HD<00:01:21.270> that'd<00:01:21.630> be

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
probably move over to mojo HD that'd be

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.469 
probably move over to mojo HD that'd be
the<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:21.960> way<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:23.820> an<00:01:23.970> entirely

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the right way to go we use an entirely

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.740 
the right way to go we use an entirely
new<00:01:24.960> molding<00:01:25.500> technology<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.790> bike<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
new molding technology in this bike and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.620 
new molding technology in this bike and
picture<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.470> cutaway<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
picture a little little cutaway here and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.100 
picture a little little cutaway here and
the<00:01:33.630> technology<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:35.390> pretty<00:01:36.390> advanced<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the technology is pretty advanced it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.050 
the technology is pretty advanced it
allows<00:01:37.350> us<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> build<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.040> super<00:01:38.490> super<00:01:38.820> clean

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
allows us to build a super super clean

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660 
allows us to build a super super clean
layup<00:01:39.470> results<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.710> stiffer<00:01:41.159> stronger

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
layup results in a stiffer stronger

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.760 
layup results in a stiffer stronger
lighter<00:01:41.880> bike<00:01:42.150> basically<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> our

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
lighter bike basically if you go to our

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
lighter bike basically if you go to our
website<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.610> details<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.899> how<00:01:46.170> we

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
website you can see details on on how we

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.139 
website you can see details on on how we
do<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.030> pretty

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
do it but it's a it's a pretty

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.080 
do it but it's a it's a pretty
interesting<00:01:48.420> process<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.189> builds<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
interesting process and and it builds a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
interesting process and and it builds a
superior<00:01:52.079> frame<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.560> think

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
superior frame we think

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.219 
superior frame we think
let's<00:01:54.710> see<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:55.640> addition<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.570> tapered

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
let's see so in addition to the tapered

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.240 
let's see so in addition to the tapered
head<00:01:57.350> tube<00:01:57.580> we've<00:01:58.580> also<00:01:58.760> got<00:01:59.120> oh<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.979> got<00:02:01.100> some

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
head tube we've also got oh you got some

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.680 
head tube we've also got oh you got some
riffraff<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.880> through<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.120> booth<00:02:02.270> here

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
riffraff going through the booth here

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.500 
riffraff going through the booth here
that<00:02:03.170> was<00:02:03.290> brian<00:02:03.500> lopes<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.950> got<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.790> BB<00:02:05.030> 92

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
that was brian lopes you got the BB 92

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.330 
that was brian lopes you got the BB 92
bottom<00:02:05.810> bracket<00:02:06.229> lends<00:02:06.560> itself<00:02:06.860> really<00:02:06.979> well

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
bottom bracket lends itself really well

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.999 
bottom bracket lends itself really well
to<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.850> molding<00:02:08.149> technology<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.959> we<00:02:09.080> use<00:02:09.289> to

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
to the molding technology that we use to

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.300 
to the molding technology that we use to
lay<00:02:10.160> these<00:02:10.369> up<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:10.880> once<00:02:11.180> again<00:02:12.310> stiffer

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
lay these up but once again stiffer

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.000 
lay these up but once again stiffer
stronger<00:02:14.030> lighter<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:15.140> those<00:02:15.800> are<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
stronger lighter that's those are the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.290 
stronger lighter that's those are the
three<00:02:16.220> things<00:02:16.400> we're<00:02:16.640> always<00:02:16.790> looking<00:02:17.030> to

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
three things we're always looking to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.270 
three things we're always looking to
improve<00:02:17.660> one<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.410> other<00:02:18.560> features<00:02:18.950> that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
improve one of the other features that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.880 
improve one of the other features that
the<00:02:19.580> bike<00:02:20.090> has<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.600> addition<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> BB<00:02:21.410> 92

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the bike has in addition to the BB 92

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.430 
the bike has in addition to the BB 92
press<00:02:22.160> fit<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.240> direct<00:02:23.540> mount<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.990> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
press fit is the direct mount and the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.320 
press fit is the direct mount and the
nice<00:02:24.620> thing<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.280> it's<00:02:25.730> much<00:02:26.030> much

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
nice thing about that is it's much much

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.699 
nice thing about that is it's much much
more<00:02:26.390> compatible<00:02:26.900> with<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> 2<00:02:27.530> by

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
more compatible with the 2 by

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.550 
more compatible with the 2 by
drivetrains<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:29.239> are<00:02:29.360> coming<00:02:29.630> out<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.200> 2

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
drivetrains that are coming out now so 2

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.830 
drivetrains that are coming out now so 2
by<00:02:30.709> n3<00:02:30.890> buyer<00:02:31.340> can<00:02:31.790> all<00:02:31.970> be<00:02:32.120> very<00:02:32.570> easily

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
by n3 buyer can all be very easily

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.110 
by n3 buyer can all be very easily
accommodated<00:02:33.560> with<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> direct<00:02:34.220> mount<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
accommodated with a direct mount the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.460 
accommodated with a direct mount the
other<00:02:35.150> thing<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:35.959> with<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.230> is

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
other thing you can do with this is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.790 
other thing you can do with this is
there's<00:02:36.680> actually<00:02:36.890> an<00:02:37.280> upper<00:02:38.050> upper<00:02:39.050> chain

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
there's actually an upper upper chain

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.210 
there's actually an upper upper chain
guide<00:02:40.010> or<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.910> know<00:02:41.320> yeah<00:02:42.350> chain<00:02:42.890> guide<00:02:43.100> that

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
guide or you know yeah chain guide that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.530 
guide or you know yeah chain guide that
you<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.340> run<00:02:43.550> just<00:02:43.790> for<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> top<00:02:44.150> half<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
you can run just for the top half that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.080 
you can run just for the top half that
MRP<00:02:45.110> makes<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.709> there's<00:02:46.400> some<00:02:46.640> pretty

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
MRP makes and there's some pretty

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.820 
MRP makes and there's some pretty
interesting<00:02:47.360> new<00:02:47.720> derailleur<00:02:48.140> technology

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
interesting new derailleur technology

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.490 
interesting new derailleur technology
that<00:02:49.310> Shimano<00:02:49.790> has<00:02:50.060> come<00:02:50.269> out<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:50.500> that

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that Shimano has come out with that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.740 
that Shimano has come out with that
really<00:02:52.340> kind<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.820> eliminates<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.540> need<00:02:53.690> for

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
really kind of eliminates the need for

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.449 
really kind of eliminates the need for
the<00:02:53.989> bottom<00:02:54.290> half<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> chain<00:02:54.890> guides<00:02:55.190> it's

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the bottom half of the chain guides it's

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.670 
the bottom half of the chain guides it's
called<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> shadow<00:02:56.030> plus<00:02:56.390> Shimano<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.530> tell

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
called the shadow plus Shimano can tell

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.470 
called the shadow plus Shimano can tell
you<00:02:57.799> all<00:02:57.920> about<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.330> other

you all about that one of the other

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.789 
you all about that one of the other
things<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.110> SLR<00:03:00.620> has<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:01.930> 142<00:03:02.930> maxcel

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
things that the SLR has is 142 maxcel

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.580 
things that the SLR has is 142 maxcel
through<00:03:04.070> axle<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:05.150> once<00:03:05.540> again<00:03:05.690> stiffer

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
through axle so once again stiffer

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.370 
through axle so once again stiffer
stronger<00:03:07.130> lighter<00:03:07.480> one<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.690> one<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.320> the

stronger lighter one of the one of the
things<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.160> should<00:03:10.579> also<00:03:10.730> point<00:03:10.880> out<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.860> these

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
things I should also point out is these

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.250 
things I should also point out is these
are<00:03:13.209> 160<00:03:14.209> ml<00:03:14.390> post<00:03:14.690> mount<00:03:14.959> integrated<00:03:15.799> carbon

are 160 ml post mount integrated carbon

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.690 
are 160 ml post mount integrated carbon
into<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.290> drop<00:03:18.560> out<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:19.250> instead<00:03:19.549> of<00:03:19.640> a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
into the drop out so it's instead of a

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.720 
into the drop out so it's instead of a
drop<00:03:19.940> out<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.110> piece<00:03:21.380> now<00:03:21.620> which<00:03:22.549> is

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
drop out it's all one piece now which is

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.520 
drop out it's all one piece now which is
slightly<00:03:23.000> different<00:03:23.269> than<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:24.079> way<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.350> used

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
slightly different than the way we used

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.880 
slightly different than the way we used
to<00:03:24.680> do<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:25.060> we're<00:03:26.060> using<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.570> new<00:03:27.110> lower<00:03:27.380> link<00:03:27.680> on

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
to do it we're using a new lower link on

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.759 
to do it we're using a new lower link on
here<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.310> latest<00:03:28.640> revision<00:03:29.329> this<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.410> what<00:03:30.680> we

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
here the latest revision this is what we

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.220 
here the latest revision this is what we
call<00:03:30.950> Rev<00:03:31.130> 14<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:31.970> it's<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.600> actually<00:03:32.989> ends<00:03:33.170> up

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
call Rev 14 so it's it actually ends up

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.449 
call Rev 14 so it's it actually ends up
being<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.560> hundred<00:03:33.769> percent<00:03:33.980> stiffer

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
being a hundred percent stiffer

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.550 
being a hundred percent stiffer

torsionally than the first iteration of
the<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.760> link<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.299> did<00:03:38.540> at<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.079> very

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
the the link that we did at the very

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.069 
the the link that we did at the very
beginning<00:03:39.530> back<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:39.920> 2005<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.690> we've<00:03:41.930> been

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
beginning back in 2005 so we've been

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.009 
beginning back in 2005 so we've been
making<00:03:42.260> constant<00:03:42.890> improvements<00:03:43.459> on<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.550 
Mojo of the Mojo SL and that bike has
gotten<00:03:49.459> stiffer<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.120> better<00:03:50.660> all<00:03:50.900> along<00:03:51.230> but

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
gotten stiffer and better all along but

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.530 
gotten stiffer and better all along but
we've<00:03:52.370> pretty<00:03:52.549> much<00:03:52.640> reached<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.150> end<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
we've pretty much reached the end of the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.140 
we've pretty much reached the end of the
rope<00:03:53.720> with<00:03:53.989> what<00:03:54.320> we<00:03:54.440> could<00:03:54.650> do<00:03:54.860> with<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.940> Mojo

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
rope with what we could do with the Mojo

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.930 
rope with what we could do with the Mojo
SL<00:03:57.010> because<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.160> didn't<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.579> tapered

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
SL because it didn't have the tapered

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.870 
SL because it didn't have the tapered
head<00:03:59.060> tube<00:03:59.120> which<00:03:59.780> lets<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.680> let<00:04:01.609> you<00:04:01.760> have

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
head tube which lets you let you have

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.030 
head tube which lets you let you have
use<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.329> much<00:04:02.570> much<00:04:02.870> stiffer<00:04:03.169> tapered<00:04:03.769> steer

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
use the much much stiffer tapered steer

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.300 
use the much much stiffer tapered steer
Forks<00:04:04.570> also<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.109> BB<00:04:06.350> 90<00:04:06.650> Q<00:04:06.859> as<00:04:06.949> I<00:04:07.070> meant

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
Forks also the the BB 90 Q as I meant

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.300 
Forks also the the BB 90 Q as I meant
and<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.060> Maxell<00:04:08.900> thru-axle<00:04:09.260> all<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:10.190> those

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and the Maxell thru-axle all of those

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.610 
and the Maxell thru-axle all of those
things<00:04:10.670> are<00:04:11.390> real<00:04:11.870> game<00:04:12.140> changers

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
things are real game changers

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.589 
things are real game changers
technologically<00:04:13.459> as<00:04:13.610> far<00:04:13.849> as<00:04:14.000> building<00:04:14.540> a

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
technologically as far as building a

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.009 
technologically as far as building a
bike<00:04:15.050> that<00:04:15.319> that<00:04:15.709> performs<00:04:16.310> even<00:04:16.639> better<00:04:17.019> one

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
bike that that performs even better one

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.390 
bike that that performs even better one
of<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.169> other<00:04:18.320> things<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.709> we<00:04:18.889> did<00:04:19.100> is<00:04:19.280> we

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
of the other things that we did is we

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.870 
of the other things that we did is we
kind<00:04:19.579> of<00:04:19.730> took<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:21.380> volume<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.490> Mojo

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
kind of took the the volume of the Mojo

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.540 
kind of took the the volume of the Mojo
HD<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.720> put<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.919> front<00:04:25.130> half<00:04:25.400> of

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
HD and put that in the front half of

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.210 
HD and put that in the front half of
this<00:04:25.639> bike<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.630> what<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.380> mean<00:04:27.620> by<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:27.800> is

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
this bike and what I mean by that is

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.580 
this bike and what I mean by that is
that's<00:04:28.370> how<00:04:28.580> how<00:04:28.850> big<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.270> tubes<00:04:29.510> are<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.080> how

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
that's how how big the tubes are and how

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.610 
that's how how big the tubes are and how
stiff<00:04:30.980> they<00:04:31.160> are<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.389> Mojo<00:04:32.690> SLR<00:04:33.200> ends<00:04:33.500> up

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
stiff they are so the Mojo SLR ends up

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.400 
stiff they are so the Mojo SLR ends up
being<00:04:33.740> about<00:04:33.950> 90%<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.910> stiff<00:04:35.210> overall<00:04:35.690> 80<00:04:36.200> to

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
being about 90% of stiff overall 80 to

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.520 
being about 90% of stiff overall 80 to
90%<00:04:36.680> in<00:04:37.190> every<00:04:37.460> measurement<00:04:37.790> as<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.780> Mojo<00:04:39.110> HD

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
90% in every measurement as the Mojo HD

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.580 
90% in every measurement as the Mojo HD
but<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:39.979> lighter<00:04:40.340> than<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.940> Mojo<00:04:41.300> SL<00:04:41.750> so

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
but it's lighter than the Mojo SL so

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.680 
but it's lighter than the Mojo SL so
that's<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.979> quick<00:04:43.160> tour<00:04:43.419> there's<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.510> few

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
that's the quick tour there's a few

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.210 
that's the quick tour there's a few
other<00:04:44.840> things<00:04:44.900> like<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.500> Kashima<00:04:45.919> code<00:04:46.130> it

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
other things like the Kashima code it

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.480 
other things like the Kashima code it
really<00:04:46.520> makes<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.990> DW<00:04:48.830> length<00:04:49.040> perform

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
really makes the the DW length perform

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.900 
really makes the the DW length perform
beautifully<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:52.010> stuff<00:04:52.310> that<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:52.790> know
