00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
drop shot them not only is it response

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.140 
drop shot them not only is it response
time<00:06:02.490> from<00:06:02.940> from<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.680> internet<00:06:05.220> to<00:06:05.669> respond

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
time from from the internet to respond

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.450 
time from from the internet to respond
to<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.630> move<00:06:06.870> but<00:06:07.590> it's<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.860> human<00:06:08.280> response

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
to that move but it's a human response

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.990 
to that move but it's a human response
to<00:06:09.060> respond<00:06:09.720> to<00:06:09.870> that<00:06:09.960> move<00:06:10.200> so<00:06:11.010> this<00:06:11.460> you

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
to respond to that move so this you

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.230 
to respond to that move so this you
basically<00:06:12.780> cut<00:06:13.139> that<00:06:13.349> time<00:06:13.620> and<00:06:13.889> it<00:06:13.950> like<00:06:14.240> 1/4

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
basically cut that time and it like 1/4

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.140 
basically cut that time and it like 1/4
of<00:06:15.450> a<00:06:15.510> second<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.220> if<00:06:17.220> you're<00:06:17.490> hitting<00:06:17.820> them

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150
