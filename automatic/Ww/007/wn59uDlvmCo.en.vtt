and now we're going to power up the
Virtual<00:00:15.080> Boy<00:00:15.200> Virtual<00:00:15.950> Boy<00:00:16.039> has<00:00:16.309> three<00:00:16.580> major

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
Virtual Boy Virtual Boy has three major

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.300 
Virtual Boy Virtual Boy has three major
components<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.690> stand<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.619> head<00:00:18.800> unit<00:00:19.010> and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
components to stand the head unit and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.490 
components to stand the head unit and
the<00:00:19.400> controller<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.420> stand<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:20.869> packed<00:00:21.109> flat

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
the controller the stand is packed flat

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.890 
the controller the stand is packed flat
so<00:00:22.099> you<00:00:22.160> want<00:00:22.340> to<00:00:22.400> take<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.670> stand<00:00:22.939> spread<00:00:23.779> it

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
so you want to take the stand spread it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.410 
so you want to take the stand spread it
open<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.439> then<00:00:24.740> set<00:00:25.130> it<00:00:25.250> firmly<00:00:25.550> on<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:25.880> table

with the feet facing forward for support
the<00:00:29.269> head<00:00:29.480> unit<00:00:29.720> has<00:00:30.289> got<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.710> be<00:00:30.859> connected

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
the head unit has got to be connected

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.220 
the head unit has got to be connected
with<00:00:31.429> a<00:00:31.609> controller<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:32.630> insert<00:00:33.080> the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
do it gently from the back so you tilt

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.360 
do it gently from the back so you tilt
it<00:00:47.149> in<00:00:47.300> first<00:00:47.629> then<00:00:48.379> push<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:48.829> down<00:00:48.859> there's<00:00:49.309> a

properly<00:01:43.070> when<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:43.640> turn<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.000> on<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.659> won't

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
properly when you turn it on you won't

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.780 
properly when you turn it on you won't
get<00:01:45.049> anything<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.280> want<00:01:46.579> to<00:01:46.640> make<00:01:46.759> sure

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
properly so when you turn it on you hear

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.719 
properly so when you turn it on you hear
it<00:01:53.530> virtual<00:01:54.530> boy<00:01:54.680> does<00:01:54.920> not<00:01:55.070> have<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.399> video
