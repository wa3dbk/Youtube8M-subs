00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.470 
they brine from snakebites here I get
asked<00:00:01.920> an<00:00:02.010> awful<00:00:02.429> lot<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.909> effects<00:00:03.300> are

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
asked an awful lot what the effects are

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.329 
asked an awful lot what the effects are
of<00:00:03.659> inbreeding<00:00:04.170> snakes<00:00:04.650> so<00:00:04.830> we're<00:00:04.950> gonna<00:00:05.040> take

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
of inbreeding snakes so we're gonna take

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.590 
of inbreeding snakes so we're gonna take
this<00:00:05.490> time<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> cover<00:00:06.390> that

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600

you're<00:00:07.500> watching<00:00:07.710> snake<00:00:08.160> bite

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550

the<00:00:21.060> two<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> talk<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.140> when

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the two things I want to talk about when

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.830 
the two things I want to talk about when
in<00:00:22.710> breeding<00:00:23.100> snakes<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.940> reasons<00:00:24.510> -<00:00:24.690> in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
in breeding snakes are the reasons - in

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.630 
in breeding snakes are the reasons - in
breed<00:00:25.050> snakes<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:25.680> effect<00:00:26.190> it<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:26.610> on

breed snakes and the effect it has on

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.940 
breed snakes and the effect it has on
snakes<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.450> do<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.930> breed<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.380> first

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
snakes when you do in breed them first

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.070 
snakes when you do in breed them first
and<00:00:29.130> foremost<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> most<00:00:29.940> common<00:00:30.480> reason<00:00:30.930> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and foremost the most common reason to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
and foremost the most common reason to
in<00:00:31.230> breed<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.530> snake<00:00:31.860> is<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.369> concentrate<00:00:33.060> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
in breed a snake is to concentrate a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.960 
in breed a snake is to concentrate a
phenotype<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> color<00:00:34.770> mutation<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.760> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
which are all early examples of

animals you had no choice but to then
take<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> normal<00:00:48.059> ball<00:00:48.270> python<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
take them to a normal ball python and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
take them to a normal ball python and
produce<00:00:49.470> normal-looking<00:00:50.160> offspring<00:00:50.910> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
produce normal-looking offspring that

that specific phenotype or color face

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400 
that specific phenotype or color face
once<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.880> raise<00:00:57.120> those<00:00:57.390> babies<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
once you raise those babies up you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
once you raise those babies up you
really<00:00:58.739> had<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.280> two<00:00:59.430> choices<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.120> could

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
really had one of two choices you could

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
really had one of two choices you could
either<00:01:00.630> breed<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> back<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.410> its<00:01:01.590> parent<00:01:02.070> or

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
either breed it back to its parent or

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
either breed it back to its parent or
you<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.820> breed<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.360> one<00:01:03.540> another

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you could breed them to one another

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.460 
you could breed them to one another
thus<00:01:04.619> inbreeding<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> snakes<00:01:06.050> very<00:01:07.050> similar

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
thus inbreeding the snakes very similar

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.870 
thus inbreeding the snakes very similar
to<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> recessive<00:01:08.040> morphs<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.670> just

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to the recessive morphs that we just

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
to the recessive morphs that we just
talked<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.300> where<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> codominant<00:01:10.530> morphs

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
talked about where the codominant morphs

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
talked about where the codominant morphs
that<00:01:10.830> came<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.280> shortly<00:01:11.640> thereafter<00:01:11.910> like<00:01:12.690> the
