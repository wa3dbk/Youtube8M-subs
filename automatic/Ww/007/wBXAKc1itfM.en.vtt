00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.980 
far is that is it a good draft is it a
deep<00:00:22.010> draft<00:00:22.310> I<00:00:22.760> think<00:00:23.119> it's<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.330> good<00:00:23.480> draft<00:00:23.750> and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
deep draft I think it's a good draft and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.630 
deep draft I think it's a good draft and
I<00:00:24.110> think<00:00:24.320> there's<00:00:24.500> obviously<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:25.520> know<00:00:25.610> a

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
I think there's obviously you know a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.609 
I think there's obviously you know a
very<00:00:26.150> talented<00:00:26.420> player<00:00:26.720> number<00:00:27.200> one<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.410> think

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
very talented player number one I think

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.589 
very talented player number one I think
there's<00:00:27.950> a<00:00:28.009> lot<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.189> guys<00:00:28.490> after<00:00:28.880> him<00:00:29.270> that<00:00:29.450> are

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
there's a lot of guys after him that are

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.460 
there's a lot of guys after him that are
kind<00:00:29.810> of<00:00:29.869> in<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.680> big<00:00:30.860> group<00:00:31.660> it's<00:00:32.660> not<00:00:33.110> a<00:00:33.140> huge

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
kind of in a big group it's not a huge

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.290 
kind of in a big group it's not a huge
difference<00:00:33.650> I<00:00:33.949> think<00:00:34.250> from<00:00:34.520> about<00:00:34.850> two<00:00:35.090> to

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
difference I think from about two to

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.720 
difference I think from about two to
five<00:00:35.510> seven<00:00:35.900> or<00:00:36.020> eight<00:00:36.309> it's<00:00:37.309> kind<00:00:37.489> of<00:00:37.580> your

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
five seven or eight it's kind of your

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.520 
five seven or eight it's kind of your
flavor<00:00:38.030> of<00:00:38.210> maybe<00:00:38.480> what<00:00:38.900> type<00:00:39.110> of<00:00:39.199> play<00:00:39.350> you

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
flavor of maybe what type of play you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.160 
flavor of maybe what type of play you
like<00:00:39.739> maybe<00:00:40.070> what<00:00:40.309> your<00:00:40.430> team<00:00:40.610> needs<00:00:41.170> how

have opportunity grab to those guys

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.340 
have opportunity grab to those guys
