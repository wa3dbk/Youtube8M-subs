00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.110
 a car has 5 gta 5 rockstar games 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.580
 new trainer material released 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.980
 and is and we are really hot 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 made on the new about open world 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 Unfortunately, we can do the thing ourselves 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.199
 do not touch yet, not yourself 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.850
 But I have to play the next best the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.010
 love thomas he has live in action 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.019
 experienced and if we are brain 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.980
 thomas prefer thomas what do you have 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.539
 seen from the game 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.090
 Yes, so maybe today I would say so 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.610
 this is not october in new york 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.040
 the first time I saw it, but me 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.100
 this time in Rockstar games 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.320
 London and brand new scenes seen and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.820
 that was very diverse so next to 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 activities I also have one 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.149
 ever been seen a -random 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.160
 Event and I just start this way 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.079
 a bit chronological with the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 activities because the first thing I do 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.120
 has seen is practically 1000 meters 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.420
 as franklin over the ground on board 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 a helicopter with the backpack on 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 the back so with the parachute and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879
 then kaida was announced for the first time 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 So you just jump out and then a lot 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.799
 beautiful through the air and even natural 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 Perfect view of the surrounding area 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.409
 I'm so wild cats this turn around 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.240
 on the ground so that he has in nature 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.000
 played by in the rural area 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 at exactly was sort certain about 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.610
 the oc 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.000
 So it was in the countryside 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.799
 just not in the city ​​and then I am 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 just sailed a bit and can 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 so you survive the whole thing 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.759
 parachute activated and next to it 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.310
 landed to take two anglers 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.939
 have looked a bit baffled 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.259
 you have one too 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.299
 seen motorcyclists so it was 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.799
 really of course not so busy in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.170
 the city but it was a lot going on times 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.520
 seen a lot and also the far-sightedness 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.340
 was really impressed and otherwise 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.890
 the nature it was during the day and me 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 Just like the idea that it all so 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.610
 Of course, it works through the light 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.200
 shadow effects what do you say to the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.270
 technology of what you have seen say 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.890
 we look at the game world 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.460
 general the thing ran on the ps3 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.619
 not true 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.119
 it was also played on ps3 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.500
 He was not allowed to play himself 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.150
 and there it was really 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
 impressive that they because 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.899
 it does not work then I do not realize that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.900
 an open world game is because it is very 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.120
 Of course , there was everything in detail 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.800
 other blurred or washed out 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.260
 textures but there was also a lot for that 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 nice textures so the total 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.530
 overall look was very good 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.210
 kantenflimmern what to me in october in new 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.850
 york got a bit stronger 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.020
 that is now the topic 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.170
 Working may not be that way anymore 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.030
 negative on also clear I in the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.710
 I have seen last years 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.600
 barely seen and there it was real 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.740
 amazed that player a few 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.630
 months before release is so also the 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.640
 degree of detail of the characters so the whole 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.490
 game world you really notice that 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.230
 rockstar games have a lot of experience in 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.300
 the last years with rage engine 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.950
 is collected and who at the jah emphasizes them 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.980
 the ps3 want to fully exploit that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 of course have heard 1000 times but 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.350
 after what I have seen now 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 I do not really disagree with them 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.310
 i think rather is in the current one 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.750
 generation not in there you have now too 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.830
 to see something different except nature 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.840
 So I'm interested in everything 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.300
 how does it feel the big one 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.400
 metropolis dlr is modeled and the 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.720
 where the whole game is playing so there 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.910
 I also saw something there 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.790
 just changed to the michael 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.760
 the boss is the trio's and there 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.620
 first a little bit through my boat 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.110
 So Hollywood ran on the walk 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.880
 of fame then stood the son of 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.959
 space ranger also existed in 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.430
 share earlier 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.160
 looks a bit like the master 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.670
 there was just such a costume one 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.860
 then you show your smartphone 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.810
 activated looks like android or ios 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.280
 easy with the whole icons then 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.320
 activates the camera and turns on 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.690
 nice photo of him then you can do it 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.360
 just upload it into the, so to speak, the 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.370
 play your own facebook so gdl has too 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.489
 one also has its own social networks 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.080
 and on the facebook verarsche of 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.549
 rock stars have already been curious 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.590
 I think we can count on a lot 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.870
 At the same time, of course, is still happy 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.080
 this interface to the social club den 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.519
 we know yes in the internet and that 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.930
 was just a scene you are one 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.820
 a little bit further down there was the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.830
 just a dynamic event, too 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.090
 Random event shown what a 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.430
 Innovation is what you call red dead 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.230
 already know redemption 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.699
 and there are various and there is 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.850
 so that you suddenly get close 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.859
 a question mark on the map recognizes and 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.850
 then you go there and in the case was 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.180
 it so that there is such a prognosis 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.680
 stand and ever success of paparazzi 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.389
 and you have to get me out of here now 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.660
 bring and then go to her 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.880
 Send cabriolet and stop it 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.130
 then just drive out of this area 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 and one is persecuted by the paparazzi 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.460
 as you know with scooters and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.650
 everywhere on the knip and the whole 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.990
 time only tells laverty how firm she is 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.690
 Feel and see her hair shit 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.520
 and that's why absolute no go is that 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.810
 now you are shot pictures too 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.660
 angry that we do not recognize them because 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.160
 is super duper Prometheus and then 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.889
 make it out of the field 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.139
 go out and a farmer since such a 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.110
 bit the mountains high in beverly 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.509
 Hills I believe and there is theirs 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.039
 chic villa and there she finds us 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.720
 suddenly also very sweet and so thanked 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.120
 again and then we invite you there 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.699
 So that was in there because that was 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.900
 Event 6 mini game six mini plays so 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.650
 I was waiting for one 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.639
 clear offer it did not come unfortunately 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.490
 I do not have much yet six 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.070
 So of course everyone else is watching live 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.639
 already accompanied in character 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.490
 venice beach 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.810
 But this component has been and will be 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.090
 but above all things, the game seems 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.289
 to be really great satire I had that 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.889
 impression that he was really fun there 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.930
 watch 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.639
 Did you have to smile anyway? 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.860
 as I'm really looking forward to it 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.060
 from all these innovations with the 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.520
 Three heroes and I am as me 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.930
 simply the most because these 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.639
 component of this tactical component 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.860
 you have in very few 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.080
 play and there is now this viral 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.639
 story with this app seal so 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.080
 this scientology fooled and so on 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.970
 unfortunately I still have the radio stations 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.770
 there is nothing I can do now too little 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.970
 say but I 'm just looking forward to it 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.580
 immerse yourself in this world of games again 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.380
 and these satirical side blows one man 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.630
 as ami probably just a bit 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.789
 he understands that as europeans but then 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.370
 He still takes a lot with him, too 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.240
 to learn and what I saw there 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.940
 I was really very 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.560
 promising and you have it 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.389
 very briefly mentioned there are three 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.380
 main characters and that's one too 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.420
 great feature in the game that you 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.800
 at any time back and forth 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.660
 can also be within the missions itself 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.950
 can choose how to play have 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.450
 you saw a new mission too 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.610
 Seen as this feature in action 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.800
 So they showed that and that 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.420
 was really impressive because of it 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.790
 So it had to say it was already 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.470
 a larger caterpillar infested 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.070
 but then they said the same 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.720
 there are much bigger things 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.810
 it was just about the fact that you go to 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.940
 cash carrier should rob and first 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.320
 sometimes you put on masks like that 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.810
 So one of them has such a chimpanzee 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.610
 mask or gorilla and the other way 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.260
 Jason Mask and the third son skeleton 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.620
 and there they emphasized that one 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.420
 practically the mission that leads to it 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.070
 the main mission as the content of 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.420
 Preparation among others has one 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.190
 vision where you yourself the masks 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.480
 choose and you should really too 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.160
 to have freedom of choice 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.380
 really can think for example 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.480
 where to get the vehicle with which he is traveling 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.030
 is then disposed of or whether from the 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.730
 back entrance or in the beginning is whether 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.690
 one proceeds as moderate or action moderately 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.520
 and there really is one 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.690
 surprising freedom of decision 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.410
 I do not have any of that yet 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.410
 seen in the sense
