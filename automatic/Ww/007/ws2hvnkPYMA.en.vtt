sunflower beyond that I'm not tree
between<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.050> sunflower<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:35.160> see

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
between that and the sunflower I can see

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.820 
between that and the sunflower I can see
a<00:04:35.340> big<00:04:35.550> bunch<00:04:35.789> of<00:04:36.030> pears<00:04:36.330> hanging<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.470> one<00:04:37.680> of

a big bunch of pears hanging in one of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.490 
a big bunch of pears hanging in one of
our<00:04:37.949> other<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:39.300> main<00:04:39.479> the<00:04:39.599> main<00:04:39.630> power<00:04:40.050> section

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
our other so main the main power section

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.010 
our other so main the main power section
is<00:04:40.650> over<00:04:40.770> there<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.449> section<00:04:42.870> of

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
is over there this is the section of

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.159 
is over there this is the section of
your<00:04:43.110> jib<00:04:43.289> nearest<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.770> Linton<00:04:44.550> called<00:04:44.759> Lane

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
your jib nearest to Linton called Lane

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.350 
your jib nearest to Linton called Lane
anyway<00:04:46.169> we<00:04:46.380> do<00:04:47.069> two<00:04:47.250> problems<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:48.030> fungal

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
anyway we do two problems with fungal

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.210 
anyway we do two problems with fungal
disease<00:04:48.660> mainly<00:04:49.169> due<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.979> inadequate

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
disease mainly due to inadequate

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.749 
disease mainly due to inadequate
spraying<00:04:51.380> earlier<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.560> year<00:04:52.770> we<00:04:53.250> ended<00:04:53.639> up

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
spraying earlier in the year we ended up

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.230 
spraying earlier in the year we ended up
with<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.300> lot<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:55.729> pairs<00:04:56.729> it<00:04:56.940> couldn't<00:04:57.180> be

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
with a lot of pairs it couldn't be

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.450 
with a lot of pairs it couldn't be
solved<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.500> we've<00:04:58.620> sold<00:04:58.800> all<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.130> pairs<00:04:59.310> we

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
solved so we've sold all the pairs we

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.879 
solved so we've sold all the pairs we
could<00:04:59.669> sell<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:01.199> others<00:05:01.470> one<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:01.800> was

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
could sell and the others one that was

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.320 
could sell and the others one that was
smart<00:05:02.160> with<00:05:02.310> scab<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:02.759> got<00:05:02.940> through<00:05:03.120> an<00:05:03.180> out

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
smart with scab I got through an out

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.100 
smart with scab I got through an out
boxes<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:03.960> them<00:05:04.729> so<00:05:05.729> I'm<00:05:06.060> going<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:07.169> add<00:05:07.759> the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
boxes of them so I'm going to add the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.140 
boxes of them so I'm going to add the
winners<00:05:10.110> longan<00:05:10.650> pair<00:05:10.919> this<00:05:11.580> by<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.849> way<00:05:11.970> is<00:05:12.120> a

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
winners longan pair this by the way is a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.930 
winners longan pair this by the way is a
pear<00:05:12.539> variety<00:05:13.110> Brandi<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:14.310> isn't<00:05:14.639> so<00:05:14.759> old

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
pear variety Brandi this isn't so old

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.600 
pear variety Brandi this isn't so old
and<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.150> is<00:05:15.210> only<00:05:15.539> about<00:05:15.919> eight<00:05:16.919> feet<00:05:17.280> tall

Kent about three four years ago and as
you<00:05:44.460> can<00:05:44.610> see<00:05:44.669> I've<00:05:45.659> cleft<00:05:46.020> grafted<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.800> no<00:05:47.729> now

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
you can see I've cleft grafted it no now

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.580 
you can see I've cleft grafted it no now
I<00:05:47.969> am<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.419> subtle<00:05:48.690> graph<00:05:48.870> that's<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.229> pencil<00:05:49.560> I

I am in a subtle graph that's a pencil I

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.439 
I am in a subtle graph that's a pencil I
put<00:05:49.830> in<00:05:49.979> and<00:05:50.219> that's<00:05:50.699> the<00:05:50.880> growth<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.120> it's

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
put in and that's the growth that it's

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.520 
put in and that's the growth that it's
made<00:05:51.630> this<00:05:51.900> year<00:05:52.409> it's<00:05:53.250> made<00:05:53.520> about<00:05:54.210> four<00:05:54.659> feet

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
made this year it's made about four feet

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.950 
made this year it's made about four feet
of<00:05:56.250> growth<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:56.880> this<00:05:57.000> is<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.150> radical<00:05:57.449> blade

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960

can<00:05:58.169> you<00:05:58.259> read<00:05:58.500> very<00:05:59.159> healthy<00:05:59.789> strong<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.539> see

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
can you read very healthy strong you see

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.800 
can you read very healthy strong you see
this<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.199> an<00:06:01.710> important<00:06:02.039> point<00:06:02.190> actually<00:06:02.810> if

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
this is an important point actually if

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.279 
this is an important point actually if
you<00:06:04.020> graphed<00:06:04.699> something<00:06:05.699> like<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.479> onto<00:06:07.050> a

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
you graphed something like this onto a

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.529 
you graphed something like this onto a
strong<00:06:07.979> root<00:06:08.430> stock<00:06:08.759> it<00:06:08.909> may<00:06:09.060> well<00:06:09.240> go<00:06:09.389> a<00:06:09.449> very

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
strong root stock it may well go a very

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.080 
strong root stock it may well go a very
strong<00:06:10.259> that's<00:06:10.740> when<00:06:11.159> it<00:06:11.310> cut<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.580> wind<00:06:11.789> can

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
strong that's when it cut the wind can

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.749 
strong that's when it cut the wind can
catch<00:06:12.330> and<00:06:12.509> it<00:06:12.599> can<00:06:12.719> break<00:06:12.870> off<00:06:13.139> so<00:06:13.349> I've<00:06:13.759> tied

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
catch and it can break off so I've tied

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.749 
catch and it can break off so I've tied
this<00:06:14.940> up<00:06:15.210> here<00:06:15.509> and<00:06:16.009> now<00:06:17.009> we<00:06:17.070> need<00:06:17.520> we<00:06:17.610> should

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
this up here and now we need we should

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.969 
this up here and now we need we should
work<00:06:17.880> two<00:06:18.090> or<00:06:18.120> three<00:06:18.210> years<00:06:18.599> until<00:06:18.900> this<00:06:19.139> this

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
work two or three years until this this

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.659 
work two or three years until this this
route<00:06:20.219> this<00:06:20.820> join<00:06:21.120> becomes<00:06:21.449> vigorous<00:06:21.870> so<00:06:22.740> yeah

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
route this join becomes vigorous so yeah

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.420 
route this join becomes vigorous so yeah
I've<00:06:23.940> got<00:06:24.210> about<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.509> dozen<00:06:25.190> there's<00:06:26.190> another

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
I've got about a dozen there's another

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.800 
I've got about a dozen there's another
