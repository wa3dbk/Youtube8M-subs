00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.330 

and<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.509> it's<00:01:07.020> loading

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.870 

you<00:01:12.640> miss<00:01:12.850> restoring

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.859 

you<00:01:17.540> you're<00:01:17.930> waiting

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
you you're waiting

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.499 
you you're waiting
and<00:01:20.140> it<00:01:20.500> stays<00:01:20.770> like<00:01:21.039> this<00:01:21.070> for<00:01:21.310> like<00:01:21.609> three

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
and it stays like this for like three

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.770 
and it stays like this for like three
minutes<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.979> doesn't<00:01:24.520> do<00:01:24.609> anything<00:01:25.000> at<00:01:25.719> all

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
minutes and doesn't do anything at all

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.359 
minutes and doesn't do anything at all
except<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.689> what<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.960> used<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.409> do<00:01:29.590> was

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
except this now what I used to do was

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.520 
except this now what I used to do was
just<00:01:30.609> let<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.299> keep<00:01:31.509> doing<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:32.380> then

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
just let it keep doing this and then

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.580 
just let it keep doing this and then
just<00:01:32.560> let<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:32.950> die<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.329> then<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.509> figured<00:01:34.929> out<00:01:35.079> a

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
just let it die but then I figured out a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.690 
just let it die but then I figured out a
faster<00:01:36.429> way<00:01:36.719> to<00:01:37.719> fix<00:01:37.929> it<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.280> what<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.490> want<00:01:39.640> to

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
faster way to fix it so what you want to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.230 
faster way to fix it so what you want to
do<00:01:39.819> is<00:01:39.969> hold<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.770> power<00:01:42.039> button<00:01:42.209> right<00:01:43.209> here

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
do is hold the power button right here

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.050 
do is hold the power button right here
and<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.929> home<00:01:44.109> button<00:01:44.439> at<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.590> same<00:01:44.829> time<00:01:45.130> for

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and the home button at the same time for

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.800 
and the home button at the same time for
ten<00:01:46.299> seconds<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.170> Jess

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.670

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
or until it shuts off someone's just

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.820 
or until it shuts off someone's just
shut<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.670> gonna<00:01:56.940> let<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> sit<00:01:57.510> for<00:01:57.540> like

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830
