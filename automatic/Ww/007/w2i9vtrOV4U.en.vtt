where you need to start you've got for

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.439 
where you need to start you've got for
snapping<00:00:57.140> fasteners<00:00:57.710> one<00:00:57.920> here<00:00:58.250> here<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.820> one

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
snapping fasteners one here here and one

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.889 
snapping fasteners one here here and one
here<00:00:59.780> and<00:00:59.989> here<00:01:00.070> up<00:01:01.070> front<00:01:01.520> there<00:01:02.149> are<00:01:02.180> plastic

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
here and here up front there are plastic

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.350 
here and here up front there are plastic
hooks<00:01:03.199> or<00:01:03.710> legs<00:01:04.039> that<00:01:04.309> slide<00:01:04.699> into<00:01:05.270> the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
hooks or legs that slide into the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.480 
hooks or legs that slide into the
headliner<00:01:05.780> assembly<00:01:06.350> if<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:07.009> were<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.190> start

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
headliner assembly if you were to start

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.100 
headliner assembly if you were to start
from<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:07.790> area<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.150> try<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.390> pull<00:01:08.600> down<00:01:08.810> you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
from that area and try to pull down you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.200 
from that area and try to pull down you
would<00:01:09.260> damage<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.770> headliner<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:10.820> we<00:01:10.939> need<00:01:11.119> to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
would damage the headliner so we need to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.210 
would damage the headliner so we need to
start<00:01:11.450> back<00:01:11.720> here<00:01:11.799> towards<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:12.890> rear<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.130> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
start back here towards the rear of the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.820 
start back here towards the rear of the
vehicle<00:01:13.720> it's<00:01:14.720> using<00:01:15.049> your<00:01:15.080> plastic<00:01:15.619> trim

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
vehicle it's using your plastic trim

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.080 
vehicle it's using your plastic trim
stick<00:01:16.130> we're<00:01:16.400> going<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.610> get<00:01:16.670> up<00:01:16.729> under<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
stick we're going to get up under the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.929 
stick we're going to get up under the
edge<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.780> may<00:01:17.930> take<00:01:18.170> some<00:01:18.350> force<00:01:18.939> and

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
edge and it may take some force and

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.550 
edge and it may take some force and
start<00:01:20.210> pulling<00:01:20.420> down<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.140> you'll<00:01:21.290> start

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
start pulling down and you'll start

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.249 
start pulling down and you'll start
hearing<00:01:21.830> them<00:01:21.979> pop<00:01:22.189> loose<00:01:22.460> one<00:01:22.700> at<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.909> time

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
hearing them pop loose one at a time

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.510 
hearing them pop loose one at a time
there<00:01:24.259> we<00:01:24.380> go<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:25.009> we're<00:01:25.159> going<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.310> pull

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
there we go and then we're going to pull

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.820 
there we go and then we're going to pull
back<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.570> then<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:26.840> back<00:01:27.229> piece<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.530> going

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
back and then that back piece is going

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.070 
back and then that back piece is going
to<00:01:27.920> come<00:01:28.040> out<00:01:28.299> now<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:29.509> just<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.780> matter<00:01:29.990> of

getting to all the connectors on the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.460 
getting to all the connectors on the
back<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:32.450> don't<00:01:32.570> have<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.840> lot<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.200> clearance

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470
