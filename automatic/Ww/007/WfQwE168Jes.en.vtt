your<00:00:30.869> head<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.769> right<00:00:31.830> sounds<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.700> we

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
your head all right sounds like so on we

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520 
your head all right sounds like so on we
got<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> bowling<00:00:33.360> ball<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> long<00:00:34.079> string

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
got a bowling ball it's on a long string

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.709 
got a bowling ball it's on a long string
along<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> rope<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.460> 15<00:00:35.880> feet<00:00:36.120> high<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
along the rope about 15 feet high and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.330 
along the rope about 15 feet high and
what<00:00:36.870> we're<00:00:36.989> gonna<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> we're<00:00:37.559> gonna<00:00:37.620> watch

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna watch

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.209 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna watch
it<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.790> okay<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> from<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> has

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it as okay that is from right now it has

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
it as okay that is from right now it has
potential<00:00:41.670> energy<00:00:41.730> okay<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.450> holding<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
potential energy okay I'm holding it I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
potential energy okay I'm holding it I
don't<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.230> four<00:00:43.410> feet<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> ground<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
don't know four feet off the ground if I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.190 
don't know four feet off the ground if I
release<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.149> potential<00:00:45.629> energy<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:46.050> be

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
release it that potential energy can be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
release it that potential energy can be
converted<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.620> kinetic<00:00:46.860> energy<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
converted into kinetic energy as the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
converted into kinetic energy as the
ball<00:00:48.210> moves<00:00:48.960> across<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> floor<00:00:49.770> potential

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
ball moves across the floor potential

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
ball moves across the floor potential

potential<00:00:52.920> energy<00:00:53.100> okay<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.059> shifting

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
potential energy okay so it's shifting

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
potential energy okay so it's shifting
back<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.780> forth<00:00:55.110> okay<00:00:55.320> initial<00:00:55.649> kinetic

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
back and forth okay initial kinetic

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.639 
back and forth okay initial kinetic
potential<00:00:56.520> no<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.629> cool<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
potential no the cool thing about this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.520 
potential no the cool thing about this
is<00:00:59.000> you<00:01:00.000> can't<00:01:00.270> create<00:01:00.600> energy<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.320> can't

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is you can't create energy you can't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
is you can't create energy you can't
it's<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.100> gain<00:01:02.399> any<00:01:02.789> extra<00:01:03.120> energy<00:01:03.449> as

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it's not gonna gain any extra energy as

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's not gonna gain any extra energy as
it's<00:01:03.690> moving<00:01:03.840> okay<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.070> that's<00:01:05.250> where<00:01:05.369> our

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it's moving okay so that's where our

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
it's moving okay so that's where our
little<00:01:05.700> head<00:01:05.939> comes<00:01:06.240> into<00:01:06.479> play<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.840> right

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
little head comes into play here right

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
little head comes into play here right
victim<00:01:07.530> number<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:08.040> victim<00:01:08.460> number<00:01:08.549> one

that's<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.330> we're<00:01:09.420> gonna<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.780> we're

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that's what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.060 
that's what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.320> bowling<00:01:10.590> ball<00:01:10.740> we're<00:01:10.979> gonna

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
gonna take this bowling ball we're gonna

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.399 
gonna take this bowling ball we're gonna
start<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.850> under<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> chin<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
start it right under the chin of this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
start it right under the chin of this
head<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.159> gonna<00:01:14.250> release<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.640> okay<00:01:15.509> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
head and I'm gonna release it okay and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
head and I'm gonna release it okay and
then<00:01:16.409> we're<00:01:16.560> gonna<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:16.950> happens<00:01:17.220> now

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
then we're gonna see what happens now

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.620 
then we're gonna see what happens now
remember<00:01:17.670> Jay<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.970> head<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.240> gonna<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.479> next

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
remember Jay your head is gonna be next

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080 
remember Jay your head is gonna be next
what's<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:19.979> man<00:01:20.189> looks<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.640> all

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
what's just like man looks like all

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
what's just like man looks like all
right<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:21.450> let<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.900> three<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.860> one

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
right here we go let it go three two one

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.050 
right here we go let it go three two one
go

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
go

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.570 
go
and<00:01:25.150> as<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.780> ball<00:01:25.930> comes<00:01:26.170> back<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:27.159> going<00:01:27.430> to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
and as the ball comes back it's going to

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.550 
and as the ball comes back it's going to
oh<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:30.100> about<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.310> car<00:01:30.700> how<00:01:30.970> about<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.330> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
oh how about that car how about that I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.539 
oh how about that car how about that I
was<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:32.680> too<00:01:32.799> freaky<00:01:33.070> out<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.190> little<00:01:33.369> you

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
was just too freaky out a little you

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.640 
was just too freaky out a little you
gave<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:33.909> apart<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.330> gave<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:36.000> push<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.479> this

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
ball rather just be nice to the ball

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.270 
ball rather just be nice to the ball
okay<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:52.750> get<00:01:52.899> rid<00:01:52.990> of<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.140> head<00:01:53.290> let's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
okay so this get rid of the head let's

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.639 
okay so this get rid of the head let's
get<00:01:54.460> rid<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.700> table<00:01:55.030> huh<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:56.110> let's<00:01:56.290> put<00:01:56.440> J

get rid of the table huh and let's put J

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.950 
get rid of the table huh and let's put J
right<00:01:57.009> up<00:01:57.130> against<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.850> column<00:01:58.149> I'm<00:01:58.360> trusting

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
right up against the column I'm trusting

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.510 
right up against the column I'm trusting
science<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.560> get<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.770> trust<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.100> science<00:02:00.220> and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
science you get it trust in science and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.669 
science you get it trust in science and
also<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.880> fact<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.090> don't<00:02:01.300> give<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.679> so

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
also in the fact that don't give it so

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.790 
also in the fact that don't give it so
let's<00:02:02.830> see<00:02:02.920> how<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:03.159> lines<00:02:03.399> up<00:02:03.520> with<00:02:03.700> hi

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
let's see how this lines up with hi

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.279 
let's see how this lines up with hi
looks<00:02:05.800> pretty<00:02:05.950> good<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.369> remember<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.899> most

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
looks pretty good now remember the most

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.280 
looks pretty good now remember the most
important<00:02:08.890> thing<00:02:09.100> is<00:02:09.700> don't<00:02:10.239> freak<00:02:10.929> out<00:02:11.050> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
important thing is don't freak out and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.910 
important thing is don't freak out and
run<00:02:11.470> towards<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.920> ball<00:02:12.100> sounds<00:02:12.489> obvious<00:02:12.790> but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
run towards the ball sounds obvious but

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.540 
run towards the ball sounds obvious but
are<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.069> ready<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.550> I'm<00:02:16.269> ready

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
alright let's do a bird's eye view right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.949 
alright let's do a bird's eye view right
up<00:02:36.790> close<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.269> camera<00:02:37.299> see<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:37.870> this

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
up close to the camera see what this

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.810 
up close to the camera see what this
looks<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:38.470> Jays<00:02:38.769> perspective<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.730> we

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
looks like from Jays perspective here we

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.559 
looks like from Jays perspective here we
go<00:02:39.940> three<00:02:40.390> two<00:02:40.420> one

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.479 

was<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.379> freely<00:02:46.709> no<00:02:46.829> one<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.010> comes<00:02:47.159> back<00:02:47.310> at

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
was that freely no one it comes back at

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.789 
was that freely no one it comes back at
your<00:02:47.609> face<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.909> little<00:02:48.120> freaky<00:02:48.510> every<00:02:49.469> day<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.709> a

trusting that the energy old transfer

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
trusting that the energy old transfer
will<00:02:54.209> stop<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.689> go<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:54.840> right<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.530> we're

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
will stop and go back right and we're

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.899 
will stop and go back right and we're
losing<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.069> little<00:02:56.189> energy<00:02:56.549> due<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.760> air

friction as the ball flies through the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.129 
friction as the ball flies through the
