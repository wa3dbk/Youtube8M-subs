00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.970
 Yaroslav was lighting giving test stage 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.040
 version of world of tanks patch a 093 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 kicked off 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.389
 The highlight of this test has become a new 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.609
 experimental system honest 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.900
 ricochets projectile what is it 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 you ask 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.390
 and how I use it now you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.390
 tell about it and so we went 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.340
 if briefly then on 092 after 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.400
 the projectile flies away from the tank and you hear in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.680
 his headphones the phrase ricochet shell itself 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.850
 losing its physical shape and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 evaporates 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.340
 and now you ask what is yours 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.050
 the suitcase may strike after the rebound 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 close by 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.140
 those who already played the test could even 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 not to notice such innovation 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.180
 since in practice apply honest 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.460
 ricochet extremely hard i would say it 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 new item wbr and which can 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.260
 only show yourself effectively if all 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.840
 the stars will stand in a row she is your bones 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.810
 there will be one six tactically and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.000
 intentionally use this opportunity 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.490
 extremely hard even in training bout 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.250
 because the projectile can not fly in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.280
 the enemy but somewhere in the sky so 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.130
 I ask you not to aim specifically at 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.540
 allies on the team in order to see such 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.290
 effect besides I want to remind that it 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.570
 experimental system 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.570
 and since in practice to implement 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.310
 such an extremely difficult is not the fact that these 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.799
 bounces will be put into play 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.229
 This is especially unlikely if during 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.530
 tests will prove that they are too 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.469
 resource-intensive effect-price ratio 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.930
 everyone who wants to can not agree 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.969
 try this innovation mercy 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.369
 I want you to test server want 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.890
 note that it is especially fun to do 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.009
 such bounce on rt in this mode 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.930
 be sure to try on this all with 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.270
 you were i grew up in lol lighting 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.580
 subscribe to the channel here fan write to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.890
 comments what you think about the new chip 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.830
 and put your fingers up I'm the same with you 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.940
 I say goodbye and see you soon 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.940
 Dear friends
