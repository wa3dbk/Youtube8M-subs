today<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:01.949> talking<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.340> buying<00:00:02.639> a

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
today we're talking about buying a

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.280 
today we're talking about buying a
flight<00:00:03.030> simulator<00:00:03.330> yoke<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.020> what<00:00:04.170> you

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
flight simulator yoke and what you

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.460 
flight simulator yoke and what you
should<00:00:04.440> look<00:00:04.560> out<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:04.980> before<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.400> buy<00:00:06.470> now

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
should look out for before you buy now

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.830 
should look out for before you buy now
if<00:00:07.830> you've<00:00:08.160> been<00:00:08.490> flying<00:00:09.000> using<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> keyboard

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
if you've been flying using the keyboard

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.959 
if you've been flying using the keyboard
and<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.290> mouse<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.860> maybe<00:00:11.130> even<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.490> joystick

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
and the mouse and maybe even a joystick

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.360 
and the mouse and maybe even a joystick
you<00:00:12.030> might<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.690> thinking<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.320> upgrading<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
you might be thinking about upgrading to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.960 
you might be thinking about upgrading to
the<00:00:14.429> next<00:00:14.730> level<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.210> realism<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.970> for

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the next level of realism and and for

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.400 
the next level of realism and and for
many<00:00:18.090> people<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.600> would<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.960> adding<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
many people that would be adding a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.740 
many people that would be adding a
flight<00:00:19.650> simulator<00:00:22.220> it's<00:00:23.220> probably<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.210> one

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
flight simulator it's probably the one

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
flight simulator it's probably the one
improvement<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:26.310> will<00:00:26.460> increase

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
improvement that really will increase

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.750 
improvement that really will increase
the<00:00:27.359> level<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.840> realism<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.640> bring<00:00:29.640> you

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the level of realism and bring you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.400 
the level of realism and bring you
closer<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> feeling<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.810> flying<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.260> real

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
closer to a feeling of flying a real

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340 
closer to a feeling of flying a real
aircraft<00:00:32.329> now<00:00:33.329> there's<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> number<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.079> choose

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
aircraft now there's a number to choose

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.650 
aircraft now there's a number to choose
from<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> worth<00:00:36.120> spending<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
from and so it is worth spending a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.900 
from and so it is worth spending a
little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> time<00:00:37.700> looking<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
little bit of time looking at the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
little bit of time looking at the
differences<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.350> making<00:00:40.890> sure<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
differences and making sure you get the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.779 
differences and making sure you get the
right<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:43.170> first<00:00:43.410> thing<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.770> should<00:00:44.129> just

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
right one the first thing we should just

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
right one the first thing we should just
look<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> compatibility<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> yoke

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
look at is the compatibility of the yoke

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
look at is the compatibility of the yoke
with<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.430> computer<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.719> operating<00:00:49.170> system

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
with your computer your operating system

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
with your computer your operating system
and<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.860> flight<00:00:50.399> simulator<00:00:50.879> software<00:00:51.390> just

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and your flight simulator software just

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.090 
and your flight simulator software just
confirm<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> work

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
confirm that it's going to work

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
confirm that it's going to work
especially<00:00:53.940> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.300> an<00:00:54.420> older<00:00:54.750> system

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
especially if you have an older system

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.540 
especially if you have an older system
that<00:00:55.920> may<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.969> USB<00:00:57.329> ports<00:00:58.520> three<00:00:59.520> USB

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
that may not have USB ports three USB

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
that may not have USB ports three USB
ports<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
ports and make sure that that's the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
ports and make sure that that's the
connection<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> yoke<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.899> connect

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
connection that the yoke will connect

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.910 
connection that the yoke will connect
your<00:01:04.409> computer<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:06.049> most<00:01:07.049> yokes<00:01:07.409> these<00:01:07.680> days

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
your computer with most yokes these days

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
your computer with most yokes these days
are<00:01:08.070> plug-and-play<00:01:08.420> meaning<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.810> can

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
are plug-and-play meaning that you can

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
are plug-and-play meaning that you can
just<00:01:10.140> plug<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> into<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.830> computer<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
just plug it into your computer and a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
just plug it into your computer and a
computer<00:01:11.790> will<00:01:12.689> find<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.740> it'll<00:01:13.890> recognize<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
computer will find it it'll recognize it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
computer will find it it'll recognize it
and<00:01:15.000> you'll<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:16.040> set<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:19.320> also<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.189> check

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and you'll be set just also just check

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.740 
and you'll be set just also just check
that<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> brand<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> flight<00:01:21.330> simulator

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that the brand of the flight simulator

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
that the brand of the flight simulator
software<00:01:22.259> will<00:01:22.439> work<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> yoke<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
software will work with the yoke you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.020 
software will work with the yoke you
don't<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.570> plugging<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.170> new

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
don't want to be plugging in a new

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.370 
don't want to be plugging in a new
flight<00:01:27.030> simulator<00:01:27.420> yoke<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> fiddling<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
flight simulator yoke and fiddling it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.830 
flight simulator yoke and fiddling it
fiddling<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.700> hours<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
fiddling with it for hours just to to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.310 
fiddling with it for hours just to to
get<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.079> recognized<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.829> working<00:01:33.320> another

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get it recognized and working another

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
get it recognized and working another
point<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> sometimes<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> overlooked<00:01:36.119> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
point that sometimes is overlooked is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.580 
point that sometimes is overlooked is
just<00:01:37.640> making<00:01:38.640> sure<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.360> looking<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.290> where

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
just making sure and looking at where

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
just making sure and looking at where
the<00:01:40.770> yoke<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> actually<00:01:41.460> made<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the yoke is actually made and what it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.440 
the yoke is actually made and what it's
made<00:01:42.780> from

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
made from

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
made from
you<00:01:45.450> pay<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> cheap<00:01:47.270> made

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you pay for if you go for a cheap made

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.470 
you pay for if you go for a cheap made
out<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> light<00:01:49.079> plastic<00:01:49.680> parts

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.240 

and<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:57.500> feel<00:01:58.500> light<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.400> weak<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:01.250> what

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and it will feel light and weak so what

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.770 
and it will feel light and weak so what
we're<00:02:02.400> actually<00:02:02.520> looking<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.300> control

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
we're actually looking for is a control

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.160 
we're actually looking for is a control
that<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.200> simulate<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.400> real<00:02:06.020> control<00:02:07.020> in

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that will simulate the real control in

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
that will simulate the real control in
an<00:02:07.260> aircraft<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.730> don't<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:09.119> something

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
an aircraft and we don't want something

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.520 
an aircraft and we don't want something
that<00:02:09.600> looks<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:10.500> feels<00:02:10.680> like<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> toy<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.530> if

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that looks and feels like a toy so if
