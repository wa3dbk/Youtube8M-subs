cut<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:24.010> backwards<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.860> little<00:02:27.099> groove

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
cut is backwards it's a little groove

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.229 
cut is backwards it's a little groove
into<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:31.709> gently<00:02:32.709> let<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.459> saw<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.030> work

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
into it gently let the saw do the work

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:45.720 
into it gently let the saw do the work
you<00:02:34.870> don't<00:02:34.959> have<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.230> press<00:02:35.380> hard<00:02:44.580> drag<00:02:45.580> your

you don't have to press hard drag your

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.820 
you don't have to press hard drag your
sandpaper<00:02:46.239> just<00:02:48.720> smooth<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.989> off<00:02:50.110> on<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
sandpaper just smooth it off on the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.940 
sandpaper just smooth it off on the
inside<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.049> gets<00:02:53.230> all<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.530> little<00:02:53.739> bits<00:02:53.890> of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
inside so it gets all the little bits of

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.410 
inside so it gets all the little bits of
PVC<00:02:54.519> off<00:02:57.090> fine

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
PVC off fine

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.820 
PVC off fine
so<00:02:59.230> next<00:02:59.650> day<00:02:59.799> each<00:02:59.980> take<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.620> tape

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so next day each take you get the tape

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.509 
so next day each take you get the tape
or<00:03:03.459> duct<00:03:03.880> tape<00:03:04.830> we're<00:03:05.830> just<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.160> wrap<00:03:06.340> it

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:15.989 

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:18.809 

stretch<00:05:16.989> the<00:05:17.229> balloon<00:05:17.319> slightly<00:05:18.039> so<00:05:18.669> it's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.980 

I<00:05:33.250> find<00:05:34.250> three-year-olds<00:05:35.240> can<00:05:35.420> blow<00:05:35.660> it<00:05:35.720> but

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
I find three-year-olds can blow it but

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.040 
I find three-year-olds can blow it but
they<00:05:36.200> need<00:05:36.410> to<00:05:36.560> have<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.860> held<00:05:37.130> for<00:05:37.310> them

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
they need to have it held for them

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.150 
they need to have it held for them
four-year-olds<00:05:39.050> can<00:05:39.230> learn<00:05:39.440> how<00:05:39.650> to<00:05:39.680> hold<00:05:39.950> it

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
four-year-olds can learn how to hold it

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.540 
four-year-olds can learn how to hold it
but<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:40.400> takes<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.760> fair<00:05:41.000> amount<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.330> time<00:05:41.570> and

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
but it takes a fair amount of time and

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.380 
but it takes a fair amount of time and
five-year-olds<00:05:43.550> get<00:05:43.670> it<00:05:43.760> very<00:05:44.060> quickly

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
five-year-olds get it very quickly

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.050 
five-year-olds get it very quickly
indeed<00:05:44.960> it's<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:46.190> it's<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.730> great<00:05:46.940> little

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
indeed it's a it's a great little

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.780 
indeed it's a it's a great little
