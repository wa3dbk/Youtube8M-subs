drive almost to the mountain before you

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
drive almost to the mountain before you
can<00:02:51.060> get<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.240> signal<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.810> back<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.350> where

can get a signal going back to where

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.460 
can get a signal going back to where
it's<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:52.800> coming<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
it's actually coming from so that's a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.430 
it's actually coming from so that's a
typical<00:02:55.680> trick<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.670> use<00:02:56.880> but<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.260> approach

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
