for<00:00:01.520> this<00:00:01.609> demonstration<00:00:01.879> I'm<00:00:02.600> going<00:00:02.630> to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.610 
for this demonstration I'm going to

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.450 
for this demonstration I'm going to
discuss<00:00:04.610> limited<00:00:05.600> palette<00:00:06.080> this<00:00:06.920> is<00:00:06.980> a<00:00:07.130> short

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
discuss limited palette this is a short

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.089 
discuss limited palette this is a short
demonstration<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:08.509> what<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:09.619> point<00:00:09.860> of<00:00:09.950> it

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
demonstration and what the point of it

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.310 
demonstration and what the point of it
really<00:00:10.429> is<00:00:10.669> to<00:00:11.030> show<00:00:11.360> what<00:00:11.839> a<00:00:11.869> lot<00:00:12.110> of<00:00:12.139> the

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
really is to show what a lot of the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.499 
really is to show what a lot of the
artists<00:00:12.799> in<00:00:12.919> American<00:00:12.980> artists<00:00:13.730> talk<00:00:14.179> about

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
artists in American artists talk about

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.770 
artists in American artists talk about
which<00:00:14.749> is<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:16.060> importance<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.270> relative

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
which is the importance of relative

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.220 
which is the importance of relative
value<00:00:18.290> as<00:00:18.530> opposed<00:00:19.070> to<00:00:19.220> color<00:00:19.810> many<00:00:20.810> artists

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
value as opposed to color many artists

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.410 
value as opposed to color many artists
say<00:00:21.380> that<00:00:21.590> if<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:21.830> get<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:22.250> relative<00:00:23.000> value

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
say that if you get the relative value

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.300 
say that if you get the relative value
correct<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:23.990> relative<00:00:24.410> color<00:00:24.740> temperature

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
correct the relative color temperature

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.650 
correct the relative color temperature
correct<00:00:25.760> in<00:00:25.940> other<00:00:26.060> words<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.480> relationship

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
correct in other words the relationship

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.279 
correct in other words the relationship
between<00:00:27.410> those<00:00:28.400> values<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.630> colors<00:00:30.020> it

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
between those values and the colors it

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.139 
between those values and the colors it
doesn't<00:00:31.039> necessarily<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:31.789> doesn't<00:00:32.059> really

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
doesn't necessarily it doesn't really

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.029 
doesn't necessarily it doesn't really
make<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.449> difference<00:00:32.599> what<00:00:33.170> pigments<00:00:33.679> you<00:00:33.769> use

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
make a difference what pigments you use

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.130 
make a difference what pigments you use
any<00:00:34.339> blue<00:00:34.670> will<00:00:34.879> work<00:00:35.089> any<00:00:35.269> red<00:00:35.539> will<00:00:35.749> work<00:00:35.929> and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
any blue will work any red will work and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.319 
any blue will work any red will work and
yellow<00:00:36.350> will<00:00:36.620> work<00:00:36.829> as<00:00:37.100> long<00:00:37.820> as<00:00:37.999> you<00:00:38.120> have

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
yellow will work as long as you have

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.720 
yellow will work as long as you have
things<00:00:38.629> properly<00:00:39.199> mixed<00:00:39.620> in<00:00:39.800> relationship<00:00:40.579> to

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
things properly mixed in relationship to

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.180 
things properly mixed in relationship to
each<00:00:40.760> other<00:00:41.059> now<00:00:41.989> maybe<00:00:42.199> that's<00:00:42.379> not<00:00:42.589> totally

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
each other now maybe that's not totally

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.180 
each other now maybe that's not totally
control<00:00:43.760> or<00:00:44.510> beginning<00:00:44.870> artists<00:00:45.440> it's<00:00:45.559> all<00:00:45.769> it

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
control or beginning artists it's all it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.610 
control or beginning artists it's all it
is<00:00:46.429> helpful<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.239> deal<00:00:47.899> with<00:00:48.109> the<00:00:48.229> issue<00:00:48.409> of

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
is helpful to deal with the issue of

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.729 
is helpful to deal with the issue of
relative<00:00:49.219> value<00:00:49.670> first<00:00:50.260> get<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.469> under

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
relative value first get that under

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.239 
relative value first get that under
control

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
control

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.669 
control
and<00:00:52.460> then<00:00:52.819> expand<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.809> palette<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.289> colors

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
and then expand the palette of colors

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.450 
and then expand the palette of colors
that<00:00:54.710> give<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.489> greater<00:00:55.850> range<00:00:56.149> of<00:00:56.449> options

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
that give you a greater range of options

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.279 
that give you a greater range of options
in<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.639> case<00:00:58.879> I've<00:00:59.149> used<00:00:59.179> a<00:00:59.690> limited<00:01:00.049> palette

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
in this case I've used a limited palette

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.709 
in this case I've used a limited palette
that<00:01:00.589> was<00:01:00.710> recommended<00:01:01.069> by<00:01:01.609> Daniel<00:01:02.420> graves

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
that was recommended by Daniel graves

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.770 
that was recommended by Daniel graves
which<00:01:03.079> is<00:01:03.440> Venetian<00:01:04.220> red<00:01:04.570> French<00:01:05.570> ultramarine

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
which is Venetian red French ultramarine

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.080 
which is Venetian red French ultramarine
blue<00:01:06.230> titanium<00:01:07.100> white<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.540> yellow<00:01:08.870> ochre

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
blue titanium white and a yellow ochre

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.570 
blue titanium white and a yellow ochre
you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.270> use<00:01:11.450> other<00:01:11.810> types<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.710> yellows<00:01:13.160> other

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
you can use other types of yellows other

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.060 
you can use other types of yellows other
Reds<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.870> important<00:01:15.320> thing<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.920> these

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
Reds the important thing is that these

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.170 
Reds the important thing is that these
be<00:01:16.400> very<00:01:16.760> intense<00:01:17.210> pigments<00:01:18.550> because<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.910> can

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
be very intense pigments because you can

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.750 
be very intense pigments because you can
you<00:01:20.480> you<00:01:20.900> can't<00:01:21.170> go<00:01:21.320> up<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.950> intensity<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.730> can

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
you you can't go up in intensity you can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.790 
you you can't go up in intensity you can
only<00:01:23.030> come<00:01:23.330> down<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.780> intensity<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.590> in<00:01:24.710> other

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
only come down in intensity so in other

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.590 
only come down in intensity so in other
words<00:01:25.040> if<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.340> start<00:01:25.400> out<00:01:25.880> with<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:26.060> very<00:01:26.150> weak

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
words if you start out with a very weak

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.470 
words if you start out with a very weak
blue<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.740> impossible<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.490> be<00:01:28.640> impossible<00:01:29.180> to

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
blue it's impossible to be impossible to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.660 
blue it's impossible to be impossible to
make<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.810> really<00:01:30.230> dark<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.740> intense<00:01:31.070> however

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
make it really dark and intense however

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.030 
make it really dark and intense however
if<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.940> start<00:01:32.300> with<00:01:32.450> an<00:01:32.600> intense<00:01:32.960> blue<00:01:33.230> you

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
if you start with an intense blue you

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.890 
if you start with an intense blue you
can<00:01:34.250> make<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.670> thinner<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.300> can<00:01:35.510> mix<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:35.840> with

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
can make it thinner you can mix it with

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.900 
can make it thinner you can mix it with
white<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.560> can<00:01:36.710> mix<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.010> with<00:01:37.040> yellow<00:01:37.370> you<00:01:37.610> can

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
white you can mix it with yellow you can

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.630 
white you can mix it with yellow you can
mix<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.360> other<00:01:38.510> words<00:01:38.980> it's<00:01:39.980> easier<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:40.520> go

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
mix it in other words it's easier to go

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.240 
mix it in other words it's easier to go
down<00:01:40.820> in<00:01:41.000> value<00:01:41.030> than<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.660> go<00:01:41.810> up<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:42.770> if

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
down in value than to go up and so if

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.460 
down in value than to go up and so if
you<00:01:43.400> take<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.120> red<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> yellow<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.110> blue<00:01:45.140> and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
you take the red a yellow and a blue and

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.590 
you take the red a yellow and a blue and
a<00:01:45.560> white<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:46.190> they<00:01:46.370> are<00:01:46.520> all<00:01:46.760> three<00:01:47.090> intense

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
a white and they are all three intense

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.300 
a white and they are all three intense
meaning<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.170> they<00:01:48.350> are<00:01:48.380> cadmium<00:01:49.100> Zoar

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
meaning that they are cadmium Zoar

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.080 
meaning that they are cadmium Zoar
they're<00:01:49.430> earth<00:01:49.700> colors

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
they're earth colors

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.200 
they're earth colors
you<00:01:51.330> can<00:01:51.540> block<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.680> most<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.190> picture<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
you can block in most of the picture in

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.360 
you can block in most of the picture in
this<00:01:54.360> case<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.750> started<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> base<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:56.070> an

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
this case I started with the base of an

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.470 
this case I started with the base of an
Indian<00:01:56.850> red<00:01:57.890> used<00:01:58.890> an<00:01:59.760> old<00:02:00.030> French

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
Indian red used an old French

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.900 
Indian red used an old French
ultramarine<00:02:00.690> blue<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.680> darken<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.550> make<00:02:02.730> it

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
ultramarine blue to darken it to make it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.420 
ultramarine blue to darken it to make it
blue<00:02:03.150> or<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.420> certain<00:02:04.170> areas<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.160> used

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
blue or in certain areas and then I used

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.120 
blue or in certain areas and then I used
a<00:02:05.580> titanium<00:02:05.820> white<00:02:06.570> first<00:02:07.020> starting<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.530> a

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
a titanium white first starting with a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.760 
a titanium white first starting with a
fast-drying<00:02:09.090> alkyd<00:02:09.960> white<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.500> moving

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
fast-drying alkyd white and then moving

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.670 
fast-drying alkyd white and then moving
to<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.430> traditional<00:02:12.030> oil<00:02:12.270> white<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.870> I'm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to just a traditional oil white and I'm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
to just a traditional oil white and I'm
trying<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> block<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.750> at<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.170> same

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
trying to block it all in at the same

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.620 
trying to block it all in at the same
time<00:02:16.500> I'm<00:02:16.890> also<00:02:17.130> trying<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.760> keep<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.210> values

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
time I'm also trying to keep the values

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.500 
time I'm also trying to keep the values
relatively<00:02:19.350> close<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.940> resulting

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
relatively close so that the resulting

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
relatively close so that the resulting
picture<00:02:21.870> has<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> more<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> sense<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
picture has a more of a sense of a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.890 
picture has a more of a sense of a
movement<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:24.270> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
movement to it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.950 
movement to it
soft<00:02:25.350> edges<00:02:25.920> subtle<00:02:26.910> transitions<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.780> values

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
soft edges subtle transitions and values

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130 
soft edges subtle transitions and values
close<00:02:30.960> proximity<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.890> color<00:02:32.370> range<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:34.110> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
close proximity in color range so that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.170 
close proximity in color range so that
in<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> end<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.010> more<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.610> an<00:02:35.790> kind<00:02:36.090> of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
in the end there is more of an kind of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.610 
in the end there is more of an kind of
an<00:02:36.270> atmospheric<00:02:37.050> look<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.710> picture<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.470> as

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
an atmospheric look to the picture so as

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.350 
an atmospheric look to the picture so as
I've<00:02:40.740> been<00:02:40.920> working<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.490> picture<00:02:41.760> I've

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I've been working on this picture I've

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.930 
I've been working on this picture I've
only<00:02:42.600> used<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:43.530> brush<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.520> haven't<00:02:44.820> added

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
only used one brush and I haven't added

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.150 
only used one brush and I haven't added
any<00:02:45.210> colors<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> palette<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:46.950> still

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
any colors to the palette so it's still

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.800 
any colors to the palette so it's still
basically<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.910> blue<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.360> red<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.780> yellow

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
basically the blue the red the yellow

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.910 
basically the blue the red the yellow
and<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:50.220> white<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:52.020> I've<00:02:52.170> been<00:02:52.200> doing<00:02:52.380> is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
and the white and all I've been doing is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.090 
and the white and all I've been doing is
sort<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.610> subtly<00:02:54.380> blending<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> colors<00:02:55.920> on

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
sort of subtly blending the colors on

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.690 
sort of subtly blending the colors on
the<00:02:56.220> palette<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.270> painting<00:02:58.700> increasing

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
the palette on the painting increasing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.850 
the palette on the painting increasing
the<00:02:59.820> intensity<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.870> wide<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.740> know

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the intensity of the wide and you know

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.730 
the intensity of the wide and you know
that<00:03:02.010> sort<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.280> thing<00:03:03.200> trying<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.380> get<00:03:04.560> that

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
that sort of thing trying to get that

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.300 
that sort of thing trying to get that
the<00:03:05.280> subtlety<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.800> avoiding<00:03:07.800> making<00:03:07.950> random

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the subtlety and avoiding making random

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
the subtlety and avoiding making random
mistakes<00:03:08.910> here<00:03:11.840> basically<00:03:12.840> trying<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.200> play

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
mistakes here basically trying to play

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
exercise because it shows you what you

can get out of each of the colors on

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.740 
can get out of each of the colors on
your<00:03:34.050> palette<00:03:34.700> how<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:36.030> manipulate<00:03:36.300> the
