was visiting my clan and I asked her a
couple<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.430> questions<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.180> could<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.450> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
couple of questions so we could get to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.080 
couple of questions so we could get to
know<00:00:48.600> her<00:00:48.930> her<00:00:49.649> base<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.100> completely<00:00:50.489> farmed

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
know her her base is completely farmed

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
know her her base is completely farmed
but<00:00:51.870> she<00:00:52.289> did<00:00:52.440> gem<00:00:52.649> her<00:00:52.829> barracks<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.399> her

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

9<00:00:56.520> trophy<00:00:57.000> record<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:58.230> really<00:00:58.410> relate<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
9 trophy record I could really relate to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.220 
9 trophy record I could really relate to
her<00:00:59.010> though<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.190> she's<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.969> me<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> she

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
her though because she's like me and she

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.200 
her though because she's like me and she
tries<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> limit<00:01:01.770> her<00:01:02.010> spells<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.579> zero<00:01:02.850> damage

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
tries to limit her spells of zero damage

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
tries to limit her spells of zero damage
I<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.559> her<00:01:04.710> strategy<00:01:04.949> though<00:01:05.339> she

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
I really like her strategy though she

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
I really like her strategy though she
doesn't<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:05.939> go<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.210> Town<00:01:06.630> Hall's<00:01:06.900> what

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
doesn't really go for Town Hall's what

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.120 
doesn't really go for Town Hall's what
she<00:01:07.950> tries<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:09.330> 50%<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.409> she'll

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
she tries to do is get 50% and she'll

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
she tries to do is get 50% and she'll
use<00:01:11.159> her<00:01:11.310> balloons<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.060> take<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> air

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
use her balloons to take out the air

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.170 
use her balloons to take out the air
defenses<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:14.220> clean<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> buildings

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
defenses and then clean up the buildings

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
defenses and then clean up the buildings
with<00:01:15.390> minions<00:01:15.710> she<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:16.920> seems<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> favor

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
with minions she really seems to favor

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
with minions she really seems to favor
this<00:01:17.729> style<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> base<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.900> may<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.140> Sara

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this style of base you may have Sara

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350 
this style of base you may have Sara
attacked<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> same<00:01:20.220> style<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.640> base<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.060> other

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
attacked the same style of base in other

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
attacked the same style of base in other
youtubers<00:01:21.840> videos<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
youtubers videos so that's really the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.700 
youtubers videos so that's really the
reason<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.780> Hocking<00:01:25.259> bases

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
reason why I don't like Hocking bases

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
reason why I don't like Hocking bases
because<00:01:26.369> people<00:01:26.909> figure<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> beat

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
because people figure out how to beat

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
because people figure out how to beat
them<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.040> becomes<00:01:29.340> easy<00:01:29.549> for

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
them and then it just becomes easy for

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910 
them and then it just becomes easy for
them<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> win<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.750> they've<00:01:31.320> practiced

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
them to win because they've practiced

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670 
them to win because they've practiced
attacking<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> styler<00:01:32.850> base<00:01:33.060> before<00:01:33.680> there's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
attacking the styler base before there's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140 
attacking the styler base before there's
a<00:01:34.770> certain<00:01:35.100> style<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> base<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.820> love

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
a certain style of base that I love

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
a certain style of base that I love
attacking<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.869> barbarians<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> archers

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
attacking with barbarians and archers

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
attacking with barbarians and archers
because<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.030> first<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> attacked<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
because the first time I attacked it I

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
because the first time I attacked it I
actually<00:01:40.110> lost<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.759> second<00:01:42.150> time<00:01:42.329> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
actually lost and the second time I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.850 
actually lost and the second time I
learned<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.049> mistakes

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
learned from my mistakes

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.730 
learned from my mistakes
and<00:01:43.979> figured<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> beat<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.439> now<00:01:46.439> every

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and figured out how to beat it now every

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
and figured out how to beat it now every

to smash the Town Hall so I don't really

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.330 
to smash the Town Hall so I don't really

know what spells to use but I brought

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.119 
know what spells to use but I brought

along one lightning spell three rage and
one<00:02:30.340> healing<00:02:30.760> alright<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.930> let's<00:02:32.110> try<00:02:32.230> not<00:02:32.410> to

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
one healing alright so let's try not to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.860 
one healing alright so let's try not to
pull<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.709> chief<00:02:32.920> Pat<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.510> one<00:02:34.690> thing

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
pull the chief Pat and the one thing

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.690 
pull the chief Pat and the one thing
that<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.620> multiple<00:02:36.129> set<00:02:36.310> Inferno

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
that I do know is multiple set Inferno

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.400 
that I do know is multiple set Inferno
towers<00:02:37.000> will<00:02:37.239> pop<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:38.019> out<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.260> my

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
towers will pop the out of my

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.140 
towers will pop the out of my
balloons<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.340> we're<00:02:39.610> gonna<00:02:39.700> try<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.000> avoid

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
balloons so we're gonna try and avoid

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.330 
balloons so we're gonna try and avoid
those<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.690> I've<00:02:41.319> decided<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.920> attack<00:02:42.190> this

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
those and I've decided to attack this

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.949 
those and I've decided to attack this
base<00:02:42.430> because<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.209> them<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.450> set<00:02:43.840> to

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
base because one of them is set to

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.110 
base because one of them is set to
single<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.010> other<00:02:45.129> one<00:02:45.280> seems<00:02:45.579> far

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
single and the other one seems far

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.180 
single and the other one seems far
enough<00:02:46.269> away<00:02:46.420> from<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.780> Town<00:02:47.019> Hall<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.980> we

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
enough away from the Town Hall so we

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.000 
enough away from the Town Hall so we
should<00:02:48.489> be<00:02:48.640> fine<00:02:48.879> I<00:02:49.120> think<00:02:49.349> now<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.379> I<00:02:50.620> think

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
should be fine I think now that I think

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.580 
should be fine I think now that I think
about<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.579> free<00:02:51.790> spell<00:02:52.060> would<00:02:52.269> be<00:02:52.390> nice<00:02:52.599> but

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
about it a free spell would be nice but

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.449 
about it a free spell would be nice but
it's<00:02:53.739> too<00:02:53.980> late<00:02:54.099> for<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it's too late for that

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.460 
it's too late for that
so<00:02:54.910> we're<00:02:55.629> just<00:02:55.660> gonna<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.140> give<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.410> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
so we're just gonna have to give it a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.690 
so we're just gonna have to give it a
shot<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:58.000> think<00:02:58.269> if<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.470> can<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.980> think<00:03:00.489> we<00:03:00.549> can

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
shot and I think if I can I think we can

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.099 
shot and I think if I can I think we can
take<00:03:00.910> out<00:03:01.060> those<00:03:01.239> wizard<00:03:01.629> towers<00:03:01.870> pretty

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
take out those wizard towers pretty

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.080 
take out those wizard towers pretty
quickly<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:02.829> an<00:03:03.190> air<00:03:03.340> defense<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:03.849> I'm<00:03:03.970> gonna

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
quickly and an air defense so I'm gonna

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.360 
quickly and an air defense so I'm gonna
attack<00:03:04.329> from<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:04.720> side<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.829> we<00:03:06.220> don't

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
attack from this side and we don't

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.619 
attack from this side and we don't
really<00:03:06.459> have<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.730> worry<00:03:06.910> about<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.239> single

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
really have to worry about that single

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.869 
really have to worry about that single
set<00:03:07.810> Inferno<00:03:08.230> tower<00:03:08.410> okay<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.340> from<00:03:09.609> what<00:03:09.760> I've

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
set Inferno tower okay so from what I've

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.400 
set Inferno tower okay so from what I've
seen<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.239> drop<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.569> balloons<00:03:10.870> first<00:03:11.170> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
seen you drop the balloons first and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.729 
seen you drop the balloons first and
follow<00:03:12.400> behind<00:03:12.730> with<00:03:13.239> minions<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.989> should

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
follow behind with minions I should

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.199 
follow behind with minions I should
probably<00:03:14.889> drop<00:03:15.099> a<00:03:15.160> rage<00:03:15.489> spell<00:03:15.819> right<00:03:15.970> about

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
probably drop a rage spell right about

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.960 
probably drop a rage spell right about
now<00:03:16.389> that<00:03:16.630> would<00:03:16.750> be<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.900> pretty<00:03:17.319> good<00:03:17.500> idea

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
now that would be a pretty good idea

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.129 
now that would be a pretty good idea
 I<00:03:19.150> really<00:03:19.299> hope<00:03:19.569> we<00:03:19.599> can<00:03:19.750> get<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.049> this

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
 I really hope we can get to this

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.259
