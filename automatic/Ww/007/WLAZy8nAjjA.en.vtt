 wooden floor is a product for long 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.180
 years however it takes him 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.510
 proper installation and proper behind it 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.480
 care 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 I will show you how to properly stack 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.410
 multi-layered floor with no cool lock bar 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.649
 click on the show we will lay 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.239
 in a floating way 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.730
 Barlinek floorboard is a natural 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.829
 product made entirely from 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 wood sustainable swings 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.910
 temperature and humidity 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.039
 modern flooring consists not 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.719
 from one a to three cross 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.360
 arranged layers of wood 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.280
 each floorboard is ready 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.379
 varnished or oiled product 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 which are ready for operation immediately 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.329
 after laying everyone who has at least 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.219
 a drop of desire to do repairs can 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.090
 lay flooring periwinkle 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.090
 by myself 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.650
 before laying wooden multilayer 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.930
 floors should finish all wet 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.540
 work on the surface of the walls of ceilings and 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.510
 mansard bevels such as primer 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.920
 putty painting or application 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.500
 decorative plaster 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.700
 the base should be clean vacuumed 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.320
 otherwise and without cracking the room and the base 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.850
 on which we will lay the floor 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.960
 must match the following 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.480
 condition 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.790
 moisture of the concrete base should not 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.500
 exceed 2 percent and for gypsum 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.300
 reason half percent 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.310
 temperature during laying and 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.700
 operating our floor must 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.700
 be between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.540
 and relative humidity from 45 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.580
 up to 60 percent is also important quality 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.390
 screeds on which the floor will be laid 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.830
 put on the screed level 2 meters long 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.320
 base deviation 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.670
 should not exceed 3 millimeters across 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.709
 the length of the level is necessary to parquet 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.650
 board acclimatized in the factory 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.930
 packaging at the place of laying at least 48 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.180
 hours prior to laying in the meantime 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.160
 wooden floor must adapt to 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.430
 conditions in which it will fit 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.239
 and be exploited for laying our 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.410
 the floor will need a hammer 1000 grams 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.870
 professional movable bar 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.300
 mounting bracket 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.489
 restrictive wedges 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.090
 electric or hand saw knife for 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.510
 cutting 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.519
 tape measure pencil our floor we will 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.130
 laid on a substrate of natural and 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.110
 the truth is such a substrate aligns everything 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.090
 foundation deficiencies and will enhance 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.290
 acoustic and thermal comfort 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.050
 full of pride 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.330
 unwinding cork rolls do not forget about 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.209
 need to leave compensatory 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.320
 10 mm wide seams around the walls and 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.840
 other obstacles 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.420
 the next lanes of the cork unfold 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.340
 stacking butt-footed further rows 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.150
 substrates are laid as you move 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.620
 of works 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.720
 the direction of laying parquet boards 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.360
 due to the size of the room and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.460
 direction of the sun's rays 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.200
 if none of the walls of the room are 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.400
 exceeds 8 meters we recommend 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.140
 to lay 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.230
 along the direction of the fall of the sun 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.430
 rays that is perpendicular to the most 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 lighted windows 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.350
 if the size of the room is more than eight 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.420
 meters or it is shaped long and narrow 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.520
 like for example the board corridor is always 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.430
 should be laid along the longest 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.840
 walls 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.590
 after determining the direction of laying 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 sex 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.210
 measure the width of the room from the received 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.910
 the size we take away the width of the gaps between 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.040
 board and wall are usually two 15 each 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.260
 millimeters and divide by the width of one 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.000
 boards so we calculate how many complete 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.160
 rows of boards will be laid 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.470
 and how wide should be cut in 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.230
 last row of boards if last row 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.000
 boards come out already than 70 millimeters then 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.170
 should also be cut first 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 we stack or almost with boards we cut 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.620
 stabbed at it so as not to hurt 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.620
 face to yearn 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.780
 do not forget that the floorboard 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.810
 this is one hundred percent wood not every 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.030
 the board has a unique exterior in front 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.550
 the installation should be laid out boards 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.650
 from the opened package and outline the drawing 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.729
 the floor after that you can proceed to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.010
 laying a halter on the boards of the first row in 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.830
 goal and cut off the protruding comb on 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.139
 long and short side it will allow 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.060
 leave the required expansion joint 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:00.460
 that is, the gap between the wall and the floor 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.100
 water on the first yes yes money goldratt 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.510
 rated by forcing the color barbell 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.510
 steel by 15 millimeters 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.949
 remember to shift between the end 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.960
 board connectors in adjacent rows 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.699
 was at least fifty 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.430
 centimeters

 boards lock bar click connect tamping 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.900
 they are applied from the end sides 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.090
 next board and with the help under 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.220
 bending bar and hammer beat 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.830
 the board from the longitudinal side is the same 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.220
 we perform actions when laying the following 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.760
 rows 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.610
 floor mounting last floor row 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.370
 perform measuring the width of the board , taking into account 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.710
 clearance from the wall 15 millimeter board 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.960
 egged on by means of mounting brackets are 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.410
 do the same actions with the following 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.410
 boards 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.180
 laying the floor in the doorway 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.070
 Be sure to leave compensatory 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.530
 20 mm seam 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.730
 the next step is laying the floor 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.020
 installation of the plinth after installation 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.310
 baseboards our floor is ready for use 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.680
 I invite you to watch our videos
