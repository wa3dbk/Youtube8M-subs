00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
tight you don't want any leakage so is

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
tight you don't want any leakage so is
it<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> leak<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.930> next<00:01:18.930> thing<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it going to leak and the next thing I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
it going to leak and the next thing I
think<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.770> line<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.460> importance<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
think in line with importance from you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.249 
think in line with importance from you
know<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.210> order<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> importance

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
know one down so in order of importance

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
know one down so in order of importance
i<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.280> enough<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
i think is it think enough because it's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.149 
i think is it think enough because it's
not<00:01:27.930> good<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> last<00:01:28.860> it's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
not good if it's not going to last it's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
not good if it's not going to last it's
not<00:01:29.280> worth<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> money<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.630> again<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:30.990> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
not worth the money then again if it's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
not worth the money then again if it's
worth<00:01:31.229> two<00:01:31.409> dollars<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.759> honestly<00:01:33.000> i

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
worth two dollars you know honestly i

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
worth two dollars you know honestly i
wouldn't<00:01:33.509> pay<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.840> something<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.140> cheap<00:01:34.470> i

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
wouldn't pay for something that cheap i

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.679 
wouldn't pay for something that cheap i
think<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:35.970> draws<00:01:36.180> people<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.570> buy

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
think that's what draws people to buy

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.410 
think that's what draws people to buy
those<00:01:36.930> they're<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> cheap<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
those they're that cheap and then I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
those they're that cheap and then I
think<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:39.960> again<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.439> why<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.770> sell<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
think then again that's why they sell so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
think then again that's why they sell so
many<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> buy<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.950> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
many because you got to buy more and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.999 
many because you got to buy more and
then<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.579> come<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.090> colors<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:46.009> think

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
then get come in pretty colors I think

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.530 
then get come in pretty colors I think

2,000 milliliters at the top and of

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.180 
2,000 milliliters at the top and of
course<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> little<00:03:35.480> more<00:03:35.570> space<00:03:35.780> at<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:35.989> top

let's<00:03:40.190> see<00:03:40.310> what<00:03:40.430> else<00:03:40.459> we<00:03:40.730> got<00:03:40.850> here<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.239> like

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
let's see what else we got here is like

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.150 
let's see what else we got here is like
I<00:03:41.780> said<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.080> very<00:03:42.260> thick<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:42.769> got<00:03:42.980> their

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
I said it's very thick it's got their

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.699 
I said it's very thick it's got their
branding<00:03:43.580> on<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.989> cap<00:03:45.200> it's<00:03:45.440> tight

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
branding on it I like the cap it's tight

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.190 
branding on it I like the cap it's tight
there's<00:03:46.100> no<00:03:46.250> leakage<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.970> think<00:03:47.750> with<00:03:47.900> every

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
there's no leakage I think with every

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.720 
there's no leakage I think with every
bottle<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.560> know<00:03:48.680> how<00:03:48.769> they<00:03:48.920> have<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.190> rig

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
bottle you know how they have the rig

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.729 
bottle you know how they have the rig
ridges<00:03:50.390> around<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.870> top<00:03:51.050> just<00:03:51.260> for<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.500> screw

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
ridges around the top just for the screw

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.680 
ridges around the top just for the screw
in<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.100> think<00:03:52.640> any<00:03:52.850> kind<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.150> liquids<00:03:53.480> going<00:03:53.630> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
in I think any kind of liquids going to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.850 
in I think any kind of liquids going to
get<00:03:53.810> trapped<00:03:54.019> there<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.410> whenever<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.739> take

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
get trapped there so whenever you take

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.259 
get trapped there so whenever you take
the<00:03:55.010> cap<00:03:55.190> off<00:03:55.340> there's<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.640> little<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.090> cap

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
the cap off there's a little in the cap

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.210 
the cap off there's a little in the cap
and<00:03:56.510> there's<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:57.050> little<00:03:57.200> on<00:03:57.410> those<00:03:57.590> ridges<00:03:57.830> so

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
and there's a little on those ridges so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.130 
and there's a little on those ridges so
you<00:03:58.670> might<00:03:58.970> get<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.180> drip<00:03:59.480> like<00:03:59.720> right<00:03:59.930> here

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
you might get a drip like right here

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.630 
you might get a drip like right here
you're<00:04:00.290> just<00:04:00.470> going<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.680> wipe<00:04:00.800> is<00:04:01.040> it's<00:04:01.310> no<00:04:01.489> big

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
you're just going to wipe is it's no big

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.949 
you're just going to wipe is it's no big
deal<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:03.080> ultimately<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.680> think<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:05.630> should

have<00:04:06.260> almost<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.430> weird<00:04:07.940> kind<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.300> personal

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
have almost a weird kind of personal

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.720 
have almost a weird kind of personal
relationship<00:04:09.320> with<00:04:09.350> your<00:04:09.590> bottle<00:04:09.920> because

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
relationship with your bottle because

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.270 
relationship with your bottle because
you're<00:04:11.360> putting<00:04:11.480> products<00:04:11.930> in<00:04:12.110> here<00:04:12.410> you

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
you're putting products in here you

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.559 
you're putting products in here you
don't<00:04:13.430> need<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.580> shaker<00:04:13.819> bottle<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.180> water<00:04:14.300> and

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
don't need a shaker bottle of water and

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.220 
don't need a shaker bottle of water and
this<00:04:14.990> would<00:04:15.200> be<00:04:15.290> great<00:04:15.410> for<00:04:15.530> water

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
this would be great for water

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.930 
this would be great for water
but<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:16.950> don't<00:04:17.160> think<00:04:17.310> that's<00:04:17.520> what<00:04:17.610> people<00:04:17.670> are

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
