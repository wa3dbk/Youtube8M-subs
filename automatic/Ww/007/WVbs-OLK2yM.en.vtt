of<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:13.219> the<00:00:14.219> acoma<00:00:14.490> system<00:00:14.790> before<00:00:14.880> used

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
of all the acoma system before used

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.760 
of all the acoma system before used
armor<00:00:15.780> penetration<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.440> stuff<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.710> that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
armor penetration and stuff like that

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
armor penetration and stuff like that
our<00:00:17.220> penetration<00:00:17.699> pretty<00:00:18.240> much<00:00:18.449> decided<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
our penetration pretty much decided the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650 
our penetration pretty much decided the
damage<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.770> did<00:00:19.939> that<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.119> pretty<00:00:21.330> much<00:00:21.480> how

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it works now they've compressed it from

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.230 
it works now they've compressed it from
100<00:00:25.080> levels<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.439> comrades<00:00:25.859> back<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> 10<00:00:26.939> levels

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
in Sector one the guns will pretty much

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
in Sector one the guns will pretty much
be<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.489> similar<00:00:38.790> damage

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
be the same it will be similar damage

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
be the same it will be similar damage

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
higher level planets now there might be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
higher level planets now there might be
stronger<00:00:48.840> mobs<00:00:49.170> there's<00:00:49.890> gonna<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.129> mobs<00:00:50.399> like

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
stronger mobs there's gonna be mobs like

consider<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.430> bowl<00:01:38.790> starting<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> new<00:01:39.299> character

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
consider a bowl starting a new character

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
consider a bowl starting a new character
even<00:01:39.780> though<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.229> character<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.650> wiped<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
even though your character got wiped so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.649 
even though your character got wiped so
you're<00:01:41.579> probably<00:01:41.759> playing<00:01:41.970> new<00:01:42.240> character<00:01:42.570> by

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you're probably playing new character by

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.780 
you're probably playing new character by
now<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.170> you've<00:01:43.860> probably<00:01:44.100> experienced<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
now and you've probably experienced a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
now and you've probably experienced a
new<00:01:44.909> comment<00:01:45.270> system<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.899> might<00:01:46.049> be

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
new comment system and you might be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
new comment system and you might be
indifferent<00:01:46.439> about<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.220> might<00:01:47.369> be

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
indifferent about it like you might be

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
indifferent about it like you might be
confused<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> what<00:01:49.110> change<00:01:49.409> exactly<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
confused as to what change exactly and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
confused as to what change exactly and
stuff<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.780> not

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
stuff like that I know this is not

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
stuff like that I know this is not
really<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.170> video<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.590> oh<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:53.250> really

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
really a video like oh you're really

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
really a video like oh you're really
showing<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.000> off<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
showing it off right now it's more a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.459 
showing it off right now it's more a
talk<00:01:55.860> video<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.360> more<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> talk<00:01:58.020> video<00:01:58.290> where

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
talk video it is more a talk video where

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.010 
talk video it is more a talk video where
I<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.640> combo<00:01:59.939> system<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.869> make

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
I go over the combo system and they make

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
I go over the combo system and they make
sure<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.200> show<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.380> guys<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.829> ball<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
sure you show you guys the ball the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.459 
sure you show you guys the ball the
first<00:02:02.880> sector<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.110> give<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
first sector now it's actually give you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.069 
first sector now it's actually give you
an<00:02:04.560> idea<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> random

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
an idea like so this this is a random

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.619 
an idea like so this this is a random
planet<00:02:07.469> coaster<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.429> level<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.970> threat

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
planet coaster for that level one threat

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.570 
planet coaster for that level one threat
level<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.140> let's<00:02:10.739> go<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.099> beta<00:02:11.489> sector

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
level one let's go to a beta sector

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.330 
level one let's go to a beta sector
let's<00:02:12.850> go<00:02:13.030> over<00:02:13.150> here<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:14.320> level<00:02:14.470> two<00:02:14.770> so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
let's go over here to that level two so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.620 
let's go over here to that level two so
this<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.700> how<00:02:15.820> it's<00:02:16.000> going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.210> go<00:02:16.270> you're

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
this is how it's going to go you're

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.510 
this is how it's going to go you're
gonna<00:02:16.690> have<00:02:16.930> ten<00:02:17.140> sectors<00:02:17.470> at<00:02:17.770> some<00:02:17.950> point<00:02:18.220> and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
gonna have ten sectors at some point and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.280 
gonna have ten sectors at some point and
every<00:02:19.360> sector<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:19.870> gonna<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.140> one

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
every sector is just gonna have one

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.320 
every sector is just gonna have one
level<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:21.220> let's<00:02:21.700> go<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.060> over<00:02:22.300> to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
level now let's go all the way over to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.930 
level now let's go all the way over to
this<00:02:22.660> sector<00:02:23.080> which<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.040> Delta<00:02:24.250> sector<00:02:24.550> as

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
this sector which is the Delta sector as

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.210 
this sector which is the Delta sector as
you<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.570> see<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:25.930> threat<00:02:26.500> level<00:02:26.530> four<00:02:27.010> there

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
you can see here threat level four there

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.760 
you can see here threat level four there
will<00:02:27.340> be<00:02:27.520> nothing<00:02:27.790> above<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:29.200> level<00:02:29.380> for

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
will be nothing above that level for

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.590 
will be nothing above that level for
that<00:02:30.010> will<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.250> however<00:02:30.520> other<00:02:30.970> biomes<00:02:31.510> and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
that will be however other biomes and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360 
that will be however other biomes and
stuff<00:02:31.810> like<00:02:31.930> adding<00:02:32.230> here<00:02:32.440> which<00:02:32.890> makes<00:02:33.100> total

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
stuff like adding here which makes total

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.660 
stuff like adding here which makes total
sense<00:02:33.490> like<00:02:33.820> Phuket<00:02:34.390> magma<00:02:34.930> volcanic<00:02:35.830> jungle

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
sense like Phuket magma volcanic jungle

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.450 
sense like Phuket magma volcanic jungle
etc<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.390> then<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.260> cut<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.590> X<00:02:38.770> sector<00:02:39.190> now<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
etc and then we cut the X sector now the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.790 
etc and then we cut the X sector now the
X<00:02:39.730> sector<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> actually<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> sector<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.650> is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
X sector is actually a sector that is

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.700 
X sector is actually a sector that is
sort<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.430> placeholder<00:02:42.580> for<00:02:43.030> endgame<00:02:43.570> X<00:02:44.380> is

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
sort of a placeholder for endgame X is

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.020 
sort of a placeholder for endgame X is
not<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> sector<00:02:45.580> that's<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.970> be

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
not really a sector that's going to be

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.550 
not really a sector that's going to be
in<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.150> game<00:02:46.300> as<00:02:46.450> far<00:02:46.570> as<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.900> or<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.440> might

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
in the game as far as I go or it might

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.230 
in the game as far as I go or it might
actually<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> last<00:02:48.130> sector<00:02:48.430> which<00:02:49.030> makes

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
actually be the last sector which makes

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960 
actually be the last sector which makes
a<00:02:49.300> lot<00:02:49.420> more<00:02:49.450> sense<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.920> i'll<00:02:51.040> click<00:02:51.310> anything

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
a lot more sense but i'll click anything

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.180 
a lot more sense but i'll click anything
in<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.270> x-acto<00:02:52.600> right<00:02:52.780> now<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.860> planet

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
in the x-acto right now this planet

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.160 
in the x-acto right now this planet
costs<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.610> can<00:02:54.700> see<00:02:54.850> here<00:02:55.060> level<00:02:55.630> 9<00:02:55.810> and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
costs as you can see here level 9 and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.600 
costs as you can see here level 9 and
level<00:02:56.680> 5<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:59.200> basically<00:02:59.410> means<00:02:59.740> is<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
level 5 that basically means is that the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.430 
level 5 that basically means is that the
other<00:03:00.640> sectors<00:03:01.180> are<00:03:01.330> not<00:03:01.510> done<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.930> that

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
other sectors are not done and that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.320 
other sectors are not done and that
they're<00:03:02.590> mashing<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.550> other<00:03:03.850> remaining

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
they're mashing up the other remaining

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.620 
they're mashing up the other remaining
six<00:03:04.780> combat<00:03:05.290> levels<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:06.459> planets<00:03:07.000> in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
six combat levels in that planets in

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.930 
six combat levels in that planets in
that<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.140> whole<00:03:08.620> entire<00:03:09.040> system<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.880> how

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
that the whole entire system that is how

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.600 
that the whole entire system that is how
it<00:03:10.000> works<00:03:10.180> right<00:03:10.450> now<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:11.320> also<00:03:11.500> guys<00:03:11.830> if

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
it works right now so also guys if

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.310 
it works right now so also guys if
you've<00:03:12.910> not<00:03:13.060> been<00:03:13.209> play<00:03:13.390> stopping<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.959> good

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320

anymore and it's generally just gonna be

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.979 
anymore and it's generally just gonna be
a<00:03:26.769> good<00:03:27.100> time<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.180> penguin<00:03:28.330> UFO<00:03:28.780> can't

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
a good time like the penguin UFO can't

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.330 
a good time like the penguin UFO can't

show you guys now armor now also has HP

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.560 
show you guys now armor now also has HP
energy<00:03:40.959> rating<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:42.550> normal<00:03:42.940> armor<00:03:43.300> just

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
energy rating and this normal armor just

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.390 
energy rating and this normal armor just
the<00:03:43.810> armor<00:03:44.080> has<00:03:44.200> been<00:03:44.350> upped<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.800> it's<00:03:45.250> more

the armor has been upped and it's more
stat<00:03:45.760> wise<00:03:45.970> than<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.019> hole<00:03:47.380> 0<00:03:47.739> if<00:03:48.550> you

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
stat wise than just the hole 0 if you

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.130 
stat wise than just the hole 0 if you
meet<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.000> requirement<00:03:49.120> you're<00:03:49.810> not<00:03:49.989> gonna

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
meet this requirement you're not gonna

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.930 
meet this requirement you're not gonna
get<00:03:50.320> hit<00:03:50.530> as<00:03:50.650> much<00:03:50.830> you're<00:03:51.580> still<00:03:51.760> going<00:03:51.910> to

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
get hit as much you're still going to

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.759 
get hit as much you're still going to
get<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.239> shot<00:03:52.480> like<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.720> old<00:03:52.840> system<00:03:53.050> so<00:03:53.590> let's

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
get to shot like the old system so let's

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.470 
get to shot like the old system so let's
actually<00:03:53.890> look<00:03:54.100> at<00:03:54.310> my<00:03:54.430> armor<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:55.060> has<00:03:55.209> four

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
actually look at my armor it has four

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.780 
actually look at my armor it has four
energy<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.709> will<00:03:56.920> actually<00:03:57.040> contribute

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
energy so that will actually contribute

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.180 
energy so that will actually contribute
for<00:03:57.940> energy<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.420> my<00:03:58.540> bar<00:03:58.780> 19-month<00:03:59.650> but<00:04:00.040> we're

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
for energy to my bar 19-month but we're

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.590 
for energy to my bar 19-month but we're
not<00:04:00.340> gonna<00:04:00.459> work<00:04:00.790> in<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.030> ignore<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.450> one

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
not gonna work in that ignore the one

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.820 
not gonna work in that ignore the one
for<00:04:01.810> now<00:04:01.930> 100<00:04:02.769> defense<00:04:03.840> 250<00:04:04.840> defense<00:04:05.140> at<00:04:05.320> 400

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
energy regeneration as you can see which

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.900 
energy regeneration as you can see which
is<00:04:10.000> pretty<00:04:10.150> cool<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.980> 150<00:04:11.980> defense<00:04:12.310> so

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
is pretty cool and 150 defense so

is pretty cool and 150 defense so
they're<00:04:13.060> really<00:04:13.180> rolling<00:04:13.720> out<00:04:13.840> more<00:04:14.049> stats
