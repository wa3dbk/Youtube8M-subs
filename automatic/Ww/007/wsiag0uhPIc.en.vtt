when I used it that it felt amazing

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.900 
when I used it that it felt amazing
because<00:03:11.900> they're<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.500> cold<00:03:12.890> cuz<00:03:13.549> this<00:03:13.640> little

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
because they're so cold cuz this little

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.150 
because they're so cold cuz this little
rollerball<00:03:14.299> thing<00:03:14.630> gets<00:03:14.840> freezing<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.040> it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
rollerball thing gets freezing and so it

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.280 
rollerball thing gets freezing and so it
feels<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:16.970> nice<00:03:17.239> on<00:03:17.540> your<00:03:17.660> lips<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.109> think
