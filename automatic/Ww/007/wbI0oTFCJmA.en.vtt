plants<00:01:37.409> community<00:01:38.409> plan<00:01:38.650> is<00:01:38.860> good<00:01:39.190> I<00:01:39.369> think

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
plants community plan is good I think

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:50.350 
plants community plan is good I think
because<00:01:40.060> three<00:01:40.950> $300<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.190> not<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.400> matter<00:01:42.640> of

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.429 

first<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.350> need<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.650> select<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:52.040> plan<00:01:52.450> then

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.219 

you<00:01:59.950> know<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.369> select<00:02:00.880> license<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.450> mundo

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
you know to select license a mundo

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.679 
you know to select license a mundo
because<00:02:02.680> if<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.070> get<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.490> license<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.540> need

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
because if you get one license you need

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.590 
because if you get one license you need
to<00:02:04.840> pay<00:02:05.049> two<00:02:05.320> night<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.850> double<00:02:07.150> nine<00:02:07.270> dollars

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
to pay two night to double nine dollars

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.630 
to pay two night to double nine dollars
which<00:02:07.930> means<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.770> can<00:02:08.950> install<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.399> script
