00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.080
 well hello kids today a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.109
 new guitar course and for that 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 some very simple instruments 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.990
 firstly a guitar then the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.400
 guitar as acquired today it's 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.370
 a half-time explained that only one rope 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.289
 because not six not nice 3 p 19 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.330
 may only one rope preferably one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.430
 the six elected if you have me I'm going 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.990
 use the stick after something else that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.590
 we'll have it may seem 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.240
 strange but to each Olympic citrix 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.570
 right now 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 so if you dress up it does not bother 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.239
 onfray shirt and so if you have 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.710
 even more but we fled 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 now that you have that wooden 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 filion are today it's thunder 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.660
 struck by the big group ac / dc group 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.570
 european hard rock rather frankly 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.610
 recognized and this song the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 particularity of this fashion class 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.699
 still, but everyone thinks that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.039
 me it's to be ultra say I see the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 guitar and all that talk about it like a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.510
 kind of super stylish super solo actually 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.900
 no it's so simple 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.700
 so explained first thing a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.770
 guitar it takes a lot of gold distortion 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.530
 then turned the volume up game 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.790
 you started so you do not have 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 need your right hand so so if he 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.020
 admits she was carried away during a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 secondary sinking that that the case where the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.600
 food and it does not matter we're like 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 that we can put it in the back as 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 that and expensive redemption are so we go 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.820
 firstly use the first scheme that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.880
 is that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880
 m 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.750
 he him 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.200
 and so it's always the same 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.880
 schema that actually goes beyond just 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.110
 one box each time so you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.729
 put your finger on a fourth 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.409
 class of your unique rope so the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.030
 rope of 6 for those who will win six 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.210
 ropes and for the others just take it to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.009
 strings that is in the middle it's okay we 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 call super app the south form because 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.210
 we did not know how to scratch like you are 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.510
 usually take a dish if dadis 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.770
 no no no 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.460
 you just press very close with the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.760
 finger 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.960
 and then to do the you do this 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.789
 we call a little the guitar offer 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.970
 so support you very hard and iraq in 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.880
 low 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.830
 the instance does not judge that 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.540
 in the beginning you will have done well 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.410
 feel the feelings like that so it's 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.790
 for that he considers a lot 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.730
 distortion know a lot feel the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.350
 so are you doing so the names 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.310
 begin to blame manageable that you 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.060
 and it's the same with the little one 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.060
 finger to the tape 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.820
 and now you alternate between 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.820
 two 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.590
 yes a little how then started 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.250
 slowly at the beginning and that 's having two 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250
 months are well born 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.820
 not too much when even writer precedes the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.770
 reality and where to repeat this for about 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.850
 eight times I would say and then everything does 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.080
 the same thing but shifted from a breakage 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.440
 ie with the index on at 15.5 and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.440
 same thing 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.040
 again put x is a little heavy 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.040
 rotating 4 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.629
 it's as simple as that's his first 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.680
 diagrams after we will go on second 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.680
 schema I do you a little demo 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.760
 short so for this one again even 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.800
 principle each time we alternate with 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760
 open rope while relaxing but except 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.740
 that this time you start with 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.870
 these conventions is their equipment 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.870
 the ring finger is it you put there 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.900
 down like atari and you support it here and 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.930
 here at home then there 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.310
 so the cases these twelve here at ea is 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.440
 relax in quebec this time 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.140
 no 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.880
 10 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.510
 7 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.910
 9:05 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.560
 it is 4 5 4 1 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.730
 if ever there will be the table that will 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.640
 display above for you to see 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.050
 well this nightmare and that's after even 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.370
 thing you start slowly and if 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.470
 great lesson more just than these 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.090
 goals to sublimate a dancer and irvine 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.920
 and what unites it with this thing is that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.870
 unless you have your hand carried away 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.650
 by a shark or a jigsaw you 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.060
 can use to make others 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.060
 things at best worth it on his example 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.389
 Yes 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.389
 thank you 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.309
 obviously towards the sea ​​also if you 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.309
 please 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:09.570
 I like and maybe we're going 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.030
 not sing I think it's that he 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.240
 I would have the idea of ​​the end of the month to catch 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.700
 limits in the evening it's really not good 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.990
 so here it is very healthy really I 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.160
 mastery he fails to build yet in 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.530
 below a description to be well 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.780
 sure otherwise I strongly advise of 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:30.950
 do that with an electric guitar 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:34.010
 because the acoustic unit sarr means 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:39.930
 with a bass what the fuck 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:42.740
 it is filthy even and suddenly 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.930
 markets do not even please please 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.220
 there's not even this box 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.510
 and that's as simple as that 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.300
 take their guitars and raucous is 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.230
 despite all a last little tip if 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.490
 you never have an electric guitar 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.940
 conventional ie six 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.160
 ropes 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.720
 you 're going it works of course also 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.950
 obviously but problem is that you 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.210
 risk of having parasitic sounds because 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.630
 that you do not control your 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.140
 released douala like that and so you 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.140
 go in december 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.300
 it's so impressive 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.130
 hear said perfection behind 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.580
 so to avoid this infection you 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.840
 go take 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.160
 you will use month +13 can I 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.510
 know I said at the beginning of the video you 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.990
 will not use your right hand that 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.780
 unites unimat east united manistes satie 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.650
 the manist units we go out so if you 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.180
 still have a right hand 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.740
 you put your finger on the rope the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.730
 more acute in fact you're actually going 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.720
 blocked all the other strings with your 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.710
 fingers to prevent her from doing her 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.710
 and just leave this one there 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.249
 it's the saône is so blocked bag and 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.249
 we started again 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.730
 and as many see it, it makes 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.730
 trenec jump 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
 I 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.640
 2 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:00.969
 or 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.449
 and that's pretty much everything for 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.669
 today if you have any comments 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.990
 questions you have a small 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.159
 want to tell your life or so 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.680
 even insulted do it in the 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.680
 comments it's planned for that alteca
