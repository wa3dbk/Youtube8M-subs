easy<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:17.210> just<00:00:17.390> shouldn't<00:00:17.720> look<00:00:17.810> for<00:00:18.020> his

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110

body<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.590> straighten<00:00:18.890> out<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:19.340> that's<00:00:20.029> pretty

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
body to straighten out and that's pretty

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.330 
body to straighten out and that's pretty
much<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.540> release<00:00:20.990> point<00:00:21.259> and<00:00:21.529> he<00:00:22.009> can<00:00:22.160> pretty

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
much the release point and he can pretty

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.580 
much the release point and he can pretty
much<00:00:22.430> shoot<00:00:22.910> from<00:00:23.689> anywhere<00:00:24.050> in<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.230> court

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
much shoot from anywhere in the court

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.220 
much shoot from anywhere in the court
except<00:00:25.099> for<00:00:25.340> obviously<00:00:25.809> the<00:00:26.809> three-point

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
except for obviously the three-point

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.990 
except for obviously the three-point
range<00:00:27.470> now<00:00:27.860> I<00:00:27.890> think<00:00:28.070> he'll<00:00:28.399> get<00:00:28.520> that<00:00:28.759> in<00:00:28.910> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
range now I think he'll get that in the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.260 
range now I think he'll get that in the
future<00:00:29.149> he's<00:00:29.630> only<00:00:29.779> like<00:00:29.989> 23<00:00:30.919> 24<00:00:31.489> years<00:00:31.730> old<00:00:31.880> so

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
future he's only like 23 24 years old so

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.970 
future he's only like 23 24 years old so
I<00:00:32.480> think<00:00:32.930> would<00:00:33.200> definitely<00:00:33.559> develop<00:00:33.920> a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
I think would definitely develop a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.520 
I think would definitely develop a
deeper<00:00:34.250> jump<00:00:34.489> shot<00:00:34.730> in<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.420> future<00:00:35.809> but

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
deeper jump shot in the future but

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.500 
deeper jump shot in the future but
there's<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:36.950> variety<00:00:37.520> of<00:00:37.550> ways<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:38.000> use<00:00:38.210> him<00:00:38.360> in

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
there's a variety of ways to use him in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.470 
there's a variety of ways to use him in
the<00:00:38.540> game<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.340> unfortunately<00:00:40.340> 2k<00:00:40.940> does<00:00:41.270> not

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
the game and unfortunately 2k does not

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.450 
the game and unfortunately 2k does not
adhere<00:00:41.750> two<00:00:42.200> big<00:00:42.380> men<00:00:42.560> and<00:00:42.890> what<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:43.220> mean<00:00:43.400> by

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
adhere two big men and what I mean by

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.300 
adhere two big men and what I mean by
that<00:00:43.610> is<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.930> lot<00:00:45.200> of<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.380> bigger<00:00:45.650> guys<00:00:45.860> in

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
that is that a lot of the bigger guys in

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.120 
that is that a lot of the bigger guys in
the<00:00:46.430> game<00:00:46.610> plays<00:00:47.060> soft<00:00:47.530> they<00:00:48.530> do<00:00:48.590> not<00:00:48.829> finish

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
the game plays soft they do not finish

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.280 
the game plays soft they do not finish
well<00:00:49.460> at<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.760> rim<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.240> hopefully<00:00:51.079> that<00:00:51.260> is

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
well at the rim and hopefully that is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.920 
well at the rim and hopefully that is
addressed<00:00:51.800> for<00:00:52.010> 2k16<00:00:52.760> there's<00:00:53.630> not<00:00:53.870> enough

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
pretty nice job step on Whiteside to

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.629 
pretty nice job step on Whiteside to
believe<00:01:29.780> coming<00:01:30.170> up<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.189> know<00:01:31.429> it's<00:01:31.579> not

white sex Anderson but he pins him right

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.039 
white sex Anderson but he pins him right
under<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.549> rim<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:34.789> air<00:01:35.179> balls<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.600> slay<00:01:35.840> up

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
under the rim and air balls to slay up

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.050 
under the rim and air balls to slay up
and<00:01:36.229> that's<00:01:36.409> what<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.619> mean<00:01:36.889> big<00:01:37.549> men<00:01:37.759> do<00:01:37.880> not

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
and that's what I mean big men do not

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.419 
and that's what I mean big men do not
finish<00:01:38.389> well<00:01:38.749> around<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.170> rim<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:39.649> he<00:01:40.279> also

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
finish well around the rim but he also

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:41.980 
finish well around the rim but he also
you<00:01:40.639> can<00:01:40.789> take<00:01:40.999> guys<00:01:41.179> off<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.450> dribble<00:01:41.749> he's

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
you can take guys off the dribble he's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.139 
you can take guys off the dribble he's
actually<00:01:42.139> a<00:01:42.319> lot<00:01:42.439> faster<00:01:42.679> than<00:01:43.579> most<00:01:43.759> centers

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
actually a lot faster than most centers

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.120 
actually a lot faster than most centers
of<00:01:44.270> power<00:01:44.389> forward<00:01:44.959> so<00:01:45.289> he<00:01:45.859> has<00:01:45.950> better

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
of power forward so he has better

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.919 
of power forward so he has better
quickness<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.670> agility<00:01:46.880> than<00:01:47.299> both<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.659> them

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
quickness and agility than both of them

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.840 
quickness and agility than both of them
