the<00:02:07.649> numbers<00:02:07.890> down<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.869> fact<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.229> big

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the numbers down here of the fact is big

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.910 
the numbers down here of the fact is big
is<00:02:10.649> nice<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.489> easy<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:13.319> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
is nice it's easy to get to but on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
is nice it's easy to get to but on
it<00:02:14.880> doesn't<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.209> hit<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> graphic<00:02:15.810> style

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it doesn't really hit the graphic style

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.890 
it doesn't really hit the graphic style
it's<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> sleek<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.510> real<00:02:18.660> problem

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
it's not a sleek but the real problem

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.589 
it's not a sleek but the real problem
here<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.760> slide<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.480> more

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
here is then you slide it and it's more

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.210 
here is then you slide it and it's more
accurate<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.349> many<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.830> want<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.069> use

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
accurate for how many you want to use

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.430 
accurate for how many you want to use
but<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.540> want<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.780> slide<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.230> right

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
but if you want to slide to the right

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.559 
but if you want to slide to the right
more<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.459> do<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> slide<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.180> several

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
more you have to do a slide in several

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.910 
more you have to do a slide in several
times<00:02:27.750> which<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.349> longer<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.739> be

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
times which can take longer and be

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.199 
times which can take longer and be
harder<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.400> while<00:02:29.580> you're<00:02:29.700> playing<00:02:29.849> if<00:02:30.150> you

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
harder to do while you're playing if you

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.690 
harder to do while you're playing if you
want<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.510> fast<00:02:30.840> because<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.160> can't<00:02:32.580> just

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
want to be fast because you can't just

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.240 
want to be fast because you can't just
slide<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.000> up<00:02:33.090> all<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.270> way<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.810> swipe

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
slide it up all the way with one swipe

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.090 
slide it up all the way with one swipe
but<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.400> other<00:02:36.330> than<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> great

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
but on other than that this is a great

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.729 
but on other than that this is a great
app<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.239> lot<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.630> fun<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.470> got<00:02:40.590> some

better graphics you can see like the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.740 
better graphics you can see like the
reflections<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.750> ships<00:02:42.959> going<00:02:43.170> by<00:02:43.410> um
