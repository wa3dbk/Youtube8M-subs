00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.330
Crocus Thomasinianus

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.050
March is all about Spring bulbs.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.460
It's March thirteenth and I'm here in Connecticut
crouching down amongst a big patch of Crocus

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.000
thomasiniana which is a very early crocus.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.560
This is a very common color, the blue, purple
with white as the petals get near the base.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.460
Crocus thomasinianus is also one of the smaller
flowered crocus, two inches across.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.290
Some of the larger crocus hit three, three
and a half, four inches across and with many

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.770
different color selections.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.800
Crocus should be planted in September, early
October, in fairly well drained soil, you

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.470
don't want to put them in swampy soil, average
garden soil is good.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.650
As far as sun exposure goes, crocus are very
forgiving.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.040
Medium light shade, even full sun is ok.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.210
The bold initiates root growth in the fall
and then sleeps in the winter, with this chilling

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.800
requirements and then in the spring it sends
up the leaves and flowers.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.500
The leaves on Crocus thomasiniana are only
around until mid May and they don't get very

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.500
big.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.500
As the leaves are photosynthesizing and gathering
sunlight for it to produce food to get through

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.620
the next winter time it's best to have light
shade at best maybe full sun.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.980
What that means is you can grow many many
crocus varieties, most crocus varieties, under

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.140
deciduous trees, it's alright for them to
be shaded during the summertime after the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.909
crocus leaves die down.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.030
Oaks especially are later than many of the
maples and as the late winter and spring sunlight

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.050
penetrates to the forest floor it is a perfect
environment for Crocus and the snowdrops and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.790
many, many other types of bulbs.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.850
It's a great use of that space to create early
spring color.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.760
There are not many pests to worry about with
Crocus but there is a serious one that we

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.510
should talk about.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.620
Sciurus genus is the squirrel and they are
death to crocus.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.260
They will dig them up, pull them up, they'll
eat the bulb and leave the flowers laying

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.900
there.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.730
There are a couple things you can do.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.160
Crocus thomasiniana is the least susceptible
to squirrels.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.740
They don't seem to like the taste of that
bulb very much so if you have a lot of squirrels,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.349
first of all I would try planting that.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.569
Second of all you can plant your Crocus drifts
and cover them with chicken wire and then

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.290
mulch to cover the chicken wire.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.740
I highly recommend this.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.660
This is working for us at the gardens, works
for me home, and you will definitely not have

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.340
the problems with the squirrels digging them
up.
