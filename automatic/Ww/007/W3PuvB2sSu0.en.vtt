00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
brand new cameras so anyway let's get

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.480 
brand new cameras so anyway let's get
started

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.910 

so<00:01:31.329> anyway<00:01:31.810> there<00:01:31.990> wasn't<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.350> whole<00:01:32.380> lot<00:01:32.649> of

so anyway there wasn't a whole lot of

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.069 
so anyway there wasn't a whole lot of

the same 18 megapixel I believe CMOS

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.479 
the same 18 megapixel I believe CMOS
chip<00:02:28.299> which<00:02:29.049> is<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.500> fancy<00:02:29.709> way<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.160> saying

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
chip which is just a fancy way of saying

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.800 
chip which is just a fancy way of saying
that<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:32.319> has<00:02:32.650> no<00:02:33.040> image<00:02:33.430> density

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
that it really has no image density

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.479 
that it really has no image density
difference<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.500> quality<00:02:35.769> isn't<00:02:36.190> going

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
difference and the quality isn't going

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.880 
snapshot I believe that's what's called
and<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.750> where<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.109> can<00:02:50.290> take<00:02:50.500> four<00:02:50.859> or

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
and that is where you can take four or

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.880 
and that is where you can take four or
eight<00:02:51.489> second<00:02:52.030> cliffs<00:02:52.329> a<00:02:52.510> video<00:02:53.049> freeze

but<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.620> believe<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.370> sort<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.730> snapshot<00:02:58.150> mode

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.160 
but I believe in sort of a snapshot mode
of<00:02:59.489> some<00:03:00.489> form<00:03:00.819> so<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.450> way<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.840> can

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
of some form so that way you can

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.860 
of some form so that way you can
actually<00:03:03.040> get<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.760> bits<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.060> photo<00:03:04.359> as<00:03:04.660> you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
actually get little bits of photo as you

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.640 
actually get little bits of photo as you
take<00:03:05.079> video<00:03:05.440> I'm<00:03:05.680> not<00:03:06.640> entirely<00:03:07.000> sure<00:03:07.440> upon<00:03:08.440> it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
take video I'm not entirely sure upon it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.280 
take video I'm not entirely sure upon it
but<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:09.489> pretty<00:03:09.850> much<00:03:10.150> what<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.750> understand

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
but that's pretty much what I understand

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:21.540 
but that's pretty much what I understand
the<00:03:11.410> general<00:03:11.680> idea<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.819> process<00:03:13.389> is

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.490 
as well however I think most people will
be<00:03:44.710> turning<00:03:45.040> towards<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.850> body<00:03:46.570> only<00:03:46.870> version

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
be turning towards the body only version

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.250 
be turning towards the body only version
since<00:03:47.980> most<00:03:48.310> people<00:03:48.730> will<00:03:48.850> most<00:03:49.120> likely<00:03:49.420> have

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
since most people will most likely have

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.930 
since most people will most likely have
already<00:03:51.160> current<00:03:51.900> lenses<00:03:52.900> from<00:03:53.290> Canon<00:03:53.940> now
