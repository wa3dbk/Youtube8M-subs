and as a modern building there should be

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
and as a modern building there should be
an<00:00:40.920> openness<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.760> transparency<00:00:42.570> eliteness<00:00:43.820> use

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
an openness a transparency eliteness use

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.680 
an openness a transparency eliteness use
of<00:00:45.090> modern<00:00:45.510> materials<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> same<00:00:47.309> time

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
of modern materials but at the same time

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
of modern materials but at the same time
it's<00:00:48.690> Rome<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.710> Rome<00:00:50.239> was<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> city<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:52.110> stone

it's Rome and Rome was a city of stone

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.330 
it's Rome and Rome was a city of stone
of<00:00:53.219> travertine<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.870> travertine<00:00:55.289> seemed<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of travertine so travertine seemed to be

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.900 
of travertine so travertine seemed to be
as<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.090> Roman<00:00:57.449> stone<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.410> natural<00:00:59.250> material<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
as a Roman stone a natural material to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.979 
as a Roman stone a natural material to
also<00:01:00.329> use<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> glass<00:01:02.840> since<00:01:03.840> they

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
also use as well as the glass since they

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
also use as well as the glass since they
are<00:01:04.080> Apache<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.710> moved<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> site<00:01:05.700> since

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
are Apache was moved to this site since

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.130 
are Apache was moved to this site since
it<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:06.840> taken<00:01:07.500> from<00:01:07.530> another<00:01:07.920> location<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it was taken from another location and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
it was taken from another location and
relocated<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.010> seemed<00:01:11.400> appropriate<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
relocated here it seemed appropriate to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.830 
relocated here it seemed appropriate to
also<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:14.100> back<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.640> where<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
also then look back at where it was and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
also then look back at where it was and
find<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:17.909> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
find out you know what it was about that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.170 
find out you know what it was about that
place<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.650> also<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.909> sense

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
place that we could also in a sense

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.620 
place that we could also in a sense
relate<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.740> were<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.040> only<00:01:23.430> relating<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
relate to that were not only relating to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.190 
relate to that were not only relating to
the<00:01:24.869> present<00:01:25.470> situation<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.509> ARA<00:01:27.689> Pacis

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the present situation of the ARA Pacis

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.340 
the present situation of the ARA Pacis
but<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> sense<00:01:29.100> looking<00:01:30.030> back<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.540> even

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
but in a sense looking back to even

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
but in a sense looking back to even
before<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.390> order<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> try<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
before it was here in order to try to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.450 
before it was here in order to try to
bring<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.340> under<00:01:36.240> work<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
bring more of it here under work and to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.940 
bring more of it here under work and to
realize<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:40.170> life<00:01:40.470> moves<00:01:40.799> on

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
realize that this that life moves on

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.880 
realize that this that life moves on
first<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.450> portion<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:43.020> Rome<00:01:43.200> then

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
first it was in one portion of Rome then

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.260 
first it was in one portion of Rome then
here<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.450> has<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> new<00:01:46.729> museum<00:01:47.729> that's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
here and now it has a new museum that's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.179 
here and now it has a new museum that's
all<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> part<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.829> seems<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
all a part of that and it seems that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.999 
all a part of that and it seems that
that<00:01:50.490> was<00:01:50.670> appropriate<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> try<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:52.009> express

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that was appropriate to try to express

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.460 
that was appropriate to try to express
in<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> architecture<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.439> were

but<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.470> think<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.610> building<00:02:33.180> brings

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
but what I think this building brings

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.530 
but what I think this building brings
the<00:02:33.840> Rome<00:02:34.050> which<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.980> important<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.610> me<00:02:35.790> it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the Rome which is important to me it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.710 
the Rome which is important to me it
also<00:02:36.720> says<00:02:37.140> Rome<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.740> city<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:39.120> related

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
also says Rome is a city that is related

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.070 
also says Rome is a city that is related
to<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.080> 21st<00:02:40.740> century<00:02:41.030> it's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.210> only<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
to the 21st century it's not only a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.490 
to the 21st century it's not only a
museum<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.700> also<00:02:44.940> has<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> contemporary<00:02:46.230> life

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
museum it also has a contemporary life

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.030 
museum it also has a contemporary life
and<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.370> life<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.910> will<00:02:48.290> project<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.710> into<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
and a life that will project it into the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.240 
and a life that will project it into the
next<00:02:50.310> century<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:52.260> think<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.130> very

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
next century and I think that's very

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.270 
next century and I think that's very
important<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.030> well
