Kotwal<00:00:10.730> thus<00:00:11.730> far<00:00:11.969> we've<00:00:12.150> been<00:00:12.330> focused<00:00:12.750> on

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
Kotwal thus far we've been focused on

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.250 
Kotwal thus far we've been focused on
making<00:00:13.139> our<00:00:13.639> list<00:00:14.639> reader<00:00:14.910> app<00:00:15.179> beautiful<00:00:16.109> on

making our list reader app beautiful on

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990 
making our list reader app beautiful on
phones<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:16.920> haven't<00:00:17.250> really<00:00:17.550> looked<00:00:17.699> at

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
phones but we haven't really looked at

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.090 
phones but we haven't really looked at
the<00:00:18.090> tablet<00:00:18.330> side<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> things<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.619> let's<00:00:19.830> see

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the tablet side of things so let's see

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
the tablet side of things so let's see
if<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.910> take<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.270> app<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.720> we've<00:00:21.840> been

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
if we just take that app that we've been

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.170 
if we just take that app that we've been
using<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.439> far<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.310> put<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> tablet

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
using so far and and put it on a tablet

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.029 
using so far and and put it on a tablet
let's<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.720> looks<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.920> have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
let's see what it looks like so we have

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
let's see what it looks like so we have
a<00:00:26.070> nexus<00:00:26.430> 10<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> app<00:00:27.269> running<00:00:27.630> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
a nexus 10 here with the app running and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.599 
a nexus 10 here with the app running and
you'll<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.279> particularly

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you'll see it's not particularly

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339 
you'll see it's not particularly
attractive<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.330> all<00:00:30.449> there's<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.230> this

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
attractive at all there's all this

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
attractive at all there's all this
wasted<00:00:31.769> white<00:00:31.980> space<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.700> hand

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
wasted white space on the right hand

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
wasted white space on the right hand
side<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> detail

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
side and then when I go into the detail

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.840 
side and then when I go into the detail
view<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> text<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.500> edge<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.010> edge<00:00:38.190> sure

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
view the text is going edge to edge sure

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310 
view the text is going edge to edge sure
the<00:00:39.000> fonts<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.450> nice<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.899> we've<00:00:39.989> we've

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the fonts are nice and we've we've

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
the fonts are nice and we've we've
modernized<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.219> action<00:00:41.520> bar<00:00:41.670> but

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
modernized it with an action bar but

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.200 
modernized it with an action bar but
this<00:00:42.450> isn't<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> great<00:00:43.020> tablet<00:00:43.260> experience<00:00:44.210> so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this isn't a great tablet experience so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910 
this isn't a great tablet experience so
let's<00:00:45.780> switch<00:00:45.899> back<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> slides

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
let's switch back to the slides

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
let's switch back to the slides
let's<00:00:47.700> talk<00:00:47.969> about<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
let's talk about what we can do and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139 
let's talk about what we can do and
really<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.980> obvious<00:00:50.370> thing<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
really the obvious thing to do in this

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.900 
really the obvious thing to do in this
situation<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.410> implement<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.309> two-pane<00:00:53.879> UI

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
situation is to implement a two-pane UI

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.180 
situation is to implement a two-pane UI
so<00:00:54.870> we're<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.469> from<00:00:55.710> something<00:00:56.070> like

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so we're going to go from something like

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
so we're going to go from something like
what<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:58.050> something<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
what you see here to something like this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
what you see here to something like this
where<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.609> have<00:01:00.090> both<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> list<00:01:00.780> items<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
where we have both the list items on the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
where we have both the list items on the
left<00:01:01.859> hand<00:01:02.010> side<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> detailed<00:01:02.969> items<00:01:03.300> on

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
left hand side and the detailed items on

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
left hand side and the detailed items on
the<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.780> hand<00:01:04.080> side<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:05.640> going

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the right hand side the way we're going

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.960 
the right hand side the way we're going
to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.530> try<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
to do that is we're going to try and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.690 
to do that is we're going to try and
basically<00:01:08.970> keep<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:10.409> reuse<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.250> much<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
basically keep or reuse as much as the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
basically keep or reuse as much as the
code<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.180> possible<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.689> don't<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> write

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
code as possible we don't want to write

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
code as possible we don't want to write
a<00:01:13.409> phone<00:01:13.770> version<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> tablet<00:01:14.610> version<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
a phone version and a tablet version of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.039 
a phone version and a tablet version of
the<00:01:15.180> apps<00:01:15.299> that's<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.930> build

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the apps that's not how you build

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.830 
the apps that's not how you build
Android<00:01:16.710> apps<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
Android apps so we're going to use a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
Android apps so we're going to use a
little<00:01:19.110> trick<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.530> called<00:01:22.549> XML

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
little trick that we called XML

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.070 
little trick that we called XML
references<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> let's<00:01:25.590> look<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> code<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
references so let's look at the code on

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.200 
references so let's look at the code on
on<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.920> machine<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:30.229> we<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:32.040> our<00:01:32.210> two

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
on on my machine here we we have our two

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
on on my machine here we we have our two
activities<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.070> list<00:01:35.340> activity<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
activities the the the list activity and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
activities the the the list activity and
the<00:01:36.329> detail<00:01:36.689> activity<00:01:36.900> well<00:01:37.770> you'll<00:01:37.890> notice

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the detail activity well you'll notice

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
the detail activity well you'll notice
we've<00:01:38.310> also<00:01:38.490> got<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> layout<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
we've also got a layout here for a to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.499 
we've also got a layout here for a to
paint<00:01:40.229> activity<00:01:40.740> now<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> load<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
paint activity now one way to load this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.870 
paint activity now one way to load this
is<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.170> load<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.880> initial

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
is that when we load the initial

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
is that when we load the initial
activity<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> list<00:01:45.659> activity<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.619> could<00:01:46.860> just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
activity the list activity we could just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.859 
activity the list activity we could just
at<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.399> point<00:01:47.579> work<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.299> whether<00:01:48.570> we're<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
at that point work out whether we're a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
at that point work out whether we're a
tablet<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> load<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> two<00:01:51.509> pane

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
tablet or not and load the two pane

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.300 
tablet or not and load the two pane
layout<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.130> we're

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
layout we're not going to do that we're

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
layout we're not going to do that we're
going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> use<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.850> nice<00:01:54.119> references<00:01:54.869> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
going to use this nice references this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
going to use this nice references this
XML<00:01:56.159> references<00:01:56.640> trick<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> particularly

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
XML references trick but I particularly

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
XML references trick but I particularly
like<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.250> we're<00:01:59.430> still<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.119> load

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
like so we're still going to load

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.120 
like so we're still going to load

Refs XML file and that name isn't

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.260 
Refs XML file and that name isn't
special<00:02:11.030> we're<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.209> calling<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.660> that

have our two pane UI of course this is
all<00:04:00.100> based<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.730> assumption<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.240> you<00:04:01.390> are

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
all based on the assumption that you are

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840 
all based on the assumption that you are
already<00:04:01.959> using<00:04:02.230> fragments<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.400> you're<00:04:03.640> not

already using fragments if you're not

already using fragments if you're not
using<00:04:04.090> fragments<00:04:04.720> in<00:04:04.780> your<00:04:04.900> app<00:04:05.110> already<00:04:05.650> I

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
using fragments in your app already I

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.250 
using fragments in your app already I
think<00:04:06.430> you're<00:04:06.880> making<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.209> mistake

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
think you're making a mistake

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.229 
think you're making a mistake
it's<00:04:08.620> it's<00:04:09.130> really<00:04:09.520> important<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.090> do

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
it's it's really important that you do

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.110 
it's it's really important that you do
so<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.600> allows<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.800> make<00:04:12.070> these<00:04:12.850> apps

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
so it allows you to to make these apps

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.229 
so it allows you to to make these apps
really<00:04:13.570> flexible<00:04:14.110> depending<00:04:15.040> on<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.790> form

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
really flexible depending on the form

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.970 
really flexible depending on the form
factor<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.870> you'll<00:04:17.290> see<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.620> did<00:04:17.770> it<00:04:17.859> with

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
factor and you'll see we did it with

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.990 
factor and you'll see we did it with
minimal<00:04:18.370> effort<00:04:19.080> so<00:04:20.080> let's<00:04:20.109> switch<00:04:20.350> back<00:04:20.500> to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
minimal effort so let's switch back to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.930 
minimal effort so let's switch back to
to<00:04:22.000> our<00:04:22.290> our<00:04:23.290> slides<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.950> what<00:04:24.340> we'll<00:04:24.520> see<00:04:24.550> now

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
to our our slides and what we'll see now

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.070 
to our our slides and what we'll see now
we've<00:04:25.210> got<00:04:25.360> our<00:04:25.450> nice<00:04:25.630> two-pane<00:04:26.080> UI<00:04:26.110> great

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
we've got our nice two-pane UI great

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.929 
we've got our nice two-pane UI great
but<00:04:27.590> one<00:04:27.770> thing<00:04:27.979> that's<00:04:28.159> still<00:04:28.220> lacking<00:04:28.789> here

00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:28.939 
but one thing that's still lacking here

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.749 
but one thing that's still lacking here
is<00:04:29.150> spacing<00:04:29.449> that<00:04:30.199> those<00:04:31.069> margins<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.699> we

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
is spacing that those margins that we

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.339 
is spacing that those margins that we
specified<00:04:32.270> on<00:04:32.419> either<00:04:32.629> side<00:04:32.960> for<00:04:32.990> the

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
specified on either side for the

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.320 
specified on either side for the
detailed<00:04:33.740> view<00:04:33.830> they<00:04:34.550> don't<00:04:34.729> seem<00:04:35.060> as

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
detailed view they don't seem as

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.770 
detailed view they don't seem as
applicable<00:04:35.629> for<00:04:36.259> a<00:04:36.740> tablet<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.389> fact<00:04:38.599> even

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
applicable for a tablet and in fact even

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.559 
applicable for a tablet and in fact even
now<00:04:38.900> ListView<00:04:39.439> seems<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.770> little<00:04:39.860> bit<00:04:40.129> squashed

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
now ListView seems a little bit squashed

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.990 
now ListView seems a little bit squashed
more<00:04:42.259> so<00:04:42.409> than<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.710> should<00:04:42.919> be<00:04:43.099> so<00:04:43.669> what<00:04:43.819> we're

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
more so than it should be so what we're

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.969 
more so than it should be so what we're
going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.300> do<00:04:44.479> is<00:04:44.689> actually<00:04:44.870> we're<00:04:45.740> going<00:04:45.770> to

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
going to do is actually we're going to

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.040 
going to do is actually we're going to
go<00:04:46.069> and<00:04:46.340> override<00:04:46.879> some<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.210> those<00:04:47.389> values<00:04:47.840> for

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
go and override some of those values for

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.240 
go and override some of those values for
tablets<00:04:48.469> so<00:04:48.889> switching<00:04:49.129> back<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.580> code

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
tablets so switching back to the code

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.179 
tablets so switching back to the code
you'll<00:04:52.250> recall<00:04:52.819> that<00:04:53.060> we<00:04:53.210> had<00:04:53.590> dimensions<00:04:54.590> XML

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189 
you'll recall that we had dimensions XML

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.240 
you'll recall that we had dimensions XML
file<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.819> we'd<00:04:55.969> specified<00:04:56.569> for<00:04:57.199> our<00:04:57.469> list

views<00:04:58.490> we'd<00:04:58.729> had<00:04:58.939> some<00:04:59.180> top<00:04:59.569> and<00:04:59.719> bottom

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960

margins and for our detailed view we had

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.020

some margins on on either side what

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.580 
some margins on on either side what
we're<00:05:05.180> going<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.419> do<00:05:05.599> is<00:05:05.780> specify<00:05:05.990> another

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
we're going to do is specify another

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.300 
we're going to do is specify another

and<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.960> don't<00:05:12.139> care<00:05:12.319> whether<00:05:12.469> it's<00:05:12.590> portrait

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
and we don't care whether it's portrait

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.430 
and we don't care whether it's portrait
or<00:05:13.190> landscape<00:05:13.340> we're<00:05:13.729> going<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.030> use<00:05:14.440> these

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.950 
or landscape we're going to use these
dimensions<00:05:15.979> and<00:05:16.129> instead<00:05:16.699> of<00:05:16.819> 8<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.240> 16<00:05:17.690> we're

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
dimensions and instead of 8 and 16 we're

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.320 
dimensions and instead of 8 and 16 we're
going<00:05:18.199> to<00:05:18.289> go<00:05:18.379> 16<00:05:18.889> dips<00:05:19.219> vertically<00:05:19.849> for

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
going to go 16 dips vertically for

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.140 
going to go 16 dips vertically for
margin<00:05:20.750> for<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.080> ListView<00:05:21.529> and<00:05:21.710> 80<00:05:22.550> dips<00:05:22.909> on

margin for the ListView and 80 dips on
either<00:05:23.779> side<00:05:24.279> so<00:05:25.279> now<00:05:25.430> let's<00:05:25.639> switch<00:05:25.789> back<00:05:25.849> to

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
either side so now let's switch back to

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.969 
either side so now let's switch back to
slides<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.719> see<00:05:26.870> what<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.229> will<00:05:27.439> actually

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
slides and see what that will actually

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.129 
slides and see what that will actually
end<00:05:28.939> up<00:05:29.090> achieving<00:05:29.539> this<00:05:29.629> is<00:05:29.750> what<00:05:29.870> we<00:05:29.960> have

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
end up achieving this is what we have

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.309 
end up achieving this is what we have
now<00:05:30.379> when<00:05:31.219> we<00:05:31.370> put<00:05:32.180> those<00:05:32.389> new<00:05:32.690> margins<00:05:33.139> in

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
now when we put those new margins in

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.649 
now when we put those new margins in
we've<00:05:33.800> got<00:05:34.039> much<00:05:34.250> better<00:05:34.430> spacing<00:05:34.849> vertically

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
we've got much better spacing vertically

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.330 
we've got much better spacing vertically
between<00:05:35.840> our<00:05:36.139> list<00:05:36.349> items<00:05:36.680> on<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.919> left<00:05:37.129> and

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
between our list items on the left and

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.670 
between our list items on the left and
on<00:05:37.819> either<00:05:38.180> side<00:05:38.569> in<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.870> detailed<00:05:39.259> view<00:05:39.349> as

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
on either side in the detailed view as

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.730 
on either side in the detailed view as
well<00:05:39.860> so<00:05:40.759> with<00:05:41.300> that<00:05:41.419> being<00:05:41.629> said<00:05:41.750> we've<00:05:42.560> now

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
well so with that being said we've now

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.469 
well so with that being said we've now
come<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.009> the<00:05:43.219> end<00:05:43.250> of<00:05:43.669> this<00:05:43.849> check<00:05:44.210> point

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
come to the end of this check point

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.320 
come to the end of this check point
which<00:05:45.110> is<00:05:45.349> this<00:05:46.069> is<00:05:46.219> where<00:05:46.400> we<00:05:46.520> started<00:05:47.000> with

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
which is this is where we started with

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.600 
which is this is where we started with
our<00:05:47.509> tablet<00:05:47.750> app<00:05:48.050> not<00:05:48.710> very<00:05:48.949> attractive<00:05:49.219> at

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
our tablet app not very attractive at

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.390 
our tablet app not very attractive at
all<00:05:49.759> and<00:05:49.969> this<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.449> where<00:05:50.629> we've<00:05:50.779> come<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.400> so

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
all and this is where we've come to so

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.600 
all and this is where we've come to so
the<00:05:53.240> next<00:05:53.479> part<00:05:54.319> we're<00:05:54.650> going<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:54.979> focus<00:05:55.069> on

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
the next part we're going to focus on

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.659 
the next part we're going to focus on
performance<00:05:55.969> tuning
