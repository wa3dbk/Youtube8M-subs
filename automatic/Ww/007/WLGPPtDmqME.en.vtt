00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.400 
would actually do i do the single attack
about<00:03:56.519> four<00:03:56.760> times<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.570> will<00:03:57.720> use<00:03:57.900> up<00:03:57.930> all

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
about four times so it will use up all

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.790 
about four times so it will use up all
my<00:03:58.760> energy<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.170> also<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.230> guys<00:04:01.350> notice<00:04:01.680> only

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
my energy and also you guys notice only

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.630 
my energy and also you guys notice only
have<00:04:01.950> 32<00:04:02.190> ki<00:04:02.489> should<00:04:02.610> be<00:04:02.820> above<00:04:03.260> 45<00:04:04.260> k<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:05.220> I

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
have 32 ki should be above 45 k but I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.060 
have 32 ki should be above 45 k but I
don't<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.060> chems<00:04:06.269> right<00:04:06.450> now<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.470> yeah

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
don't have the chems right now so yeah

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.900 
don't have the chems right now so yeah
so<00:04:08.519> what<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.790> guys<00:04:08.880> really<00:04:09.180> want<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:10.019> do<00:04:10.170> is

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
so what you guys really want to do is

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.780 
so what you guys really want to do is

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
attack four times gets your speak up and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.490 
attack four times gets your speak up and
afterwards<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.660> can<00:04:15.750> keep<00:04:15.900> attacking<00:04:16.200> you

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
afterwards you can keep attacking you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.360 
afterwards you can keep attacking you
want<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.769> conserve<00:04:17.100> your<00:04:17.549> hero<00:04:18.299> energy<00:04:18.720> or<00:04:19.370> you

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
want to conserve your hero energy or you

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.240 
want to conserve your hero energy or you
could<00:04:20.549> basically<00:04:20.750> max<00:04:21.750> attack<00:04:22.109> now<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:23.100> I

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
could basically max attack now if if I

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.770 
could basically max attack now if if I
do<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.520> correctly<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.240> should<00:04:24.600> save<00:04:24.870> 1<00:04:26.539> 150<00:04:27.539> k

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
do this correctly I should save 1 150 k

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.820 
do this correctly I should save 1 150 k
energy<00:04:28.110> since<00:04:28.820> if<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.910> do<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:30.240> 20<00:04:30.510> 20<00:04:30.780> k<00:04:30.930> i'm

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
energy since if I do like 20 20 k i'm

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.110 
energy since if I do like 20 20 k i'm
actually<00:04:31.980> just<00:04:32.280> wasting<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.730> money<00:04:32.760> so<00:04:33.090> i

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
need i think i actually might go for

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.670 
need i think i actually might go for
first<00:06:14.580> if<00:06:15.300> i<00:06:15.570> stay<00:06:15.810> up<00:06:15.960> long<00:06:16.200> enough<00:06:16.320> because

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
first if i stay up long enough because

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.020 
first if i stay up long enough because
i'll<00:06:16.770> just<00:06:16.919> be<00:06:17.010> killing<00:06:17.250> monsters<00:06:17.430> and<00:06:17.970> i

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
think a lot about 20 million points and

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.460 
think a lot about 20 million points and
i<00:06:20.280> think<00:06:20.789> i<00:06:20.880> can<00:06:21.060> actually<00:06:21.210> uh<00:06:21.419> well<00:06:22.080> it<00:06:22.320> is<00:06:22.440> a

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
i think i can actually uh well it is a

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.830 
i think i can actually uh well it is a
mexican<00:06:23.010> so<00:06:23.310> people<00:06:24.120> usually<00:06:24.240> do<00:06:24.660> the

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
mexican so people usually do the

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.940 
mexican so people usually do the
Treasury<00:06:25.320> but<00:06:26.190> see<00:06:26.729> anyways<00:06:27.500> solo<00:06:28.500> events

this<00:06:29.250> is<00:06:29.370> what<00:06:29.520> happened<00:06:30.140> second<00:06:31.140> again<00:06:31.850> so<00:06:32.850> um

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
this is what happened second again so um

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.240

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
I don't know what happens maybe like all

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.980 
I don't know what happens maybe like all
the<00:06:44.670> kingdoms<00:06:45.030> do<00:06:45.150> not<00:06:45.330> get<00:06:45.510> the<00:06:45.720> same<00:06:45.870> amount

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
the kingdoms do not get the same amount

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.160 
the kingdoms do not get the same amount
of<00:06:46.290> monsters<00:06:46.680> or<00:06:46.860> what<00:06:47.040> but<00:06:47.640> I<00:06:48.090> made<00:06:48.660> sure<00:06:48.690> I

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
of monsters or what but I made sure I

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.410 
of monsters or what but I made sure I
had<00:06:49.260> had<00:06:49.560> a<00:06:49.590> whole<00:06:49.800> Alliance<00:06:50.270> finding<00:06:51.270> me<00:06:51.450> the

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
had had a whole Alliance finding me the

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.850 
had had a whole Alliance finding me the
level<00:06:54.420> five<00:06:54.600> or<00:06:54.900> six<00:06:55.140> monsters<00:06:55.350> everywhere

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
level five or six monsters everywhere

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.030 
level five or six monsters everywhere
and<00:06:56.250> I<00:06:56.550> literally<00:06:56.910> killed<00:06:57.210> each<00:06:57.420> one<00:06:57.720> and<00:06:58.410> I

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
and I literally killed each one and I

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.710 
and I literally killed each one and I
didn't<00:06:59.460> kill<00:06:59.580> a<00:06:59.610> few<00:06:59.790> level<00:07:00.120> four<00:07:00.360> so<00:07:00.570> I<00:07:00.630> think

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
didn't kill a few level four so I think

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.450 
didn't kill a few level four so I think
I'm<00:07:00.870> gonna<00:07:01.050> wipe<00:07:01.500> out<00:07:01.680> all<00:07:01.920> the<00:07:02.040> monsters

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
I'm gonna wipe out all the monsters

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.580 
I'm gonna wipe out all the monsters
since<00:07:03.270> level<00:07:03.450> for<00:07:03.780> sale<00:07:04.080> of<00:07:04.230> older<00:07:04.470> is

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
since level for sale of older is

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.590 
since level for sale of older is
basically<00:07:05.040> won't<00:07:05.220> hit<00:07:05.400> anyway<00:07:05.730> so<00:07:05.790> more
