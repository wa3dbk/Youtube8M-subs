plays in the rough with tumble when the
story<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.020> pretty<00:04:47.050> simple<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.270> know<00:04:49.660> I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840

certain amount of gears which would like
open<00:05:09.280> doors<00:05:09.520> but<00:05:09.700> didn't<00:05:10.150> get<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.450> only

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
open doors but didn't get to the only

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600 
open doors but didn't get to the only
level<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:11.050> mean<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:11.530> rescue<00:05:11.919> all<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.220> Winx<00:05:12.550> and

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
level I mean a rescue all the Winx and

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.580 
level I mean a rescue all the Winx and
they<00:05:12.760> level<00:05:13.060> obviously<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:14.020> basically<00:05:14.350> you

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
they level obviously so basically you

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.100 
they level obviously so basically you
need<00:05:14.800> 100%<00:05:15.340> this<00:05:15.669> game<00:05:15.880> for<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.780> make<00:05:16.900> any

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
need 100% this game for it to make any

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
need 100% this game for it to make any
sense<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:17.770> even<00:05:17.950> beat<00:05:18.310> it<00:05:19.650> anyway<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:20.710> as

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
sense like to even beat it anyway so as

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.630 
sense like to even beat it anyway so as
we<00:05:21.340> go<00:05:21.910> through<00:05:22.120> this<00:05:22.180> door<00:05:22.450> here<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:23.830> yes<00:05:24.160> it's

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
we go through this door here it yes it's

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.610 
we go through this door here it yes it's
it's<00:05:24.880> for<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.270> kids<00:05:25.660> game<00:05:25.750> it's<00:05:26.140> very<00:05:26.410> very

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
it's for a kids game it's very very

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.800 
it's for a kids game it's very very
difficult<00:05:27.060> because<00:05:28.060> at<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.360> camera<00:05:28.690> not

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
difficult because at the camera not

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.530 
difficult because at the camera not
saying<00:05:29.560> why<00:05:29.650> here<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.520> I'm<00:05:31.120> about<00:05:31.240> to

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
saying why here is the I'm about to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.810 
saying why here is the I'm about to
enter<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:32.669> wanted<00:05:33.669> hide<00:05:33.910> X<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:35.820> yeah

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
enter the wanted hide X so yeah

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.429 
enter the wanted hide X so yeah
basically<00:05:37.030> we<00:05:37.510> don't<00:05:37.690> need<00:05:38.050> to

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439 
basically we don't need to

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.040 
basically we don't need to
we'll<00:05:39.159> be<00:05:39.369> on<00:05:39.399> yet<00:05:39.729> Dan<00:05:40.179> in<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.360> next<00:05:40.599> part

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
we'll be on yet Dan in the next part

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.479 
we'll be on yet Dan in the next part
anyway<00:05:41.589> so<00:05:41.649> this<00:05:41.769> has<00:05:41.919> just<00:05:42.009> been<00:05:42.189> a<00:05:42.249> quick

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:46.869 
actually know what we'll do is we will

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:48.629 
actually know what we'll do is we will
enter<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:47.619> also<00:05:47.860> have<00:05:47.949> to<00:05:48.069> make<00:05:48.219> sure<00:05:48.339> we<00:05:48.580> were

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
enter and also have to make sure we were

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.449 
enter and also have to make sure we were
using<00:05:48.939> speed<00:05:49.269> axe<00:05:49.479> to<00:05:50.199> speed<00:05:50.469> up<00:05:50.649> that<00:05:50.830> there

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:51.459 
using speed axe to speed up that there

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:53.639 
using speed axe to speed up that there
we<00:05:51.519> go<00:05:51.989> we're<00:05:52.989> going<00:05:53.019> to<00:05:53.169> be<00:05:53.229> using<00:05:53.439> speed

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
we go we're going to be using speed

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:55.559 
we go we're going to be using speed
hacks<00:05:53.889> to<00:05:54.459> double<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:54.939> speed<00:05:55.149> when<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:55.389> gets

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
hacks to double the speed when it gets

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.029 
hacks to double the speed when it gets
to<00:05:55.659> like<00:05:55.689> our<00:05:55.959> through<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.379> Emporium<00:05:56.769> it's

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
to like our through the Emporium it's

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.070 
to like our through the Emporium it's
because<00:05:57.249> like<00:05:57.339> this<00:05:57.519> game<00:05:57.729> just<00:05:57.999> slow<00:05:58.839> down<00:05:58.869> a

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
because like this game just slow down a

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.329 
because like this game just slow down a
little<00:05:59.229> bit<00:05:59.349> so<00:05:59.619> anyway<00:05:59.800> this<00:05:59.919> is<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.099> hub

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.339 
little bit so anyway this is the hub

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.399 
little bit so anyway this is the hub

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
area you get the dream keys and you step

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.189 
area you get the dream keys and you step
on<00:06:02.559> this<00:06:02.709> and<00:06:03.779> you<00:06:04.779> know<00:06:05.279> a<00:06:06.389> big<00:06:07.389> blue<00:06:07.689> green

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:13.739 
can see so that is the Z's keep your

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
there it needs stuff with us for each

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.979 
there it needs stuff with us for each
level<00:06:18.369> this<00:06:18.610> green<00:06:18.879> purple<00:06:19.269> and<00:06:19.509> blue<00:06:19.839> or

then<00:06:23.259> there's<00:06:23.529> lies<00:06:23.919> which<00:06:24.339> is<00:06:24.489> the<00:06:24.610> picture

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
then there's lies which is the picture

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.609 
then there's lies which is the picture
of<00:06:24.969> the<00:06:25.059> thing<00:06:25.269> the<00:06:25.479> wink<00:06:25.719> which<00:06:26.079> is<00:06:26.199> there<00:06:26.379> the

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:26.619 
of the thing the wink which is there the

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.679 
of the thing the wink which is there the
rough-and-tumble<00:06:26.919> coins<00:06:27.579> which<00:06:27.849> collect<00:06:28.539> in

rough-and-tumble coins which collect in

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.409 
rough-and-tumble coins which collect in
ten<00:06:29.079> eleven<00:06:29.409> gives<00:06:29.589> me<00:06:29.709> extra<00:06:29.889> life<00:06:30.419> there's

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
ten eleven gives me extra life there's

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.509 
ten eleven gives me extra life there's
the<00:06:31.539> gears<00:06:31.779> and<00:06:32.139> then<00:06:32.289> there's<00:06:32.499> the<00:06:32.709> drain

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:33.519 
the gears and then there's the drain

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.179 
the gears and then there's the drain
things<00:06:33.879> which<00:06:34.089> shoot<00:06:34.599> stuff<00:06:34.959> like<00:06:35.139> this<00:06:35.319> basic

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:36.189 
things which shoot stuff like this basic

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.389 
things which shoot stuff like this basic
circle<00:06:36.579> so<00:06:36.729> X<00:06:37.209> is<00:06:37.509> to<00:06:37.689> attack<00:06:38.009> circles<00:06:39.009> dislike

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:39.399 
circle so X is to attack circles dislike

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.519 
circle so X is to attack circles dislike
while<00:06:39.610> moving<00:06:39.969> and<00:06:40.119> so<00:06:40.479> pressing<00:06:41.019> circle

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:41.529 
while moving and so pressing circle

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:43.570 
while moving and so pressing circle
wadhwa<00:06:41.889> nothing<00:06:42.279> would<00:06:42.550> do<00:06:42.909> that

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
wadhwa nothing would do that

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.090 
wadhwa nothing would do that
X<00:06:43.910> then<00:06:44.240> Square<00:06:44.660> will<00:06:44.930> be<00:06:45.080> like<00:06:45.260> excellent

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
X then Square will be like excellent

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.470 
X then Square will be like excellent
