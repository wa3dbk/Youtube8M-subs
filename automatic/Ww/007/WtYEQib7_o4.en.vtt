this is basically um I think this is
your<00:03:01.380> history<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.190> I'm<00:03:02.490> correct<00:03:02.850> if<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:03.660> not

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
your history if I'm correct if I'm not

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.140 
your history if I'm correct if I'm not

favorites for some reason I don't know
why<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.739> think<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.859> adds<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.430> feed<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.810> fine

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
why I think it adds to the feed it fine
