00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.690
 amazing the last week Friday across the floor of the large halls on 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.770
 Fürstengraben was crawling or crawling behind it 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.820
 here were in the context of the eu project locomotive different animals similar 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.759
 Running robot tested 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.230
 Demonstrations like the Rosensäle visitors Holmes Meetings 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 a meeting of an eu project TuS Hasloh com on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.999
 and the aim of this project is probably to develop a clear robotics platform 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.009
 to be able to reproduce the movement of humans and animals we are 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.890
 Three stations are being set up so that one of his stations has the titles like 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 Oh analyze so know exactly where that will make you in the clinic 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740
 is called in the meal d movement of 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.220
 the segment will ban the east and west forces to the federal parliament 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.250
 can tell which energy which power of the robot 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.650
 the second will be Poco where we will try the robustness of the robot opposite 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.680
 Slope to measure it was mine 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.240
 built a Toko where it gets steeper and just look away when the CBOE 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000
 that says now it is no longer possible 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.540
 and it put Super CUDA so it's also about overall lateral stability 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.159
 So the ground is constantly changing so this is a very uneven one 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.730
 the sighting art was derived locomotive 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 that had the project members with the locomotives so the 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.970
 Locomotion and morphology so the physique 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.400
 the question is how the physique affects the movement 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 For example, the body movements were analyzed by animal-like robots 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.510
 a dog of a crab or a spider-like walking robot at the moment 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.240
 White is so nimble that not only we every now and then had more with him 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.910
 to capture the camera 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.010
 but also the course of sick animals in the course was probably the University of Jena 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.250
 examined 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 this time some bully in front of botters of experts from Toronto can both on 4 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.080
 as well as walking on three legs 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.870
 So the euro or the one running behind me is a robber of kidnapping 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.010
 is involved 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.420
 Condor and the based on commercial Northeim that means this mod or the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.340
 You can buy speakers you can buy 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.250
 and the idea is to have the four-legged reported to us $ end up 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.700
 the condition that has a leg 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 not working it would be six men back to 109 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.370
 where we already do not care or change if you 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.830
 Cheeky amputation has and how would it be legs on the World Cup 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.620
 a good tool Cyndi Lauper Botter for the development of prostheses 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.769
 because you can use robots to check beforehand if it's technically possible at all 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.759
 is possible 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:23.549
 we can be curious what running robot in the context of locomotives 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.269
 will arise
