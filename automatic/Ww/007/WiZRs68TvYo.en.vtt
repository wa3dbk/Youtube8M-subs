 movements 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.540
 you on the rules of the road too 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.490
 give the twin cottage cheese that is the lamp 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.810
 dim light but how did you take not that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.530
 it is near or far as well as 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:11.020
 identify the lamp ride it went from 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.880
 very many paws and you do not even 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.990
 you can determine where it is suddenly 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.910
 distant suddenly it's closer 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.740
 This is clearly visible see here with 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.550
 hand, you can see that the car is a car 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.280
 black you can see whether you can not 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.900
 because you are not a specialist you are this 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.500
 you didn't build a car in this factory 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.000
 worked 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
 See me also saw it myself 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.380
 of course though why me a near caesar 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:47.980
 and because this car is because you 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:50.050
 know locality provided 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.090
 do not crush the factory lam dipped headlights 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.410
 I will tell you exactly here everything is worth 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.410
 automatically also females at my car 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.420
 contract is nothing better 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.760
 they fly 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.350
 communicate show approached introduced you 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:26.290
 here it is here I argue you we do not argue 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.600
 on the man say what I stopped 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.340
 what they argue 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:39.130
 just saying with confidence I say that 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:41.920
 this key dimensions and it is on your 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.170
 the instrument can even be distinguished 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.319
 what exactly was burning really real 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.730
 let's not say so 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.620
 even if it comes to that all soon 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.090
 forget we can produce produce 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.370
 how would experiment such a small 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.790
 the twins will ride and then no 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.250
 victory and what I do not understand you can not 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.409
 leave over i 'm i 'm saying how can this 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 all things therefore ambiguous not to solve 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:18.880
 she is me on the pack you have to work in 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.009
 General driver, I think I understand that 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.870
 I need he did not know the beard trip 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.880
 now there will be no problems I think 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.690
 them and neither but since the inspector 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.000
 stopped 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.729
 and maybe you thought that really 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 something is wrong no problem i think i 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.479
 I think that our given fence will work 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.430
 and it's better for me and for the driver that I 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.430
 you are even more personally believed 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.449
 good bye 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.600
 talked in fact he himself does not speak 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.160
 me some 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.520
 the whole topic is closed
