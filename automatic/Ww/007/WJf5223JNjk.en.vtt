00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to do well you know you can't just run -

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
to do well you know you can't just run -
evolving<00:00:46.710> together<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:48.920> not<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.100> what's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
evolving together and not know what's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.180 
evolving together and not know what's
going<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.700> around<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:53.809> decided<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.190> slow

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
going on around you so I decided to slow

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.049 
going on around you so I decided to slow
my<00:00:56.370> pace<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.090> bit<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:59.059> see

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
my pace down a little bit you know see

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.340 
my pace down a little bit you know see
what<00:01:00.090> comes<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> me<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.899> think<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.080> kind

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
what comes to me and I think it's kind

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
what comes to me and I think it's kind
of<00:01:04.409> working<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:07.020> can't

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
of working out I you know I really can't

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
of working out I you know I really can't
run<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> gun<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.070> game<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.000> get

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
run a gun in this game I just get

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.340 
run a gun in this game I just get
totally<00:01:09.810> annihilated<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.760> I<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.350> slowing

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
totally annihilated and I think slowing

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
totally annihilated and I think slowing
slowing<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.890> pace<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.000> comes<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
slowing your pace down see what comes to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.200 
slowing your pace down see what comes to
you<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.520> knowing<00:01:17.520> what's<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.060> around

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you and knowing what's going on around

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.380 
you and knowing what's going on around
you<00:01:18.540> could<00:01:18.810> definitely<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
you could definitely be the
