00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there's going to be HD capability but

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.770 
there's going to be HD capability but
already<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.430> spice<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.880> starting<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> sound

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
already the spice is starting to sound

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.399 
already the spice is starting to sound
pretty<00:01:49.049> cool<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> be

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
pretty cool so it's going to be

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
there's only really two devices out that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.660 
there's only really two devices out that

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
device a lot more now and hopefully they

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.520 
device a lot more now and hopefully they
improve<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.450> web<00:04:04.600> browser<00:04:04.870> if<00:04:05.080> well<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.410> mean

really look like a tabloid if you really

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.270 
really look like a tabloid if you really
think<00:04:33.660> about<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.990> though<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:34.710> not<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.009> tablet

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
think about it though it's not a tablet

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.700 
think about it though it's not a tablet
is<00:04:35.550> far<00:04:35.759> from<00:04:35.970> it's<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.509> gaming<00:04:36.870> device<00:04:36.990> but

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
is far from it's a gaming device but

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.439 
is far from it's a gaming device but
it's<00:04:37.830> starting<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.190> match<00:04:38.370> up<00:04:38.669> with<00:04:38.819> tablet<00:04:39.240> so

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
it's starting to match up with tablet so

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.900 
it's starting to match up with tablet so
I<00:04:39.479> really<00:04:39.750> hope<00:04:39.780> they<00:04:40.050> not<00:04:40.949> only<00:04:41.130> make<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.699> a

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
I really hope they not only make it a

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.510 
I really hope they not only make it a
awesome<00:04:42.539> gaming<00:04:42.810> experience<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.979> fairly

well internet experience is well on the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.140 
well internet experience is well on the
device<00:04:46.770> because<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.430> could<00:04:47.580> certainly<00:04:47.759> see

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
device because I could certainly see
