00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 year 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 wanted to show that our releases 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
 of a mainly which is a microphone 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.000
 digital that we are launching here 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 In Namm I wanted to show you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.239
 Let's go here first and show it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.239
 of one that is the leak here of that slit 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 then this one is one and if this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.550
 new digital microphone from a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.039
 it operates at the frequency of 2.4 then 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 the license-free frequency when 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.280
 You go to the event and you do not need 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.010
 request the release of the license to use and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.500
 free license and it's also made for 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.619
 have no configuration whatsoever to be a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.010
 thing to use at any level 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.500
 technician uses this microphone he is very 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.369
 simple when it arrives it scans the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.590
 environment 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.110
 You push that button, Daddy, he 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.900
 is automatically thinks his country after 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.180
 he sucks it constantly 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.490
 scanning an environment 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 so it always leaves a frequency of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.430
 backup ready for example here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.590
 that I take fair that is full of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.360
 wireless microphones full of wifi 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.780
 thing in this region 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.909
 if he feels he will be suffering 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.270
 some kind of interference it does the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 frequency hop né it automatically 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 changes frequency and does not let it fail 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.560
 He also has several cool things. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 it connects to ipad software and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.810
 not only ask, you can have all the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.799
 setting it apart from the microphone 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 digital 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.129
 it offers an equalizer of seven 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.770
 bands he offers one of s 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.900
 he has a super legal that is fit 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.629
 automatic cover sensitivity 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.939
 the singer can scream can talk down 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.170
 that it automatically adjusts to that 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.750
 level and compensates at the output and aquino - 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.989
 You do not want to do it for the ipad is a 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.079
 super simple menu he has all 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.620
 these gifts of equalizing everything 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:38.970
 so he already has a few presets for you 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.489
 It's a voice and a guitar if you avoid it. 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.359

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.129
 frequency coordination or scan a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.760
 environment 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.609
