00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
thing I noticed with this flat twist

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.549 
thing I noticed with this flat twist
versus<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.129> regular<00:00:49.460> Platts<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:51.020> have<00:00:52.020> much<00:00:52.289> for

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
versus my regular Platts I have much for

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
versus my regular Platts I have much for
shrinkage<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:55.850> braids<00:00:56.850> or

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
shrinkage because with a a braids or

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.549 
shrinkage because with a a braids or
plants<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> tendency<00:00:59.129> to<00:01:00.379> stretch<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
plants it has a tendency to stretch the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
plants it has a tendency to stretch the
hair<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.039> more<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
hair a little bit more so this is a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.859 
hair a little bit more so this is a
little<00:01:03.600> shorter<00:01:04.110> than<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.799> used<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.220> but

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
little shorter than what I'm used to but

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
little shorter than what I'm used to but
i<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.409> i<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.860> try<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.220> again<00:01:08.580> until<00:01:09.450> i

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
i think i will try this again until i

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.580 
i think i will try this again until i
feel<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.799> least<00:01:11.450> mastered<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
feel like i have at least mastered the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.920 
feel like i have at least mastered the
art<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.880> doing<00:01:15.509> flat<00:01:15.840> twists<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.509> i'm<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.930> to

I'm<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> nervous<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:42.409> think<00:01:43.409> I'll<00:01:43.560> start

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I'm kind of nervous I think I'll start

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.399 
I'm kind of nervous I think I'll start
with<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:45.440> lifting<00:01:46.440> first<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.479> then<00:01:48.479> I'll

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
with just lifting first and then I'll

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.149 
with just lifting first and then I'll
take<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.830> look<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.430> i<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:53.030> then

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
take a look at what i have and then

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:06.020 
take a look at what i have and then
separate<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.690> needed

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.120

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
it's really a shame I've been natural

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.670 
it's really a shame I've been natural
this<00:02:08.280> long<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.200> never<00:02:10.200> tried<00:02:12.260> flat<00:02:13.260> twisting

this long and never tried flat twisting
my<00:02:13.800> hair<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.490> what<00:02:14.940> gave<00:02:15.180> me<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.420> idea<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.870> try

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
my hair but what gave me the idea to try

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.610 
my hair but what gave me the idea to try
it<00:02:16.290> was<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.430> watched<00:02:18.560> mahogany<00:02:19.560> knots<00:02:19.819> she<00:02:21.620> did

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it was I watched mahogany knots she did

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.510 
it was I watched mahogany knots she did
um<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.459> video<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:25.470> too<00:02:25.650> long<00:02:25.770> ago<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.040> couple<00:02:26.280> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
um a video not too long ago a couple of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.970 
um a video not too long ago a couple of
days<00:02:26.940> ago<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.270> think<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.660> was<00:02:27.720> where<00:02:28.170> she<00:02:28.440> was

days ago I think it was where she was

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.240 
days ago I think it was where she was
doing<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> flat<00:02:29.520> twist<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.060> she<00:02:30.360> demonstrated

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
doing a flat twist and she demonstrated

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.059
