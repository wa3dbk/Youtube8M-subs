00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello everyone as always weave 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.860
 pigtails today i 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.959
 show you enough again 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.110
 complicated looking hair but she does 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.510
 very simple and now I’m different again 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.529
 dummy promise you somehow show 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.289
 all on the real model but so far 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.779
 so we brush our hair today 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.150
 we do with you celtic knot i think 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.220
 many of you have heard it even 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.590
 have seen but how is nobody done 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.840
 has i'll show you how his first 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.870
 just tie on your hair and then 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.899
 your variations on how you can 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.539
 from which strands quantity and so on in 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.850
 general complications can always be what we 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.609
 with you doing combed our model 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.550
 hair should be long that is here 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.530
 look my hair is about 60 70 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.809
 centimeters and they ate not 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.629
 tied up ie long hair on 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.219
 short you do not tie this 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.170
 select two strands between them 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.299
 necessarily have to be the distance 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 have they should not come from one 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.390
 point you otherwise fail to take one 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.659
 left-handed and see what I'm with her 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.210
 I will do this hold 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.820
 this show could move here I take 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.189
 I bend the strand of my right hand 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.640
 it turned out such a loop 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.409
 loop now I'll fix this 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.060
 the main element of our celtic 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.430
 knot 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.310
 now i take 2 strand clamp i will remove 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.100
 without clamping it’s possible 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.750
 straight so rovnenko all I got so 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.299
 we corrected now take this one 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.909
 second strand and what am i doing i don't 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.860
 impose a loop look at me 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.469
 surely it should be visible 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.049
 like a bagel and then some kind of crosshair 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.040
 so here now this piece i 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.189
 throwing over 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.380
 through here through my left hand and here 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.399
 from here it should appear to me that is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.770
 with this hand 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.009
 a little hard but you adapt myself 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.570
 how do you guarantee we take out 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.960
 pulled out to see now what 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.000
 It turned out right here this whole 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.550
 design by no means chong 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.680
 omit in no case look 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.590
 be sure to keep that loop 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.070
 under it is this thing now that I am 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.360
 doing this piece here this piece 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.280
 I first put on a loop then me here 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 this is a loop it just needs me 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.750
 I put a piece of my own this strand 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.959
 under and now again saw above 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.620
 look under the top here it is on top 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.290
 goes and down there goes all the girls 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.420
 we are a Celtic knot 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.330
 Well done to you now I'll fix it to you 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.870
 here that here everything is big you will be shot 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.510
 here we see such a Celtic knot 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.300
 It turned out that is what can be done 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.760
 further after this further you can 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.709
 take either strands and right here I see 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.870
 took a strand from her right almost from the top 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.090
 one could actually take 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.280
 from here but why not even show 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.500
 It became the majority of models, this one 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.239
 part for sheared especially if you 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.790
 take the girl out a little shorter 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.070
 hair u not necessarily go there 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.140
 and well, you can’t tie it if u 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.200
 girls really long hair like a 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.049
 I can now take my hair right 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.060
 from here you can do more 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.880
 then we can tie another one 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.380
 the celtic knot is already lower here these strands and 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.900
 do not even touch these tails 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.780
 they will not cut you have a look 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.150
 how much here rugged design 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.340
