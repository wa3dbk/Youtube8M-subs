00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 the tone 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.580
 Hi guys, you are going to learn how to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.560
 to make carrot cakes crepe gets a lot 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.289
 and whoever has teaching you are the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.990
 my sister and my grandmother but I'm here 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.550
 To tell you, you explain everything, and I want to. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 that the recipe will be written with 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 all the measurements and all the details 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.890
 here in the description of that video then to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.820
 anyone who wants to do everything will be here 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 down 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.329
 So let's talk to the mass at 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.570
 first thing we will add 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.070
 a glass of oil in the blender is there 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.600
 four eggs 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
 We already bought the eggs that are one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 they gave themselves two gems with 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.320
 double gems but there are four works that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.530
 are you there? 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 and finally four medium sized carrots 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 so small and we add in the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 blender and now it's just you beating 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.799
 until a homogeneous mixture is 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 everything is more or less the same and there 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.210
 You pass this to another bowl. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 that we are going to hit then in that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.380
 another bowl we add two 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.479
 cups sugar mix a little 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.600
 now adds two of flour 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.600
 wheat 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.630
 and two tablespoons of yeast 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.100
 now it 's just you mixing everything in hand 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.100
 even until a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 Now we'll see with the mixer. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.250
 even want to assign those small pieces 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.560
 carrots and to make the mixture stay 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.810
 even with even mass texture 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 So that's the point that 's what's for 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.880
 stay 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.470
 now as I was in the middle 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.190
 that we were at the house of the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.500
 my grandmother 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.990
 We even got a spoonful of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.770
 Ice cream is for her to go and there she goes 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.840
 It 's pretty cool in the camping grounds. 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.600
 you use this technique that looks good 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.030
 right after completing all the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.850
 people in the oven that suffocate 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.350
 was preheated to 180 degrees and people 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.110
 will leave in the oven for more or less 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.940
 about 30 minutes but of course you have 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.190
 to do that test before the toothpick 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.380
 to see if you are already at the right point but the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.600
 ours about 30 and 35 minutes 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.550
 in total 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.410
 while waiting the 30 minutes to pass 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.060
 people are getting ready to cover 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.070
 It will be a brigadeiro that the Brigadier 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.019
 bit different then to start 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.100
 where you add a can of milk 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.280
 condensed half a cup of milk 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.930
 cup cream 4 tablespoons 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.489
 chocolate soup and finally a 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.350
 tablespoon margarine 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.140
 So you mix everything up before you plug the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.030
 fire and then connecting the fire and will making 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.790
 until you reach the point of Brigadeiro and 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.380
 rise significantly as you can see but 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.910
 then it goes back down 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.190
 So you just stop fiddling when 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.690
 the point when it is in the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.480
 The point is that we pass through another 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.610
 container and give a thermal shock and gives 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.500
 A cold one we put inside 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 another container with ice and water 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.910
 so to take a peek 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 after thirty minutes play 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.459
 to remove the capitals from within 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.459
 oven 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.819
 and it's time to put our coverage 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.470
 in the balls 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.390
 So it 's normal to have these 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.280
 confetti that is specific for this 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.950
 these nozzles as soon as you leave the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.379
 format and used one of those to 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.239
 cover all the cookies and 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:39.010
 there it is quite right there is not that one 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.010
 problem falling out or anything 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.049
 so they all stayed like this 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.280
 and for us to give the final touch affirms 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.280
 brought these little girls so they 're kind 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.770
 sugars and then she graced 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.170
 to give a special touch is not 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.150
 that thing only the little ones and can stay 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.140
 The way you want to be beautiful 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:12.120
 Any way, then, is your result, I hope. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.069
 much that you have enjoyed is not 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.500
 forget that I liked it if you liked it 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.329
 comment below what do you think of 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.959
 recipes that we make more videos of 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.959
 recipe 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.030
 A super kiss, I'll see you guys next time.
