00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 well if everyone knows sycamore 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.330
 we find ourselves for a new record 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.200
 strategic on because every round or 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.869
 kercha crocs 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
 it depends on your pronunciation but 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 in any case it's a pokemon of the 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.919
 fourth generation currently over 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.010
 you do 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.560
 I will not talk about his mega 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 evolution but we'll talk about the stats of 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.390
 because each wheel has a very good 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.010
 attack 130 a good speed for lover 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.980
 uses his 2 which allows him especially 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.740
 to overtake the mega station to see my 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.680
 xy charioteer guy or even megache 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.240
 armina he also has a good ability to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 to cash the shots so this is a 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.390
 pokemon who had to bolt thanks to his good 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.220
 pv 108 and correct defenses he has 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 however an average special attack 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.650
 80 that we will still try 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 to exploit with hard skin blast 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
 his talent would be more appropriate a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.159
 defensive pokemon but may prove to be a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.110
 team especially to inflict damage 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.179
 pokemon wanting to turn back 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.789
 his other talent fable veil is 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.609
 forbidden because it increases the dodge under 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.780
 the sandstorm 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.850
 concerning weaknesses and resistance 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.130
 2 because each wheel has a double title 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.009
 is interesting immunity to the type 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 electric teams teams 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.829
 based on the turn-around chrono change 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.409
 clear does not like because every row 3 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.659
 interesting resistance fire poison and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.819
 rock so because every wheel takes only 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.130
 6% on the rock traps it's 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.069
 important to point it out and three 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.579
 dragon ice weaknesses in x 4 and since 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.369
 the sixth generation does we will talk 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.560
 now 17 2 because every wheel and the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.319
 handkerchief set choosing a classic 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.659
 it allows to exceed my guys 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.399
 Draco Felix Me Equalizer or even 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.469
 mega intensive shots after a dance 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.690
 draco and with regard to nature 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.960
 it's jovial if you do not use 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.900
 deflagration otherwise it's naive 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.540
 the distribution while attacking while 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.630
 speed so 250 had to attack 250 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.370
 had to speed and the four years pdci 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.340
 you play it jovial otherwise it's in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.470
 attack this earthquake it's the ground staple that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 you will find especially the 7.2 because 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.530
 each anger wheel especially when the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.540
 facts and steels without removing the soul 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.880
 pure rock toguy son loved yaping cyr 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.250
 and finally braquo claw or double vaf the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.590
 power and the double leads me to a 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.930
 little less accurate but double sloppy 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 in two strokes with the first shot 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.480
 break the clown and the second inflict 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.210
 blast damage alas for the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.950
 steels and armor that would hang out and 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.190
 finally, alas for the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.990
 facts much rarer but we can 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.600
 also play it with the choice headband 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.000
 with a jovial nature same breakdown 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.430
 same attack without blast because 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.910
 he is jovial and deflagration 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.770
 is not boosted by the headband choice 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.690
 because each rock rest so we go 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.850
 to be able to play it in lead of a card 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.780
 addicted will be so the first pokemon 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.120
 sent to fight 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.400
 we have two objects for this set the belt 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.980
 force to be sure they place the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.050
 th2 rock or the crude helmet to inflict 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.750
 damage to other lead as 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.400
 put your roth or field kyo nature 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.740
 naive is there to troubleshoot rations for 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.150
 hurting ar wall and our steel and the 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.160
 four relays attacking this point 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.920
 precisely there for blast the rest 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.350
 does not change but of stable earthquake and 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.780
 anger or draco crif the choice of the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.990
 power to anger or the ability to 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.370
 to be able to switch with braquo grid because 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.840
 each wheel can also pose the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.120
 rock without being sent first to 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.280
 fight and with his stats we can in 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.320
 to make an offensive rock poser with 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.270
 the abbot green to cure a status I 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.400
 think about the burn or their 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.900
 quote for the power a new 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.030
 times distribution and nature 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.800
 choose according to blast 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.230
 if you integrate it or not into your 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.300
 four attacks if you choose in 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.760
 I highly recommend that you 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.230
 raco grid will tap you enough 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.930
 strong and you will not be blocked 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.810
 unlike anger one can also 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.100
 play a set with soul dance and 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.840
 only three offensive attacks 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.660
 here cros fire is here for air wall is 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.630
 drowned after a dance the 100th of rock 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.420
 you have a 53% chance of killing a wall 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.960
 in two shots and kill you in one shot 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.880
 noah if the rock donkey and there like for 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.370
 the previous seven for toby keith and 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.450
 for my guys what reminded a 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.670
 variant of the previous set 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.430
 you keep both stab attacks and to 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.290
 know earthquake braquo griffo anger and 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.060
 you play cloning cloning can 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.860
 allow one because each wheel of 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.230
 place more easily with lane dancing 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.220
 is behind you making big holes 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.280
 in the opposing team and finally a set 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.300
 more defensive because as I say because 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.480
 each wheel and a bruegel 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.060
 with these good pvc defense so we can 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.490
 to make a defensive set the castres goal is 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.200
 here nice because combined with his talent skin 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.030
 hard because each wheel can hurt a lot 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.090
 pokemon attacking on the physical 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.220
 without even launching attac and nature 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.930
 malin will increase the defense at 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.620
 detriment of a special attack here 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.850
 useless 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.370
 we will invest 250 vpv 250 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.410
 had to defend to keep up the 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.840
 costs on the physical plane and the four 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.240
 last in attack we will be able to place 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.220
 rock with this because every role at a 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.020
 keeps an earthquake for poison steels 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.480
 that we could not poison 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.470
 with toxic and draco that is there for 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.210
 prevent the opponent from standing 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.580
 especially for this quarter sacred too 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.920
 I advise the lucky guy as a partner 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.360
 because he has access to aromatherapy for 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.180
 to deal with possible status problems 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.950
 but mostly wants to regenerate because 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.290
 every rocard this one has no 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.570
 self attacks nymph ali can 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.150
 also do it so we go 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.820
 now go to the counter and 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.550
 Czech 2 because each wheel with particular 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.920
 to wall that I quoted many times 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.080
 excellent defense immunity sol 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.240
 dragon resistance thanks to this type steel 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.540
 and can prevent because every wheel of 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.090
 rank with cyclone tanguay who 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.560
 also he has immunity to both 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.420
 stages of because each wheel so if you 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.480
 do not have the soul of rock because every wheel 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.460
 will be harmless especially guise and in 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.640
 rust finland and transmitters host and 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.070
 has access to intimidation to lower his 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.230
 attack he has an immunity to the ground team and 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.860
 the defensive as very well the versions 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.500
 2 because every wheel he can not get 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.050
 place so we saw the Czech lands 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.210
 of addicted card let's see the partners 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.430
 who would be able to eliminate these 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.640
 threats to the latter 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.530
 so I chose 3 ly tran all 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.110
 first because it classifies the rocks and can 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.510
 thus provide offensive support but 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.370
 also intranets a double resistance to 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.290
 Icy weakness made of because every 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.140
 wheel and dragons resistance which 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.419
 can be very interesting magnesium him 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.220
 thanks to his talent can trap the 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.350
 steels that would be likely to 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.290
 annoying because each wheel and with these 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.000
 steel attacks he can tap the facts 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.160
 and finally tons of russia he can animate 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.530
 he can eliminate air wall with thunder 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.720
 our steel with focus black you focus 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.780
 blast by the ngo so explodes force in 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.110
 French and can bring a big 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.340
 offensive pressure to Latin 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.050
 so that's about the 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.680
 partners of because every re you can 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.290
 find others 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.270
 I quoted c36 as I quoted the three 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.460
 others against 2 because each messenger rom 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.820
 sachets so that there are 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.190
 other 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.710
 and here we are at the end of this 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.600
 video I hope this one to you all 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.340
 do not hesitate to show me 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.020
 leaving a little blue thumb or a 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.409
 comment in commentary space 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.389
 necessarily and to share 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:00.399
 for cause to make known and for 

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:02.169
 know all the card sets addicted to 

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:04.529
 the east it was sycamore everyone in 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.529
 the next
