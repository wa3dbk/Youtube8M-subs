 Today, the toy to look at is voiced by Vortex toys finally arriving 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.779

 Last time I spoke briefly at the end of Tong Mae Card News . 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:29.189

 There are three of them up to Taff Kai . 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.880
 As with the Virtex-no siryeo top toy plane first two starters in the lungs 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.280
 You have to buy one of the worlds. There's a toy that can turn the top. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 You'll have to refer to it. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:21.810
 Here's the booster pack . Let's see it. Here's a top and a figure. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 And it's literally a booster pack in less than two toys that can turn your birthday 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.290
 It was. 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.939
 Looking at the back of the box, it is expected that some toys will come out, 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.189
 And Booster Peca 2 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:52.649
 You know what the difference is, let 's see . 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:58.229
 It's a mini battle pack 3g that contains a mix of kai and cyclo. 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.210
 Now, as we have two Cai and two Cycles, 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.750
 It contains two toys that can 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.799
 Now, literally put the 2 Starter Pack Starter Pack and Sea cycles in one package 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.390
 I got it. 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:16.920
 When you have children you'll have already bought your purchase Battle Pack 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 Mini-battle packs to be released with toys that can play together 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 Because 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:28.349
 Now, you can see here that there are Cai and Cyclo. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.700
 Now, next to the power control, 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:37.650
 There is another stronger power control audience . 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.870
 I buy the two requirements I have to get along for very haha 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.019
 It's a song. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.470
 I'll show you something while reviewing it. 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.920
 sleep 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.550
 Next up is the Vortex Space Gift Pack. 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.310
 You can see the contents of the box by looking at the back of the box. 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.170
 Other party to four mini-launcher and two chairs and a tarp Kai shoots after cycle 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.730
 The figures and example 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 There is a plate that can be used as a space bar 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:14.370
 Itneyo example, as to the party and party points Coin stickers showed earlier 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:17.670
 Mini battle packs go differently here. There are four Vortex toys. 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.070
 I have two mini launchers. 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:26.820
 You can think of it as a pack that four people can play with. 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:32.160
 Here are the Space Arena and Warp Arena toys. 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.090
 I think that it is the battle board which can do the battle by turning the action 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.010
 You can. 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:42.560
 You can combine them in this way to finish the battle tag in 3 levels. 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.740
