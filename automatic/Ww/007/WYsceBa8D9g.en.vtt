cycles around between the time the date
and<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.930> temperature<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.130> say<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.430> to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
and the temperature you can say that to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.860 
and the temperature you can say that to
centigrade<00:03:21.150> or<00:03:21.330> Fahrenheit<00:03:22.110> oh<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.600> talks

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
centigrade or Fahrenheit oh and it talks

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.530 
centigrade or Fahrenheit oh and it talks
as<00:03:28.140> well<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.820> get<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.360> play<00:03:30.480> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
as well and you can get it to play a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.690 
as well and you can get it to play a
number<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.959> different<00:03:31.350> nature<00:03:31.860> type<00:03:32.100> sounds

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
number of different nature type sounds

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.789 
number of different nature type sounds
either<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:34.019> alarms<00:03:34.799> or<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.269> countdown<00:03:36.690> timer

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.650 

so<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.220> good<00:03:41.430> alarm<00:03:41.880> clock<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:42.360> I'm<00:03:42.450> sure

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
so it's a good alarm clock but I'm sure

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.030 
so it's a good alarm clock but I'm sure
what<00:03:42.840> you're<00:03:42.989> really<00:03:43.230> interested<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.769> finding

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
what you're really interested in finding

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.009 
what you're really interested in finding
out<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.370> how<00:03:44.610> good<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.120> our<00:03:45.480> being<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.780> spy

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
out is how good it is our being a spy

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.930 
out is how good it is our being a spy
camera<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.620> let's<00:03:46.829> use<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.519> remote<00:03:47.700> control

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
camera so let's use this remote control

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
camera so let's use this remote control
to<00:03:48.390> turn<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:48.959> top<00:03:49.470> left<00:03:49.680> though<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.860> got

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
to turn it on top left though you got

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.590 
to turn it on top left though you got
power<00:03:50.250> then<00:03:50.579> you've<00:03:50.700> got<00:03:50.850> motion<00:03:51.209> activation

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
power then you've got motion activation

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.410 
power then you've got motion activation
video<00:03:52.110> record<00:03:52.530> still<00:03:53.130> photo<00:03:53.459> or<00:03:53.850> sound

about 12 hours at least in my test it

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.469 
about 12 hours at least in my test it
has<00:04:22.440> done<00:04:22.729> now<00:04:23.729> we'll<00:04:23.910> press<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.240> button

again to put it back into standby and
the<00:04:26.220> blue<00:04:26.400> light<00:04:26.610> comes<00:04:26.880> back<00:04:26.970> on<00:04:27.120> now<00:04:27.810> we'll

the blue light comes back on now we'll

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.420 
the blue light comes back on now we'll
try<00:04:28.530> out<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.740> motion<00:04:29.070> activation<00:04:29.610> mode

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
try out the motion activation mode

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.460 
try out the motion activation mode
now<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.880> takes<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.390> three-minute<00:04:31.930> clip<00:04:32.140> every

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
now this takes a three-minute clip every

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.290 
now this takes a three-minute clip every
time<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.860> sees<00:04:32.890> any<00:04:33.310> kind<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.640> motion<00:04:33.820> in<00:04:34.090> front

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
time it sees any kind of motion in front

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.090 
time it sees any kind of motion in front
of<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.540> camera<00:04:34.960> when<00:04:35.470> we<00:04:35.560> tap<00:04:35.830> this<00:04:36.040> button

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
of the camera when we tap this button

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.670 
of the camera when we tap this button
now<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:37.270> blue<00:04:37.480> light<00:04:37.690> will<00:04:37.720> flash<00:04:37.930> quickly

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
now the blue light will flash quickly

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.110 
now the blue light will flash quickly
what<00:04:38.860> that's<00:04:39.040> really<00:04:39.370> saying<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:39.790> get<00:04:39.970> out<00:04:40.090> of

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
what that's really saying is get out of

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.940 
what that's really saying is get out of
the<00:04:40.330> way<00:04:40.510> otherwise<00:04:41.260> you'll<00:04:41.470> end<00:04:41.530> up<00:04:41.680> on<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
the way otherwise you'll end up on the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.560 
the way otherwise you'll end up on the
video<00:04:42.250> because<00:04:42.640> when<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.880> blue<00:04:43.060> light<00:04:43.240> stops

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
video because when the blue light stops

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.630 
video because when the blue light stops
flashing<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:44.740> going<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.160> look<00:04:45.310> for<00:04:45.490> any

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
flashing it's going to look for any

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.450 
flashing it's going to look for any
motion<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.270> then<00:04:46.420> start<00:04:46.780> recording<00:04:47.110> again

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
motion and then start recording again

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.740 
motion and then start recording again
right<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.490> think<00:04:48.730> it's<00:04:48.880> time<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.330> have<00:04:49.540> a<00:04:49.570> look

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
right I think it's time to have a look

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.940 
right I think it's time to have a look
at<00:04:49.930> some<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.320> video<00:04:50.620> that's<00:04:50.830> been

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
at some of the video that's been

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.820 
at some of the video that's been
recorded<00:04:51.100> by<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.670> camera<00:04:52.440> hopefully<00:04:53.440> this

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
recorded by the camera hopefully this

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.740 
recorded by the camera hopefully this
will<00:04:53.980> give<00:04:54.160> you<00:04:54.280> some<00:04:54.520> idea<00:04:54.910> about<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.390> video

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
will give you some idea about the video

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.140 
will give you some idea about the video
and<00:04:56.050> sound<00:04:56.290> recording<00:04:56.950> quality<00:04:57.160> going<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:57.970> get

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
and sound recording quality going to get

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.670 
and sound recording quality going to get
from<00:04:58.330> this<00:04:58.450> camera

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
from this camera

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.450 
well my tell us a little bit of a
forwarded<00:05:02.289> it's<00:05:02.410> going<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.650> scratch<00:05:03.039> up<00:05:03.070> the

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
forwarded it's going to scratch up the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.279 
forwarded it's going to scratch up the
sensor<00:05:03.910> part<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.419> lounge<00:05:04.660> which<00:05:04.900> I'm<00:05:05.050> sure

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
sensor part the lounge which I'm sure

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.950 
sensor part the lounge which I'm sure
make<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.710> area<00:05:06.160> here<00:05:06.550> rather<00:05:07.090> brewery<00:05:07.660> I

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
make this area here rather brewery I

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.810 
make this area here rather brewery I
think<00:05:08.350> if<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.530> stunts<00:05:08.830> along<00:05:09.160> showing<00:05:09.639> like

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
think if I stunts along showing like

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.279 
think if I stunts along showing like
this<00:05:10.060> you'll<00:05:10.330> probably<00:05:10.539> find<00:05:10.780> that<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.050> get

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
this you'll probably find that I get

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.540 
this you'll probably find that I get
more<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.770> focus

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
more in focus

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.680 
more in focus
now<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.700> other<00:05:13.880> things<00:05:14.120> i<00:05:14.210> should<00:05:14.390> say<00:05:14.570> about

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
now the other things i should say about

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.920 
now the other things i should say about
the<00:05:14.900> camera<00:05:15.230> our<00:05:15.380> body<00:05:15.650> 20<00:05:15.980> 640<00:05:16.700> by<00:05:16.850> 480<00:05:17.480> is<00:05:17.690> not

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
the camera our body 20 640 by 480 is not

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.980 
the camera our body 20 640 by 480 is not
HD<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.430> means<00:05:19.700> that<00:05:20.030> things<00:05:20.270> aren't<00:05:20.660> as

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
HD and that means that things aren't as

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.530 
HD and that means that things aren't as
sharp<00:05:21.020> as<00:05:21.680> you'd<00:05:21.830> expect<00:05:21.950> on<00:05:22.460> an<00:05:22.580> HD<00:05:22.970> camera<00:05:23.270> of

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
sharp as you'd expect on an HD camera of

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.500 
sharp as you'd expect on an HD camera of
course<00:05:23.620> also<00:05:24.620> in<00:05:25.130> low<00:05:25.460> light<00:05:25.760> conditions

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510

this cameras a surveillance camera

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.740 
this cameras a surveillance camera
because<00:05:46.100> it's<00:05:46.250> not<00:05:46.430> suitable<00:05:46.940> for<00:05:47.000> every

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
quite good i thought i'd take the camera

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.940 
quite good i thought i'd take the camera
outside<00:06:11.540> even<00:06:12.140> though<00:06:12.230> this<00:06:12.410> isn't<00:06:12.620> really

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
outside even though this isn't really

outside even though this isn't really
what<00:06:13.100> it's<00:06:13.310> designed<00:06:13.430> for<00:06:13.790> just<00:06:14.240> to<00:06:14.330> show<00:06:14.540> what

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
what it's designed for just to show what

what it's designed for just to show what
it<00:06:14.930> looks<00:06:15.140> like<00:06:15.290> in<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.620> bit<00:06:15.800> better<00:06:16.160> light<00:06:16.640> now

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
it looks like in a bit better light now

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.240 
it looks like in a bit better light now
I<00:06:17.660> did<00:06:17.900> mention<00:06:17.930> of<00:06:18.320> course<00:06:18.530> this<00:06:18.710> scratch<00:06:19.070> in

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
I did mention of course this scratch in

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.530 
I did mention of course this scratch in
the<00:06:19.340> center<00:06:19.640> of<00:06:19.700> the<00:06:19.820> lens<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.180> you'll<00:06:20.360> bear

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
the center of the lens and you'll bear

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.450 
the center of the lens and you'll bear
to<00:06:20.660> see<00:06:20.930> it<00:06:21.080> as<00:06:21.230> I<00:06:21.410> pan<00:06:21.740> around<00:06:22.070> that<00:06:22.370> the

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
to see it as I pan around that the

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.610 
to see it as I pan around that the
middle<00:06:22.760> bit<00:06:22.910> gets<00:06:23.120> blurry<00:06:23.510> Zygo<00:06:23.990> past<00:06:24.320> things

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620

I don't know how that happened to be
honest<00:06:27.050> I<00:06:27.170> think<00:06:27.230> I'm<00:06:27.500> us<00:06:27.620> to<00:06:27.770> scuffed<00:06:28.130> it<00:06:28.250> on

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
honest I think I'm us to scuffed it on
