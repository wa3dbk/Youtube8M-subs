00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
that the fact that got me was they were

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.350 
that the fact that got me was they were
so<00:04:56.250> young<00:04:56.490> they<00:04:56.639> were<00:04:56.759> like<00:04:56.940> eighth<00:04:57.150> and

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
so young they were like eighth and
