00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.060
 catherine simon you are president of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.700
 innorobo so this world fair of the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 robotics here in lyon we are in 2015 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.579
 what do robots do and do 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 not at the moment 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.440
 so today the butler robot who 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.560
 realize all your desires and the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.940
 anticipate that does not make it on the other hand the 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.120
 robot is present in the industries 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.520
 and he's going to get into smes and pmi 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 because it becomes collaborative of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.090
 smaller size more flexible easy 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 to integrate into chains of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 production 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.320
 this is called the kobo ti he 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.219
 begins to be present much more 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.269
 in medical robotics and health with 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.039
 assistance to the nursing staff 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.019
 transports the drugs in 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.770
 institutions it helps the staff 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.170
 caregiver raised bed sick 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.870
 they warn them he's doing a surgery 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 minimally invasive with the help of the surgeon 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.970
 he begins to be present of course in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.799
 domestic robots that makes a stain and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 one but he did well and to your 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.930
 place it's the robot vacuum cleaner by 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.299
 example the robot mower what you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.189
 do not go here it's the coffee do your 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.299
 bed was storing your glasses 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.000
 sorting is your dirty laundry of your 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.710
 clean clothes he will know how to do it maybe 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780
 forward but for now the senses 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 humans 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.299
 did europe go well on 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.460
 this robotics market we feel that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.450
 Asians and Americans are 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.219
 rather at the forefront Europe 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.020
 do you trust 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.430
 our old continent so when I 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.380
 started the first edition of the new 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.450
 in 2011 I remember it 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.820
 look good the Asians have taken 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.409
 the advanced but the united states are not there 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.079
 again europe can be second 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.030
 and in fact, no, we let 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.189
 the united states are awake are 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.360
 woke up at full speed with the side 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.709
 east coast boston with hati m of course 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.390
 pittsburgh with carnegie mellon and the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.489
 west coast silicon valley robotic 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.959
 kloster the silicon valley the 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.440
 investors are well investing in the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.750
 equipment 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.190
 we still have our luck played with 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.910
 seven kobo tic I was talking about because 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.860
 that we have a great tissue of smes 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.380
 are sometimes extremely competitive 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.599
 globally and becoming international 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.000
 by this particular know-how 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.569
 extraordinary that we are therefore our 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.819
 creativity 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.010
 because we had said France 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.349
 has ideas here but it's true in 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.569
 do we have a lot of internet of things 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.910
 and internet business objects that 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.620
 are who went to the crs de las vegas 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.590
 while they are not coming here because 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.660
 we are 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.550
 the phase after the internet voice batik 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.319
 things as we say the internet of things 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.819
 robotics but who have a lot of 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.569
 creativity and who are a bit of 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.160
 world flagships 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.220
 so I think we have our role to play 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080
 in software engineering in research on 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.489
 is third world in terms of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680
 research and you just have to do the 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.799
 bridges to industry and then on 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.959
 some french micro florets 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.349
 medical robotics mechatronics the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.379
 drone 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.239
 we are very very strong what are 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.310
 according to you the stakes and the big ones 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.760
 challenges that come for the market the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.769
 robotics 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.010
 so there is a cultural challenge for 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.620
 Europe because the Japanese and the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 asians in general the ism 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.200
 robotics izem the robots the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.540
 consider as friends 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.069
 and so they rather want that their 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.079
 solve major societal problems 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.819
 the demographic problem 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.579
 the problem of assistance to the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.799
 elderly person in europe we have this 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.310
 cultural side of the machine that is going to 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.769
 rebel against us who will we 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.420
 make slave of the machine and so one 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.400
 already has a cultural challenge to do 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.079
 to understand to people that the robot is 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.269
 because we fantasize and we are afraid 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.450
 these are machines that are there for 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.190
 assist us with other major issues 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.690
 and still remain stakes for that 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.340
 this robotics become bigger 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.650
 public the problem of financing 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.359
 start up funding there are very very 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.459
 little seed money in europe 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.690
 you go to the silicon valley if 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.000
 you want easy money when 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.780
 you are in a start up on this challenge 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.570
 of being able to wait for one must 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.060
 we caught up in 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.010
 industrial automation then one 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.210
 can catch him because precisely he 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.010
 must seize the second wave is 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.120
 completely bios the first at least 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.620
 we do not have stocks that becomes 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.490
 obsolete to replace so that's 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.870
 rather a good news 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.889
 but you have to kiss him 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.830
 now collaborative robotics 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.360
 excavations ali a fear anyway 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.879
 we can have whom we hear about 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.340
 is that term robots and 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.949
 automation generally speaking the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.870
 society could destroy more 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.219
 jobs he creates on time 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.340
 what do you think about it? 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:52.919
 I think in the short and medium term so 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.930
 5 10 years it will create employment 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.520
 because isaac laugh job so 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.400
 which means that the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.349
 territories that will automate 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.930
 gain in productivity gains through 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.699
 robotics are going to be more competitive 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.879
 therefore gain market share or at 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.000
 minimum to keep them in the long term the 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:14.219
 30 40 years old I think we will live a 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.590
 profound transformation of our way 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:18.629
 to live at work so our 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.620
 home in our interactions in 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.460
 our mobility and that it is not a 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.169
 employment question 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.240
 it's that question is too basic 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.539
 it's a question of social model 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.520
 it's a question of two measures of 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.139
 our economy is what we need 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.689
 really measure our economy to the 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.669
 production with the gross national 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.169
 gross domestic product as eventually 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.020
 these are machines that will produce 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.029
 is we have to have the health of a 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.669
 country on an unemployment rate when 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.949
 finally I do not care because I 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.210
 could consume I would have plethora of 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.800
 goods that will be produced at cost 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.110
 a lot cheaper so I'll have 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.750
 finally access to this well be this 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.399
 comfort as I get these 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.779
 products that I produce so I think 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.680
 that we have to start rethinking our 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.770
 measures is known 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.020
 and then think contributors to the 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.710
 company what is the robot you 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.110
 dream then I have plenty of angel robots 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.240
 dream but what I'm dreaming about is 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.240
 that humans stop being afraid of 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.039
 robots that humans call themselves and themselves 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.600
 ask the question really arises the 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.460
 question by being informed of what these 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.250
 technologies can do that can 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.330
 take away the handicap of my handicap 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.979
 disappear from our vocabulary the word 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.610
 road accident can disappear from 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.380
 our vocabulary 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.259
 it's true that humans are 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.020
 benevolent and that we go to a 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.880
 deep reflection on what ethics 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.400
 what value for its technologies 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.960
 robotic and how can we 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.940
 use for a better world a little 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.560
 utopian 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.789
 catherine simon what's the matter 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.949
 I have not asked you, and which 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.060
 you would have liked to answer then 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.680
 I would like you to ask me 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.590
 question of May that there is behind 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.479
 innorobo because it's always good 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.070
 me who answer because I am the 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.740
 president of the company but last 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.330
 there is a formidable team 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.270
 people who support us then y'a 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.510
 beryl who is my general manager and 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.039
 who calls the exposons the people of the 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.409
 robotics that moves all the time 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.979
 she has three young children her husband 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.560
 ugly 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.090
 she is wonderful ya jade our 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.639
 social networking specialist and then 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.289
 our expert is the roboticists n to 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.849
 worry and in robotics 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.020
 she has beautifully spoken well 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:26.159
 to researchers that sometimes I 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.710
 do not always understand what they say 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:31.440
 and she she understands everything and she is 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.630
 fabulous and bubbly energy ago 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.729
 benoît who support us poor 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.889
 Benoît is the only guy in our 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.690
 team and it's our logisticians it's 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.830
 he who climbs the living room and they sting themselves
