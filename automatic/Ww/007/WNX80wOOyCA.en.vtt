00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.250 
have some sticky pistons you can make
this<00:00:15.189> alright<00:00:16.189> so<00:00:16.460> here's<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.449> trap<00:00:17.960> what<00:00:18.199> it

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
this alright so here's the trap what it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.689 
this alright so here's the trap what it
looks<00:00:18.410> like<00:00:18.529> just<00:00:18.740> a<00:00:18.830> second<00:00:19.130> normal<00:00:19.369> hallway

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
looks like just a second normal hallway

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.509 
looks like just a second normal hallway
you<00:00:20.359> step<00:00:20.600> out<00:00:20.750> on<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:20.869> Pistons<00:00:21.350> it<00:00:22.039> opens<00:00:22.369> the

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
you step out on the Pistons it opens the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.779 
you step out on the Pistons it opens the
trap<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.060> you<00:00:23.170> can't<00:00:24.170> go<00:00:24.320> back<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.609> only

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
way to cross is if you place a brick and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.840 

alright<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:20.880> say<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:22.670> dig<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
alright and then say your dig a little

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.260 
alright and then say your dig a little
trench<00:01:24.350> right<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.160> deep<00:01:27.710> place

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
trench right here just one deep place

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.540 
trench right here just one deep place
blocks<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.510> this<00:01:30.690> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.900> where<00:01:31.140> your

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
blocks like this this is where your

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.090 
blocks like this this is where your
pressure<00:01:32.550> plates<00:01:32.910> are<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.770> blow

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pressure plates are going to go and blow

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.570 
pressure plates are going to go and blow
the<00:01:35.250> pressure<00:01:35.490> plates<00:01:36.560> we're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> place

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.960 

redstone<00:01:42.650> dust<00:01:43.650> so<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.370> when<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.550> step<00:01:44.820> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
redstone dust so that when you step on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.530 
redstone dust so that when you step on
it<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.270> activates<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> behind<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.480> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it it activates it and behind all of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.040 
it it activates it and behind all of
these<00:01:48.900> Pistons<00:01:50.450> place<00:01:53.360> redstone<00:01:54.360> repeaters

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
these Pistons place redstone repeaters

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.200 
these Pistons place redstone repeaters
you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.100> set<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.370> on<00:01:56.430> whatever<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.820> want

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you can set them on whatever you want

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
you can set them on whatever you want
the<00:01:58.200> longer<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:58.800> them<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.010> more

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the longer you set them on the more

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.560 
the longer you set them on the more
likely<00:01:59.610> does<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.880> person<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.240> make<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> all

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
likely does the person will make it all

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.100 
likely does the person will make it all
the<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.720> across<00:02:00.840> before<00:02:01.229> falling<00:02:02.930> unless<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the way across before falling unless you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.859 
the way across before falling unless you
make<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:05.180> hundred<00:02:06.180> log<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.810> of

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
make this like a hundred log out of

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.250 
make this like a hundred log out of
those<00:02:10.220> all<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.850> now<00:02:12.140> don't<00:02:13.140> you're

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
those all right so now don't you're

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920 
those all right so now don't you're
going<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:14.670> dig<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> trench<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.750> little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
going to do is dig the trench a little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.370 
going to do is dig the trench a little
bit<00:02:16.020> longer<00:02:16.170> about<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:18.840> takes<00:02:19.230> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
bit longer about there and then takes a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.190 
bit longer about there and then takes a
block<00:02:19.650> here<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.610> then<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> redstone<00:02:21.930> torch

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
block here and then the redstone torch

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.970 
block here and then the redstone torch
here<00:02:22.730> then<00:02:23.730> place<00:02:24.090> redstone<00:02:24.360> dust<00:02:24.980> connecting

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
here then place redstone dust connecting

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.620 
here then place redstone dust connecting
through<00:02:26.160> all<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.640> repeaters<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.269> repeat

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
through all of the repeaters and repeat

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.699 
through all of the repeaters and repeat
this<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:27.989> other<00:02:28.080> side<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.410> well

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.559 

what<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.950> does<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.580> activates<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
what this does is it activates the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.630 
what this does is it activates the
Pistons<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.910> they<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.209> on<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> time

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
Pistons so that they are on all the time

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.210 
Pistons so that they are on all the time
so<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.989> there's<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.140> seemingly<00:02:43.530> natural<00:02:44.459> for

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
so that there's a seemingly natural for

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
sticky pistons and again at the same

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.809 
sticky pistons and again at the same
point<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.950> did<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> other<00:03:23.220> Pistons<00:03:23.730> you

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
point that you did the other Pistons you

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.059 
point that you did the other Pistons you
won't<00:03:23.970> put<00:03:24.090> these<00:03:24.269> pistons<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.709> just<00:03:25.739> looks

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
won't put these pistons so it just looks

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.820 
won't put these pistons so it just looks
like<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.250> normal<00:03:26.340> wall<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> no<00:03:28.440> one's<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.799> to

this<00:03:35.340> build<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:37.340> little<00:03:38.340> step

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
this build here like this little step

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.849 
this build here like this little step
system<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.170> from<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.739> we

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
system and then back from this one we

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.650 
system and then back from this one we
can<00:03:40.980> build<00:03:41.359> just<00:03:42.359> three<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.450> side

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
can build just three so so on the side

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.009 
can build just three so so on the side
of<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:45.900> block<00:03:46.970> place<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.000> toward<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.600> redstone

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
of this block place it toward a redstone

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.280
