00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
this issue probably this is not the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.899 
this issue probably this is not the
product<00:03:11.699> for<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.810> may<00:03:13.169> want<00:03:13.469> to<00:03:13.909> consider

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
product for you you may want to consider

the<00:03:15.449> first<00:03:15.840> vision<00:03:16.349> clip<00:03:16.680> I'm<00:03:16.919> not<00:03:17.790> sure

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the first vision clip I'm not sure

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.330 
the first vision clip I'm not sure
because<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:19.169> have<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.560> original<00:03:20.189> one

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
because I I don't have the original one

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.759 
because I I don't have the original one
but<00:03:20.370> i'm<00:03:20.819> pretty<00:03:21.060> sure<00:03:21.419> that<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.590> original

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
but i'm pretty sure that the original

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.170 
but i'm pretty sure that the original
one<00:03:23.189> doesn't<00:03:23.699> have<00:03:23.729> rubbers<00:03:24.560> rubber<00:03:25.560> corners

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
one doesn't have rubbers rubber corners

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.530 
one doesn't have rubbers rubber corners
so<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.659> will<00:03:27.930> maybe<00:03:28.549> scratch<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.970> capsule

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
so it will maybe scratch the capsule

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.659 
so it will maybe scratch the capsule
rebel<00:03:30.629> just<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.259> little<00:03:31.680> bit<00:03:31.829> but<00:03:32.430> i'm<00:03:32.639> sure

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
rebel just a little bit but i'm sure

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.449 
rebel just a little bit but i'm sure
that<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.479> can<00:03:33.930> barely<00:03:34.290> see<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.889> I've<00:03:35.069> seen

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
that you can barely see it I've seen

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.800 
that you can barely see it I've seen
applegarth<00:03:36.269> video<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.819> she<00:03:38.819> was<00:03:39.180> using<00:03:39.479> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
applegarth video and she was using the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.800 
applegarth video and she was using the
original<00:03:39.930> vision<00:03:40.500> clip<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.389> it<00:03:42.389> hasn't

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
original vision clip and it hasn't

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.330 
original vision clip and it hasn't
damaged<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.229> plastic<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.859> capsule<00:03:44.250> rebel

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
damaged the plastic of the capsule rebel

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.770 
damaged the plastic of the capsule rebel
so<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.629> may<00:03:45.930> be<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.169> better<00:03:46.560> option<00:03:46.769> or<00:03:47.669> I<00:03:48.269> mean

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
so this may be a better option or I mean

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.530 
so this may be a better option or I mean
I've<00:03:49.019> used<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.739> product<00:03:50.159> exactly<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.269> it
