00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.290
 for a character 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.630
 for the script 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.790
 a sacrifice 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.969

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.580
 I started to do the ponies dijieron 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.110
 very long sentences so we started not 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.250

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.250

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.110
 let's start with the basics your element of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.030
 harmony represents loyalty for 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.649
 what her friends will never leave her 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.600
 mane contains all the colors of the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.200
 rainbow and well this bears his name 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.649
 the rainbow rainbow faster for me 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649
 has many 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.030
 and no one 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.189
 too soon it will be released 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.329
 a film focused more on it and only 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.329
 like a blow to the head 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.700
 literally this dear pony has 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.330
 so much speed that it can break the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.330
 sound barrier 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.660

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.670

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670
 same speed 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.690
 sure it also appeared in others 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.690
 programs like mad tv 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.960
 I do not think we 're represented like that 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.250
