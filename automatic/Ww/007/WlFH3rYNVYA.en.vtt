00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
wait you'll understand so you're going

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
wait you'll understand so you're going
to<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> measurement<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.239> feet<00:00:48.539> three

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to get a measurement like two feet three

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
to get a measurement like two feet three
inches<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.890> gonna<00:00:50.100> say<00:00:50.340> multiply<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.940> by

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
inches and it's gonna say multiply it by

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.410 
inches and it's gonna say multiply it by
five<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:52.739> multiply<00:00:53.309> two<00:00:53.370> times<00:00:53.850> five<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
five you multiply two times five and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.580 
five you multiply two times five and
three<00:00:54.750> times<00:00:55.020> five

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
three times five

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060 
three times five
that<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.579> simple<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.590> there<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.800> not

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that is how simple this is there is not

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
that is how simple this is there is not
a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.940> thinking<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.840> occur<00:01:01.199> except

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
a lot of thinking to occur except

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
a lot of thinking to occur except
knowing<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.129> multiplication<00:01:02.550> tables<00:01:03.379> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
knowing your multiplication tables you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.359 
knowing your multiplication tables you
shouldn't<00:01:04.979> need<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> calculator<00:01:05.840> for<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.609 

after<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.760> multiplied<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.350> then

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
after you have multiplied you then

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.390 
after you have multiplied you then
simplify<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.900> fifteen<00:01:19.619> inches<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
simplify so you have fifteen inches you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
simplify so you have fifteen inches you
really<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.939> what<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:25.020> send<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> out

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
really have what if I can send you out

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:35.410 
really have what if I can send you out
fifteen<00:01:25.890> inches<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:27.030> have

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.640 

so<00:01:36.420> there's<00:01:36.630> ten<00:01:36.900> inches<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> foot<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so there's ten inches in a foot so if I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.700 
so there's ten inches in a foot so if I
add<00:01:40.770> 15<00:01:41.400> inches<00:01:42.649> one<00:01:43.649> foot<00:01:43.920> three<00:01:44.369> inches<00:01:45.710> all

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
add 15 inches one foot three inches all

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.929 
add 15 inches one foot three inches all
right<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.790> first<00:01:48.060> example<00:01:49.939> five

right so here is your first example five

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.340 
right so here is your first example five
times<00:01:51.659> three<00:01:52.290> feet<00:01:52.590> two<00:01:52.920> inches<00:01:53.930> how<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> do

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
times three feet two inches how you do

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.910 
times three feet two inches how you do
the<00:01:55.500> problem<00:01:55.700> five<00:01:56.700> times<00:01:57.000> three<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.920> right

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the problem five times three and right

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.200 
the problem five times three and right
feet<00:01:59.280> behind<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.560> five<00:02:01.560> times<00:02:01.860> two<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.460> right

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
feet behind it five times two and right

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.399 
feet behind it five times two and right
inches<00:02:03.659> behind<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> five<00:02:07.079> times

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
inches behind it so what is five times

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.240 
inches behind it so what is five times
three<00:02:08.569> thank<00:02:09.569> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
three thank you

three thank you
what<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.400> two<00:02:11.670> times<00:02:12.000> five

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
what is two times five

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.580 
what is two times five
so<00:02:14.910> at<00:02:15.120> 5:15<00:02:16.110> feet<00:02:16.350> 10<00:02:16.620> inches<00:02:17.540> which

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
so at 5:15 feet 10 inches which

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.470 
so at 5:15 feet 10 inches which
simplified<00:02:19.590> down<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.370> 5<00:02:20.790> yards<00:02:21.540> 10<00:02:21.930> inches

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
simplified down is 5 yards 10 inches

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.020 
simplified down is 5 yards 10 inches
because<00:02:24.480> there<00:02:24.660> are<00:02:24.750> 3<00:02:25.110> feet<00:02:25.680> per<00:02:26.250> yard<00:02:26.490> 3

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
because there are 3 feet per yard 3

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.000 
because there are 3 feet per yard 3
divided<00:02:32.420> 50/50<00:02:33.420> feet<00:02:33.870> 10<00:02:34.110> inches<00:02:34.140> my<00:02:34.650> answer

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
divided 50/50 feet 10 inches my answer

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.430 
divided 50/50 feet 10 inches my answer
is<00:02:35.130> 5<00:02:35.400> yards<00:02:35.910> 10<00:02:36.180> inches<00:02:36.630> does<00:02:37.140> everyone

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
is 5 yards 10 inches does everyone

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.110 
is 5 yards 10 inches does everyone
understand<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:37.860> that's<00:02:38.430> how<00:02:38.640> simple<00:02:38.700> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
understand that that's how simple that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.930 
understand that that's how simple that
is<00:02:39.230> take<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> number<00:02:40.500> multiply<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.280> by<00:02:41.520> both

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
is take the number multiply it by both

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:53.380 
is take the number multiply it by both
measurements<00:02:42.800> simplify<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:51.180> we'll<00:02:51.600> look<00:02:51.810> at

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
measurements simplify now we'll look at

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.230 
measurements simplify now we'll look at
dividing<00:02:56.540> same<00:02:57.540> thing<00:02:58.820> opposite<00:02:59.820> thing

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
dividing same thing opposite thing

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.950 
dividing same thing opposite thing
opposite<00:03:01.110> direction<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.270> instead<00:03:03.630> of

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
opposite direction so now instead of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.470 
opposite direction so now instead of
multiplying<00:03:04.590> or<00:03:04.830> dividing<00:03:04.860> again<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:06.060> divide

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
multiplying or dividing again we divide

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.430 
multiplying or dividing again we divide
each<00:03:07.190> measurement<00:03:08.190> by<00:03:08.520> 5<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.180> 15<00:03:09.870> yards

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
each measurement by 5 so 15 yards

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.750 
each measurement by 5 so 15 yards
divided<00:03:10.920> by<00:03:11.040> 5<00:03:11.340> what<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:11.880> 15<00:03:12.420> divided<00:03:12.660> by<00:03:12.780> 5

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
divided by 5 what is 15 divided by 5

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.650 
divided by 5 what is 15 divided by 5
Kelcey<00:03:14.840> 3<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.200> I'd<00:03:16.320> write<00:03:16.500> 3<00:03:16.800> yards<00:03:17.130> 10<00:03:17.910> divided

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
Kelcey 3 so I'd write 3 yards 10 divided

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.340 
Kelcey 3 so I'd write 3 yards 10 divided
by<00:03:18.690> 5<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.200> what<00:03:19.380> Kayla<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.600> then<00:03:21.780> I'd<00:03:21.900> write<00:03:22.110> 2

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
by 5 is what Kayla so then I'd write 2

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.770 
by 5 is what Kayla so then I'd write 2
feet<00:03:23.960> so<00:03:24.960> 15<00:03:25.350> divided<00:03:25.620> by<00:03:25.710> 5<00:03:26.100> 10<00:03:26.910> divided<00:03:27.360> by<00:03:27.390> 5

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
feet so 15 divided by 5 10 divided by 5

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.760 
feet so 15 divided by 5 10 divided by 5
and<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:29.340> get<00:03:29.400> 3<00:03:30.060> yards<00:03:30.360> 2<00:03:30.630> feet<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.320> simplify

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
and I get 3 yards 2 feet can I simplify

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.790 
and I get 3 yards 2 feet can I simplify
it<00:03:32.300> nope<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.750> as<00:03:33.960> simple<00:03:34.140> as<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:34.650> gonna

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
it nope it is as simple as it's gonna

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.490 
it nope it is as simple as it's gonna
get<00:03:35.390> that's<00:03:36.390> my<00:03:36.600> answer<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:40.340> page<00:03:41.340> 209

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
get that's my answer that is page 209

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.290 
get that's my answer that is page 209
which<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.740> part<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.130> yesterday's<00:03:44.700> assignment

which was part of yesterday's assignment
that's<00:03:46.170> all<00:03:46.410> you're<00:03:46.590> doing<00:03:46.890> with<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:48.260> how<00:03:49.260> many

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
that's all you're doing with it how many

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.760 
that's all you're doing with it how many
of<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.010> can<00:03:50.190> handle<00:03:50.400> that
