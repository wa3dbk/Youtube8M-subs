see<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.650> let's<00:01:31.920> say<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.490> here's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
see that let's say there we go here's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.319 
see that let's say there we go here's
the<00:01:33.240> charging<00:01:33.780> port<00:01:34.130> USB<00:01:35.130> out<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.210> can

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the charging port USB out so we can

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.240 
the charging port USB out so we can
charge<00:01:36.600> other<00:01:36.990> devices<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.100> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
charge other devices right from this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
charge other devices right from this
device<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> switch<00:01:39.960> right<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
device it's going to switch right here

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.069 
device it's going to switch right here
so<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> locator<00:01:41.850> built-in<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.810> clap

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
