00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello how are you today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:09.189
 pass well this is a glitter 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.189
 loose for this 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.580
 with this they can do anything 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.940
 what is the particularity of the lists 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.970
 so they do not fall when you take 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.950
 military with the brush and is in this 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.770
 been the clicker starts to finish by 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.750
 the face and it's super difficult to get it out 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.300
 change well 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.150
 they stay where you propose so 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.430
 stay keep looking that now you 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.400
 taught how to do it to start what 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.400
 we are going to need is fine alcohol 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.500
 Glycerin Glycerin is a substance 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.190
 which maintains the humidity is used in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.340
 creams are used 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.710
 in makeup is used justly 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.570
 for a humectant is an agent 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.789
 moisturizer and this is achieved in 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.760
 any girls pharmacy are we going to 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.070
 need a syringe 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.440
 a container to put and mix the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.440
 things something to mix 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.650
 kitchen roll or if we get stained and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 obviously an empty palette 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.020
 but of course 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.950
 and we are going to use this 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.820
 We started by placing three parts of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.770
 alcohol for one of glycerin 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.020
 in this case place 2 caps of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.590
 alcohol and a little more than half of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590
 glycerin 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.550
 Glycerin has a consistency 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 pretty viscous so we have to 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.100
 mix it well trying to unify the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.229
 two means 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.820
 then we put the liter in the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.150
 metallic container in which he will go 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.150
 definitely 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.100
 [Music] 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.590
 Ideally, do not fill the container 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.180
 glitter but leave a place for the mix 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.170
 and a half although in this case it would be the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.170
 alcohol with glycerin 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.930
 we take the syringe and with that we take the 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.269
 liquid this liquid we are going to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.469
 distribute in the container making 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.469
 mojito will weaken 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 Y 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.819
 yes 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.470
 once we finished lowering the military 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.840
 with our mixture we are going to take a 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.730
 spatula and let's stir the glitter 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.260
 so that each particle gets wet with 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.379
 this mixture 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.379
 i 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.780
 Y 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.670
 if we see that it is very liquid or that we 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.640
 over the place we add again 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.040
 glitter and if in this case as here we 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.770
 it is very pasty we add again 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:04.470
 add the mix and so on 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:07.470
 [Music] 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.470
 i 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.170
 [Music] 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.360
 once we achieve the consistency 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.100
 desired and the container is full as 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.020
 we want we must leave 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.050
 rest this mixture pretty much a 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.050
 hour 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.470
 if the proportions of the mix in medium 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.630
 they are poorly made and by those coincidences 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.150
 we put a little more alcohol than 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.560
 glycerin is going to happen that is going to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.239
 enable enable will stay 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.670
 too hard 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.510
 if this happened to us, we do the same 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.230
 we break the iter well and repeat 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.230
 the previous steps 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.819
 no no 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.819
 all this is right now 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.830
 once an hour passed and we see that the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.370
 clicker is wet pretty wet but 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.070
 that is not like at the beginning we are going to 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.200
 take a 25 cent coin as you see 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.270
 fit fair 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.690
 a piece of cloth any fabric that 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.389
 have to have a pattern and we're going to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.549
 press the fabric up to the 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.940
 25 cents coin and we press 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.940
 until all the liquid comes out 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.220
 once they finished pushing him and 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.400
 they have to let him rest for 24 hours 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.990
 reaction to the next day they will be able to use 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 and so they have the glitter ready to put 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.710
 in a palette I hope you have them 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.600
 served the council do not stop 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.500
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.500
