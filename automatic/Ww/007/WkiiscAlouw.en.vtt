00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.030 
you have two little divots which are
basically<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.140> pull<00:02:48.410> these<00:02:48.560> out<00:02:48.799> and

basically so you pull these out and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.770 
basically so you pull these out and
depending<00:02:49.459> on<00:02:49.549> what<00:02:49.760> side<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.180> want<00:02:50.360> your<00:02:50.540> fan

depending on what side you want your fan

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.360 
depending on what side you want your fan
you<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.140> your<00:02:51.379> fan<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.920> could<00:02:52.190> plug

you have your fan that you could plug

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.970 
you have your fan that you could plug
into<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:53.769> so<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.750> very<00:02:56.959> functionable<00:02:57.739> it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
into that so it's very functionable it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.119 
into that so it's very functionable it
is<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> little<00:02:58.579> bit<00:02:58.790> larger<00:02:59.239> as<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.540> said<00:03:00.099> than<00:03:01.099> a
