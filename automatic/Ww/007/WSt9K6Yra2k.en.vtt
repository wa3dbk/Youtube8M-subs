say this is a the smallest waterproof
digital<00:01:24.270> camera<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.259> I've

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
digital camera that's out there I've

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.530 
digital camera that's out there I've
seen<00:01:26.040> Olympus<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:26.880> small<00:01:27.150> too<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
seen Olympus are pretty small too but I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
seen Olympus are pretty small too but I
think<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.080> smaller<00:01:28.380> than<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.280> I've

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
think this is smaller than that and I've

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.740 
think this is smaller than that and I've
had<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> chance<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> play<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.509> at

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
the the main test will be is when I

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.150 
the the main test will be is when I
actually<00:04:37.510> take<00:04:37.780> pictures<00:04:37.960> record<00:04:38.380> put<00:04:39.040> this

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
actually take pictures record put this

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.190 
actually take pictures record put this
underneath<00:04:39.460> water<00:04:39.880> hopefully<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.900> will<00:04:40.960> stay
