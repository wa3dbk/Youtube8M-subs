there<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.430> one<00:01:28.610> place<00:01:28.910> it's<00:01:29.720> also<00:01:29.900> an

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
there in one place it's also an

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.050 
there in one place it's also an
interesting<00:01:30.680> place<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.920> work<00:01:31.280> because<00:01:31.490> while

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
interesting place to work because while

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.270 
interesting place to work because while
I'm<00:01:32.270> doing<00:01:32.450> research<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:33.230> basic<00:01:33.710> sciences<00:01:34.130> in

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
I'm doing research in basic sciences in

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.370 
I'm doing research in basic sciences in
amman<00:01:34.550> ology<00:01:34.910> it's<00:01:35.210> connected<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.200> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
amman ology it's connected to the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620 
amman ology it's connected to the
hospital<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.250> anytime<00:01:37.700> we<00:01:37.730> need<00:01:38.120> patient

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
hospital so anytime we need patient

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.780 
hospital so anytime we need patient
samples<00:01:39.110> or<00:01:39.440> we<00:01:39.740> need<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.950> do<00:01:40.070> trials<00:01:40.550> on

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
samples or we need to do trials on

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.110 
samples or we need to do trials on
patients<00:01:42.010> there's<00:01:43.010> a<00:01:43.070> direct<00:01:43.400> link<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
patients there's a direct link to the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.780 
patients there's a direct link to the
hospital<00:01:44.660> so<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.350> makes<00:01:45.590> our<00:01:45.800> work<00:01:46.040> much

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
hospital so this makes our work much

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.720 
hospital so this makes our work much
easier<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.540> faster<00:01:48.230> it's<00:01:48.800> been<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.340> great

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
easier and faster it's been a great

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.460 
easier and faster it's been a great
experience<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.690> don't<00:01:50.930> think<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.320> could

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
experience I don't think that I could

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.350 
experience I don't think that I could
have<00:01:51.710> had<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.100> same<00:01:52.280> experience<00:01:52.820> anywhere

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
have had the same experience anywhere

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.840 
have had the same experience anywhere
else<00:01:53.630> because<00:01:54.470> while<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.280> challenging

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
else because while this is a challenging

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.580 
else because while this is a challenging
environment<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.630> do<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.110> work<00:01:57.260> hard

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
environment and you do have to work hard

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.940 
environment and you do have to work hard
it's<00:01:57.800> also<00:01:57.980> very<00:01:58.400> supportive<00:01:59.090> environment
