00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
that in the first episode I did

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.179 
that in the first episode I did
basically<00:01:58.929> when<00:01:59.049> you<00:01:59.140> bring<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.770> land<00:01:59.950> it

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
basically when you bring in to land it

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.609 
basically when you bring in to land it
you<00:02:00.369> have<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.640> have<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.819> friend<00:02:01.299> that<00:02:01.569> comes<00:02:02.469> out

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
you have to have a friend that comes out

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.419 
you have to have a friend that comes out
to<00:02:02.770> catch<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.189> so<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:05.350> don't<00:02:05.500> do<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.799> that

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
to catch it so we don't do that that

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.919 
to catch it so we don't do that that
would<00:02:06.579> be<00:02:06.640> unsafe<00:02:08.519> this<00:02:09.519> is<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.330> rig<00:02:10.599> it's

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
would be unsafe this is the rig it's

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.830 
would be unsafe this is the rig it's
super<00:02:11.799> complicated<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.150> cylinder<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.540> cut

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
super complicated it's a cylinder I cut

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.550 
super complicated it's a cylinder I cut
