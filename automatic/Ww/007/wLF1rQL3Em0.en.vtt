the last example so you look around get

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.270 
the last example so you look around get
one<00:03:51.620> they're<00:03:51.860> placed<00:03:53.650> because<00:03:54.650> your<00:03:55.070> orange

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.300 

read<00:04:00.240> well<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.140> place<00:04:01.710> it<00:04:01.890> at<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.040> end

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
read well you can place it at the end

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.230 
read well you can place it at the end
and<00:04:03.170> blue<00:04:04.170> goes<00:04:04.470> there<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:06.090> what<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.900> do<00:04:07.080> is

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
and blue goes there so what you do is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.360 
and blue goes there so what you do is
you<00:04:09.240> go<00:04:09.450> look<00:04:09.900> for<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.290> one<00:04:10.410> that's<00:04:10.590> easy<00:04:10.830> this

you go look for the one that's easy this

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.070 
you go look for the one that's easy this
one<00:04:11.960> you<00:04:12.960> bring<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.410> up<00:04:14.540> then<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.750> see<00:04:15.930> your

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
one you bring it up then you see your

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.390 
one you bring it up then you see your
orange<00:04:16.550> bring<00:04:17.550> it<00:04:17.670> up<00:04:20.420> then<00:04:21.420> you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.690> your

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
orange bring it up then you have your

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.040 
orange bring it up then you have your
blue<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:26.490> move<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.570> doesn't<00:04:27.960> bother

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
blue you move that so it doesn't bother

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.570 
blue you move that so it doesn't bother
anything<00:04:28.590> put<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.460> there<00:04:29.670> move<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.630> back<00:04:31.580> put

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
anything put it there move it back put

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.370 
anything put it there move it back put
it<00:04:32.610> up<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:34.850> then<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.060> get<00:04:36.210> your<00:04:38.240> red<00:04:39.240> here<00:04:39.540> you

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
it up and then you get your red here you

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.330 
it up and then you get your red here you
just<00:04:40.830> push<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:41.700> sideways<00:04:42.210> move<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.080> top<00:04:43.340> where

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
just push it sideways move the top where

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.410 
just push it sideways move the top where
it<00:04:44.370> goes<00:04:44.580> put<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.510> back

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.680 

ok<00:04:52.420> it<00:04:52.570> was<00:04:52.720> not<00:04:52.930> quite<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.380> last<00:04:53.560> one<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.980> had

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
ok it was not quite the last one I had

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.110 
ok it was not quite the last one I had
something<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.840> say<00:04:56.020> before<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.500> end<00:04:56.880> so<00:04:57.880> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
something to say before the end so the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.900 
something to say before the end so the
trick<00:04:58.390> is<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.630> play<00:04:59.080> around<00:04:59.320> with<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.680> top<00:04:59.950> you

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
trick is to play around with the top you

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.410 
trick is to play around with the top you
just<00:05:01.150> got<00:05:01.390> to<00:05:01.420> remember<00:05:01.630> that<00:05:02.200> green<00:05:02.560> is

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
just got to remember that green is

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.570 
just got to remember that green is
opposite<00:05:04.420> to<00:05:04.450> blue<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.110> red<00:05:05.950> is<00:05:06.010> up<00:05:06.280> as<00:05:06.460> at

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
opposite to blue and red is up as at

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.090 
opposite to blue and red is up as at
Orange<00:05:07.030> so<00:05:07.810> when<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.260> can<00:05:08.380> remember<00:05:08.890> that

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
Orange so when you can remember that

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.820 
Orange so when you can remember that
it's<00:05:09.460> going<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.700> be<00:05:09.820> easy<00:05:10.140> so<00:05:11.140> let's<00:05:11.380> say<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.560> do

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
it's going to be easy so let's say we do

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.380 
it's going to be easy so let's say we do
it<00:05:12.960> just<00:05:13.960> with<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.710> top<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.520> know<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.210> red

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
it just with the top so you know the red

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.750 
it just with the top so you know the red
is<00:05:16.570> opposite<00:05:17.020> or<00:05:17.170> unsure<00:05:17.620> you<00:05:17.800> place<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.280> well

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
is opposite or unsure you place it well

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.490 
is opposite or unsure you place it well
you<00:05:19.240> don't<00:05:19.360> place<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.630> there<00:05:19.930> because<00:05:20.140> it's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
you don't place it there because it's

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.210 
you don't place it there because it's
not<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.830> yellow<00:05:21.040> part<00:05:21.310> ok<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:24.040> yellow

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
not the yellow part ok so the yellow

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.950 
not the yellow part ok so the yellow
goes<00:05:24.520> there<00:05:24.880> it's<00:05:25.060> already<00:05:25.420> in<00:05:25.510> front<00:05:25.660> of<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
goes there it's already in front of the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.210 
goes there it's already in front of the
red<00:05:26.170> and<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:27.210> orange<00:05:28.290> is<00:05:29.290> contrary<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.950> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
red and the orange is contrary to the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.110 
red and the orange is contrary to the
red<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.240> turn<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.140> top<00:05:32.350> twice<00:05:32.970> put<00:05:33.970> the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
red so you turn the top twice put the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.350 
red so you turn the top twice put the
orange<00:05:34.240> there<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:35.320> bring<00:05:35.590> it<00:05:35.710> back<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:37.150> your
