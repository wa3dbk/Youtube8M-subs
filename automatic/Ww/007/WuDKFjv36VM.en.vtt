00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.330
 do you have the treatise of speech and language writing after ticking 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.510
 differently 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.780
 so here is the general diagram of chenvu will talk I go first 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.359
 talked about the calling vocation of the speech 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.090
 in parallel with the overtaking vocation 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.730
 of writing 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.949
 then fractal structures in the rescue 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 fractal structure in writing 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.859
 then of the prediction one rattles and the stop of written production 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.980
 I will remind them of the notions of symbols and archetypes their 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.770
 projections in speech and writing 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.660
 I would say a few words about the power of the enigma which is driving the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 communication 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.830
 I would summarily compare western thought and Chinese thought 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.720
 irritated the rituals in speech and in writing and some tips 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 to finish 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.740
 then I will call back 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.490
 before getting to the heart of the subject 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.510
 that it is only belatedly that thought transforms transform these 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 vehicles then in words 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.510
 he is aware of it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 she does not work it marks 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.480
 the preco if he is the mayor jean-louis olive 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.930
 expresses his images 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.610
 and it is only later 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.300
 jospin this late it sometimes expresses a tenth of a second goes up to 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.400
 the advanced by infinitely faster 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.260
 that language 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.290
 it is only belatedly that perception and on nbc 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.820
 in formulation 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 claimed logical cleaver 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
 Thursday claimed because in the convention 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.360
 ap a completely different logic and a different reality than the one that appears 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.460
 at the concert level 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.320
 the manga played in the waking state barely reproducing wealth 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.520
 these emergences of the imaginary 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.820
 because this emergence leaves way radically other than that of the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.150
 speech 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.680
 sarah palin also that everything that does not have a job does not exist 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 in other words 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.230
 as soon as we conceptualize to something we give it to another this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.139
 name it can be a periphrasis 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.699
 it can be a new world where it can be the adaptation of an old 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.579
 and whenever there was a name in our language 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.949
 it means that the concept exists 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.529
 that we recognized him 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.949
 that the object is an existing object 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.509
 there are words that are missing in a language we notice when we do 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.809
 a translation 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.979
 that means that this concept of amethyst not in the language it wants 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.999
 to say that there is an impoverishment compared to the other world 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.499
 for the q2 the group air 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.079
 because sometimes the words and twitched effect lost because he no longer 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.909
 been used 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.999
 so I would say that basically 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.440
 he writes this point 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.499
 the spoken language 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.029
 I will wait for the speech 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.680
 and that the vocation of the spoken language is a calling vocation, that is to say 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.379
 to call the pension on something 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.029
 while the vocation 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.889
 written language 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.889
 it is absolutely early 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.589
 the vocation of the written word is to go beyond thought so as to 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.659
 blame 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.129
 p for the others something 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.919
 who will have a life of his own 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.669
 while speeches 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.619
 If you want 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.239
 those for the also knows with some 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.259
 his value 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.309
 so flavors and know have the same root 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.990
 in other words in the speech that's why 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.239
 we just listen to conferences like the dagger 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.930
 it's because we find a different flavor than we feel 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.399
 a different feeling 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.900
 than the one we called bow 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.900
 while reading 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.109
 so a discourse knows more truly a mantra that is to say 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.509
 during the speech 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.279
 you will recognize 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.549
 especially if you retrieve speech call after you have recorded 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.369
 that some words come back with the same intonations pronounced by the 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:07.219
 same speaker 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.559
 in other words, this effect of repetition is the effect of the lack of racy fires 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:12.290
 to hand over the person 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.290
 always in the same state in order to strengthen the action 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.079
 only then will it obviously be the one who speaks who does it 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.710
 while when the shot 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.370
 the elysÃ©e a text 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.150
 if you read it before you see it all turn it into 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.139
 showing but most of the time you just do it 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.210
 we mental reading 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.139
 reading turning around me and at that moment it's the mandala effect of 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.800
 speech 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.020
 kiko primo by the fai will be missed 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.449
 and as I told you when I lent black mandalas 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.999
 I train mandala are intimately related 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.289
 so are still in Cairo 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.749
 chargers 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.979
 he who are unloaded an appearance that is to say archetypes 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.460
 and archetypes of emotions 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 a speech can move you 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.479
 eric symbolic discharge 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.150
 then we will follow and are different 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.400
 if archetypes are common to all humanity has more than one 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.759
 and are even beyond cultures 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.300
 the symbols they are restricted to cuts we understand some 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.319
 symbols because we are in a certain culture 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.720
 and the emotions she experiences them in relation to our own emotions 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.729
 interior yes there is a gradation
