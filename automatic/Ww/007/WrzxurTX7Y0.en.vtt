00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
now is you can see from the front of the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.130 
now is you can see from the front of the
work<00:03:03.379> we<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.129> chain<00:03:04.459> which<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.660> going<00:03:05.840> that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
work we have a chain which is going that

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.949 
work we have a chain which is going that
way<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.680> at<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.700> top<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.150> work<00:03:08.330> we<00:03:08.840> have<00:03:08.930> a

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
way and at the top of the work we have a

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.380 
way and at the top of the work we have a
chain<00:03:09.290> that's<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.220> way<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:11.209> have<00:03:11.360> a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
chain that's going that way so we have a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.710 
chain that's going that way so we have a
double<00:03:11.599> chain<00:03:11.989> one<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.099> front<00:03:13.280> one<00:03:13.700> on<00:03:14.599> the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
double chain one on the front one on the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.149 
double chain one on the front one on the
back<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.590> really<00:03:15.739> doesn't<00:03:15.950> matter

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
back and it really doesn't matter

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.949 
back and it really doesn't matter
whether<00:03:16.459> you've<00:03:16.640> knit<00:03:16.879> or<00:03:17.120> purl<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.659> chain

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
whether you've knit or purl the chain

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.050 
whether you've knit or purl the chain
continues<00:03:18.560> in<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.799> same<00:03:19.010> direction<00:03:19.250> because

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
continues in the same direction because

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.759 
continues in the same direction because
the<00:03:20.360> autores<00:03:20.900> all<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.379> same<00:03:21.590> direction

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
the autores all in the same direction

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.170 
the autores all in the same direction
it's<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.790> slightly<00:03:23.030> open<00:03:24.069> what<00:03:25.069> cast<00:03:25.760> off<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
it's a slightly open what cast off and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.240 
it's a slightly open what cast off and
it's<00:03:26.629> a<00:03:26.720> fairly<00:03:26.959> stretchy<00:03:27.349> cast<00:03:27.680> off<00:03:27.920> because

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
it's a fairly stretchy cast off because

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.170 
it's a fairly stretchy cast off because
the<00:03:28.370> yarn<00:03:28.489> over<00:03:28.819> provides<00:03:29.569> extra<00:03:30.019> ears<00:03:31.180> so

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
the yarn over provides extra ears so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.420 
the yarn over provides extra ears so
there's<00:03:32.420> they<00:03:32.690> new<00:03:32.930> cast<00:03:33.410> off<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:34.129> think

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
there's they new cast off that I think

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.520 
there's they new cast off that I think
is<00:03:34.549> just<00:03:34.790> absolutely<00:03:35.390> beautiful<00:03:35.530> it's
