think i would have liked to have seen
some<00:02:25.730> development<00:02:26.569> into<00:02:27.349> how<00:02:27.560> he<00:02:27.700> really

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
some development into how he really

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.699 
some development into how he really
handles<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.330> transition<00:02:29.930> because<00:02:30.410> you

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
handles that transition because you

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.309 
handles that transition because you
can't<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.160> wake<00:02:31.430> up<00:02:31.459> into<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> new<00:02:32.630> world<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
can't just wake up into a new world and

think<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.989> element<00:02:51.590> for<00:02:51.709> me<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.950> missing<00:02:52.190> but

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
think that element for me is missing but

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.490 
think that element for me is missing but
in<00:02:53.180> terms<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.599> this<00:02:53.720> movie<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.110> know<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.290> saw

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.330 
the trailer I think it to see a droid
suit<00:02:56.870> broken<00:02:57.170> from<00:02:57.410> what<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.590> heard<00:02:57.770> it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.949 
happened just before the game started
and<00:02:59.930> I<00:02:59.989> must<00:03:00.230> have<00:03:00.319> missed<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.040> um<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.330> got

to see it I after the game on a fox
website<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:07.190> looks<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:07.700> good<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:08.180> mean<00:03:08.930> I

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
website and I it looks so good I mean I

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.020 
website and I it looks so good I mean I
think<00:03:09.380> it's<00:03:09.680> gonna<00:03:09.830> do<00:03:10.040> better<00:03:10.250> than<00:03:10.400> Thor<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
think it's gonna do better than Thor the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.780 
think it's gonna do better than Thor the
dark<00:03:11.180> world<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.530> gonna<00:03:12.650> do<00:03:12.890> millions<00:03:13.700> of

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
dark world and it's gonna do millions of

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.820 
dark world and it's gonna do millions of
miles<00:03:14.000> better<00:03:14.420> than<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:15.140> think<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.680> first

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
miles better than I think the first

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.370 
miles better than I think the first
captain<00:03:16.130> america<00:03:16.670> which<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.720> good<00:03:18.080> because

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
captain america which is good because

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.670 
captain america which is good because
Captain<00:03:19.100> America<00:03:19.549> is<00:03:19.760> like<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.989> know<00:03:21.110> at<00:03:21.470> one

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
Captain America is like you know at one

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.860 
Captain America is like you know at one
time<00:03:21.709> he<00:03:22.190> was<00:03:22.220> Marvel's<00:03:22.790> flagship<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.750> know

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
time he was Marvel's flagship you know

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.190 
time he was Marvel's flagship you know
he<00:03:24.019> was<00:03:24.110> he<00:03:24.350> was<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.010> Marvel<00:03:25.519> man<00:03:25.730> and

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
he was he was the Marvel man and

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.380 
he was he was the Marvel man and
obviously<00:03:27.200> spider-man<00:03:27.799> took<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.220> over<00:03:28.390> some

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
obviously spider-man took that over some

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.360 
obviously spider-man took that over some
years<00:03:29.569> later<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.080> but<00:03:30.590> Captain<00:03:30.920> America<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.280> a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
years later and but Captain America is a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.940 
years later and but Captain America is a
great<00:03:31.400> superhero<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.540> think<00:03:33.260> Chris<00:03:33.440> Evans<00:03:33.650> has

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
great superhero I think Chris Evans has

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.120 
great superhero I think Chris Evans has
really<00:03:34.370> done<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.120> good<00:03:35.660> job<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:36.230> adopting<00:03:37.040> the

really done a good job of adopting the
character<00:03:37.580> when<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.239> consider<00:03:38.630> where<00:03:39.440> he

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
character when you consider where he

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.120 
character when you consider where he
came<00:03:39.830> from<00:03:39.890> with<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.640> Human<00:03:40.970> Torch<00:03:41.350> he's<00:03:42.350> kind

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
came from with the Human Torch he's kind

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.130 
came from with the Human Torch he's kind
of<00:03:43.220> gone<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.700> complete<00:03:44.239> opposite<00:03:44.750> route<00:03:44.959> like

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
of gone the complete opposite route like

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.020 
of gone the complete opposite route like
