00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.789

 of your savings and others 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.100

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.799
 time to spend your savings you put them 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.869
 some limitation on what 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.520
 do it or let them freely 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.640
 decide 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.460
 I tell him to buy what they need if 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.579
 you try to create awareness of what 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.110
 they need something that works for them or what 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.479
 they want but they spend less 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.719
 do with them what they want to spend you have 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.759
 savings this yes and in which you spend on 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.549
 that you would like to spend the for example 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.759
 in my supplies the tools that I need 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.159
 for example notebooks or things 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.079
 that they ask me in school or that the 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.659
 things good school looks like you 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.429
 you are excellent educating a great student 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.270
 here that thinks about your savings 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.270
 invest them in their education 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.070
 and that what they do as it inculcates them 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.560
 them how do you teach them to save to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.600
 manage your money is there any way in the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.090
 that there are them is educated so that they know 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.179
 how to handle your money silver 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 Well, more than anything, this I almost never 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.830
 I give them money and what we give them is 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.440
 mainly for them they save it in 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.750
 a piggy bank and and until the last they say 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.780
 Well, at each end of the year, I do not 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.569
 I want to buy clothes with this money and the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.790
 only we teach them because of another 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.650
 way we reach for saving 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.480
 so much for them but then they 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.890
 they have the behavior of knowing that during 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.900
 the year the money they give them is worth 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 piggy bank and already at the end of the year can 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.860
 decide on what to use it and if yes 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.349
 coincidentally they have some scholarship 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 because they are already free to spend it 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.950
 his taste and his way with what 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 they want but so that we 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.319
 that we give him we are giving 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.319
 consecutively, not 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.459
 with the money that he has earned 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.010
 budget and spent with 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.599
 responsibility something very important that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.140
 you must take into account is that children 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.140
 they learn 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.819
 the money of many coins a good 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.469
 start are on Sundays 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.469
 that can start from 3 years 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.250
 being of legal age 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.150
 and not waste to introduce them to 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.130
 concept of blur is important 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.170
 teach them not to damage or squander 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.720
 common or own books because they replace 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.030
 anything in milongas patience 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.700
 when I ask you something listen to it and 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.380

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.330
 a fashion toy tell her the name her 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.340
 Christmas birthday visit or end of 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.900
 courses that do not bring impetus to the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.540
 purchase of the object with your own money 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.459
 If you can not afford it, you should wait for a 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.480
 book or work to get more 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.480

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.549
