00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350 

I<00:00:00.380> did<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:02.100> recently<00:00:02.700> showing<00:00:03.090> this

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I did a video and recently showing this

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.780 
I did a video and recently showing this
little<00:00:03.659> device<00:00:04.529> here<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.330> it's<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.660> plug<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.500> a

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
little device here and it's a plug in a

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.860 
little device here and it's a plug in a
circuit<00:00:08.790> board<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.030> goes<00:00:09.269> straight<00:00:09.540> into<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
circuit board that goes straight into a

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.009 
circuit board that goes straight into a
USB<00:00:10.410> power<00:00:11.340> supply<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.389> lights<00:00:12.599> up<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
USB power supply and it lights up and

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.490 
USB power supply and it lights up and
the<00:00:13.259> reason<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.620> made<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:13.860> part<00:00:14.400> from<00:00:14.580> testing

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
the reason I made that part from testing

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
the reason I made that part from testing
algebra<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:16.560> exposure<00:00:16.920> unit<00:00:17.130> was<00:00:18.029> because<00:00:18.330> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
algebra at exposure unit was because I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.420 
algebra at exposure unit was because I
placed<00:00:18.990> an<00:00:19.109> order<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.500> some<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.800> these<00:00:20.039> from

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
placed an order for some of these from

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300 
placed an order for some of these from
China<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.230> they<00:00:22.230> hadn't<00:00:22.590> arrived<00:00:22.859> yet<00:00:23.160> they

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
China and they hadn't arrived yet they

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.620 
China and they hadn't arrived yet they
actually<00:00:23.609> took<00:00:23.760> quite<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> time<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> arrive

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
actually took quite a time to arrive

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.730 
actually took quite a time to arrive
it's<00:00:24.840> quite<00:00:25.080> annoying<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.500> I've<00:00:25.560> got<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it's quite annoying but I've got a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.980 
it's quite annoying but I've got a
selection<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.220> these<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.359> what<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.689> are

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
selection of these and what they are are

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.110 
selection of these and what they are are
the<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.769> USB<00:00:29.099> lights<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.859> they<00:00:31.859> basically

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
the little USB lights and they basically

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.680 
the little USB lights and they basically
shove<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> USB<00:00:34.559> power<00:00:34.950> supply<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.690> image

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
shove in to a USB power supply and image

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.490 
shove in to a USB power supply and image
huge<00:00:36.989> quantities<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> light<00:00:38.600> let's<00:00:39.600> say<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
huge quantities of light let's say do a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.440 
huge quantities of light let's say do a
quick<00:00:40.890> power<00:00:41.250> test<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.420> how

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
quick power test in this and see how

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.069 
quick power test in this and see how
much<00:00:42.780> current<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.320> checking<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> these<00:00:45.809> ones

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
much current of checking so these ones

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.459 
much current of checking so these ones
are<00:00:47.809> I'll<00:00:48.809> turn<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.260> over<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:51.469> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
are I'll turn now over actually and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.250 
are I'll turn now over actually and
these<00:00:53.309> ones<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.730> drawing<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.329> hundred<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.989> ten

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
these ones are drawing a hundred and ten

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
these ones are drawing a hundred and ten
mill<00:00:55.559> amps<00:00:56.780> now<00:00:57.780> you'll<00:00:58.680> notice<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.070> turn<00:00:59.550> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
mill amps now you'll notice I turn that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.959 
mill amps now you'll notice I turn that
over<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.840> still<00:01:01.140> remained<00:01:01.469> lit<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
over and it still remained lit and this

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.469 
over and it still remained lit and this
explains<00:01:03.660> why<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:05.159> had<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.640> components<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
explains why it had some components in

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.460 
explains why it had some components in
the<00:01:06.570> listing<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.260> actually

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the listing that I can actually

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200 
the listing that I can actually
represent<00:01:07.860> work<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> function<00:01:09.030> wise

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
represent work out with a function wise

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
represent work out with a function wise
there's<00:01:10.170> two<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.530> devices<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
there's two little devices here that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.539 
there's two little devices here that
turn<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.909> diodes<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:14.040> reason<00:01:14.340> for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
turn out to be diodes and the reason for

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
turn out to be diodes and the reason for
that<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> plug<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that is that there you can plug it in

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.359 
that is that there you can plug it in
either<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.740> when<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> plug<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> into

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
either around and when you plug it into

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.410 
either around and when you plug it into
the<00:01:20.549> USB<00:01:20.820> port<00:01:21.140> there's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.229> metal<00:01:22.530> housing<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
the USB port there's a metal housing and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.429 
the USB port there's a metal housing and
technically<00:01:24.420> speaking<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.930> shorting<00:01:25.290> these

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
technically speaking it's shorting these

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
technically speaking it's shorting these
contacts<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> back<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> two

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
contacts in the back out now the two

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.899 
contacts in the back out now the two
data<00:01:27.780> ones<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> middle<00:01:28.530> em<00:01:28.799> aren't<00:01:29.670> too

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
data ones in the middle em aren't too

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.310 
data ones in the middle em aren't too
critical<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:31.020> they're<00:01:31.229> not

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
critical because then they're not

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.530 
critical because then they're not
connected<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> anything<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.090> negative

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
connected to anything and the negative

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.999 
connected to anything and the negative
isn't<00:01:33.930> critical<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.799> not

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
isn't critical because it's not

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560 
isn't critical because it's not
connected<00:01:35.400> well<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> mean<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.030> connected<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
connected well I mean it's connected to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
connected well I mean it's connected to
the<00:01:37.439> circuitry<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.490> connected<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the circuitry but it's also connected to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
the circuitry but it's also connected to
the<00:01:39.180> shell<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:39.990> doesn't<00:01:40.229> matter

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the shell in here so it doesn't matter

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.499 
the shell in here so it doesn't matter
it<00:01:40.619> shorts<00:01:40.890> against<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it shorts against it but what is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
it shorts against it but what is
critical<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> positive<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.189> two

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
critical is it positive and the two

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.510 
critical is it positive and the two
diodes<00:01:44.820> are<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.990> isolate<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> positives<00:01:47.369> for

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
diodes are to isolate the positives for

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880 
diodes are to isolate the positives for
each<00:01:47.640> other<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> put<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
each other and so that when you put it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
each other and so that when you put it
in<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.130> doesn't<00:01:50.399> short<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.149> I've<00:01:51.600> got

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
in it doesn't short out and I've got

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.010 
in it doesn't short out and I've got
every<00:01:52.110> sketch<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.860> did<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> there's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
every sketch I did of this so there's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.100 
every sketch I did of this so there's
the<00:01:55.170> front<00:01:55.430> USB<00:01:56.450> connection<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> two

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the front USB connection with the two

the back one the to negative connections

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.429 
the back one the to negative connections
are<00:02:03.030> connect<00:02:03.329> together<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> two

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
are connect together but the two

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.350 
are connect together but the two
positives<00:02:05.009> go<00:02:05.219> through<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> diode<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
positives go through the diode and that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
positives go through the diode and that
is<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.049> assays<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.129> put<00:02:08.700> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
is just as assays so that if you put it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.240 
is just as assays so that if you put it

LEDs<00:02:26.829> now<00:02:27.640> I've<00:02:27.879> shown<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.629> LEDs<00:02:28.930> as<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> single

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
LEDs now I've shown the LEDs as a single

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220 
LEDs now I've shown the LEDs as a single
LED<00:02:29.829> but<00:02:30.010> inside<00:02:30.970> these<00:02:31.180> chips<00:02:31.689> there<00:02:32.109> are

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
LED but inside these chips there are

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.289 
LED but inside these chips there are
actually<00:02:32.590> two<00:02:32.799> LEDs<00:02:33.189> in<00:02:33.430> parallel<00:02:33.939> which<00:02:34.150> is

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
actually two LEDs in parallel which is

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.390 
actually two LEDs in parallel which is
quite<00:02:34.510> unusual<00:02:34.689> a<00:02:35.019> distinctive<00:02:35.950> dot<00:02:36.159> of<00:02:36.340> light

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
quite unusual a distinctive dot of light

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.610 
quite unusual a distinctive dot of light
each<00:02:36.730> end<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.239> don't<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.780> all<00:02:37.930> show<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.439> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
each end I don't have all show up in the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.129 
each end I don't have all show up in the
camera<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.670> they'll<00:02:40.180> probably<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.599> Swamper

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
camera not they'll probably just Swamper

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.470 
camera not they'll probably just Swamper
out<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.950> yes<00:02:42.879> quite<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:44.139> swath<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:45.040> light

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
out but and yes quite a swath of light

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.860 
out but and yes quite a swath of light
so<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:47.079> quite<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.379> neat<00:02:47.560> little<00:02:47.650> thing<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
so it's quite a neat little thing but it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.770 
so it's quite a neat little thing but it
doesn't<00:02:50.049> stop<00:02:50.409> there<00:02:50.709> they<00:02:51.549> also<00:02:51.760> do<00:02:52.180> this

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
doesn't stop there they also do this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.920 
doesn't stop there they also do this
version<00:02:53.079> which<00:02:53.889> has<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.760> light<00:02:55.180> sensor<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
version which has a light sensor in the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.920 
version which has a light sensor in the
back<00:02:56.139> and<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:57.489> little<00:02:57.609> potentiometer<00:02:58.450> tang<00:02:58.840> you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
back and a little potentiometer tang you

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.170 
back and a little potentiometer tang you
attain<00:02:59.169> shorter<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.769> switching<00:03:00.700> transistor

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
attain shorter a switching transistor

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.690 
attain shorter a switching transistor
and<00:03:01.359> a<00:03:01.419> buffering<00:03:01.810> transistor<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.500> as<00:03:03.400> you've

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
and a buffering transistor and as you've

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.300 
and a buffering transistor and as you've
probably<00:03:03.730> guessed<00:03:04.209> already<00:03:05.040> when<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.129> plug

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
probably guessed already when you plug

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.050 
probably guessed already when you plug
it<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.579> if<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:06.909> shoot<00:03:07.419> it<00:03:07.569> from<00:03:07.689> late<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.470> me

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
it in if you shoot it from late and I me

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.369 
it in if you shoot it from late and I me
have<00:03:10.060> going<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.359> have<00:03:10.419> to<00:03:10.659> really<00:03:11.079> try<00:03:11.349> and

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
have going to have to really try and

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.580 
have going to have to really try and
shield<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.950> get<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.189> too<00:03:12.310> late<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:14.019> almost

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
shield it to get it too late but almost

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.599 
shield it to get it too late but almost
almost<00:03:14.859> almost<00:03:15.329> no<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:16.569> really<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:18.250> just

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
almost almost no it's really it just

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.360 
almost almost no it's really it just
starts<00:03:19.090> glowing<00:03:19.389> em<00:03:19.750> at<00:03:20.019> when<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:20.889> dark<00:03:21.129> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
starts glowing em at when it's dark it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.949 
starts glowing em at when it's dark it
gradually<00:03:21.819> gets<00:03:22.030> progressively<00:03:22.299> brighter

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
gradually gets progressively brighter

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.899 
gradually gets progressively brighter
and<00:03:23.620> that's<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:24.040> at<00:03:24.159> its<00:03:24.310> most<00:03:24.430> sensitive

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
and that's it at its most sensitive

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.319 
and that's it at its most sensitive
setting<00:03:25.419> okay<00:03:25.900> we<00:03:26.500> had<00:03:26.709> some<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.220> yep<00:03:27.909> so<00:03:28.180> em

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
setting okay we had some there yep so em

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.839 
setting okay we had some there yep so em
it's<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.650> basic<00:03:30.220> comes<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.549> when<00:03:30.729> it<00:03:30.819> gets

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
it's a basic comes on when it gets

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.059 
it's a basic comes on when it gets
direct<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.569> then<00:03:32.139> there's<00:03:32.349> this<00:03:32.590> one<00:03:32.829> which

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
direct and then there's this one which

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.479 
direct and then there's this one which
is<00:03:33.129> really<00:03:33.459> quite<00:03:33.729> smart<00:03:34.629> it's<00:03:35.500> got<00:03:35.799> six<00:03:36.069> LEDs

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
is really quite smart it's got six LEDs

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.399 
is really quite smart it's got six LEDs
all<00:03:36.760> wired<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.299> parallel<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:38.019> single

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
standard pin out of a pic twelve so I'm

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.390 
standard pin out of a pic twelve so I'm
not<00:03:48.609> sure<00:03:48.669> what<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.709> but<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.040> I'll<00:03:51.220> turn

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
not sure what this is but and I'll turn

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.390 
not sure what this is but and I'll turn
this<00:03:51.549> upside<00:03:52.120> down<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:52.659> not<00:03:52.810> too<00:03:52.959> bright

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
this upside down so it's not too bright

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.000 
this upside down so it's not too bright
if<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.549> plug<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.909> in<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.329> doesn't<00:03:55.750> light<00:03:55.930> up

but if you touch the back of it it

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.979 
but if you touch the back of it it
gradually<00:04:00.129> ramps<00:04:00.579> up<00:04:00.760> from<00:04:01.060> off<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.780> full

gradually ramps up from off to full

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.750 
gradually ramps up from off to full
brightness<00:04:02.139> and<00:04:02.650> if<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:03.220> touch<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.639> back

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
brightness and if you touch the back

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.379 
brightness and if you touch the back
again<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.989> dims<00:04:05.409> out<00:04:05.650> again<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.729> it's<00:04:06.909> this

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
again it dims out again so it's this

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.409 
again it dims out again so it's this

they got a little make a controller I

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.580 
they got a little make a controller I
mean<00:04:10.419> it's<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.689> sort<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:10.900> thing<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.109> pic<00:04:11.290> twelve

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.080 
mean it's the sort of thing a pic twelve
could<00:04:11.799> do<00:04:12.009> but<00:04:12.220> I'm<00:04:12.370> not<00:04:12.579> going<00:04:12.759> to<00:04:12.790> percent

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
could do but I'm not going to percent

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.969 
could do but I'm not going to percent
sure<00:04:13.389> what<00:04:13.419> it<00:04:13.659> actually<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:14.049> because<00:04:14.560> that

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
sure what it actually is because that

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.460 
sure what it actually is because that
the<00:04:15.489> little<00:04:15.759> chip<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:16.449> also<00:04:16.720> doing<00:04:17.199> the

the little chip is also doing the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.120 
the little chip is also doing the
sensing<00:04:18.509> so<00:04:19.509> I'm<00:04:19.959> not<00:04:20.139> on<00:04:20.199> a<00:04:20.349> percent<00:04:20.680> sure<00:04:20.979> if

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
that's a dedicated chip or not but

that's a dedicated chip or not but

six<00:04:37.360> millimeters<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.860> had<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.220> pack<00:04:39.430> that

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
six millimeters and I had to pack that

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.160 
six millimeters and I had to pack that
up<00:04:39.820> with<00:04:39.970> tape<00:04:40.240> now<00:04:40.480> I've<00:04:40.600> got<00:04:40.780> digital

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
up with tape now I've got digital

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.700 
up with tape now I've got digital
calipers<00:04:41.560> here<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:46.260> starting<00:04:47.260> off<00:04:47.410> at

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
calipers here and and starting off at

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.120 
calipers here and and starting off at
the<00:04:47.980> one<00:04:48.250> point<00:04:48.550> six<00:04:48.640> millimeters<00:04:49.180> OOP<00:04:50.170> slips

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
the one point six millimeters OOP slips

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.690 
the one point six millimeters OOP slips
out<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:53.440> that's<00:04:53.590> one<00:04:53.800> point<00:04:54.010> five<00:04:54.280> nine<00:04:54.310> one

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
out so that's one point five nine one

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.660 
out so that's one point five nine one
point<00:04:54.970> six<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:56.620> had<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:57.010> pack<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:57.400> up<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:59.670> two

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
point six and I had to pack it up to two

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.600 
point six and I had to pack it up to two
point<00:05:00.910> two<00:05:01.240> two<00:05:01.540> millimeters<00:05:02.500> as<00:05:02.710> what<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.490> was

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
point two two millimeters as what it was

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.240 
point two two millimeters as what it was
in<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.820> end<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.570> that<00:05:04.600> equates<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.380> point

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
in the end and that equates to point

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.590 
in the end and that equates to point
zero<00:05:06.940> eight<00:05:07.240> seven<00:05:07.780> inches<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:10.000> just<00:05:10.300> under<00:05:10.540> a

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
zero eight seven inches so just under a

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.290 
zero eight seven inches so just under a
tenth<00:05:10.840> of<00:05:10.960> an<00:05:11.080> inch<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.880> that's<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.090> point

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
tenth of an inch and that's the point

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
tenth of an inch and that's the point
that<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.660> was<00:05:13.750> still<00:05:14.080> wobbly<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:15.070> the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
that it was still wobbly in the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.080 
that it was still wobbly in the
connector<00:05:17.320> but<00:05:18.100> it<00:05:18.190> went<00:05:18.340> him<00:05:18.580> quite<00:05:18.850> easily

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
connector but it went him quite easily

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.930 
connector but it went him quite easily
but<00:05:19.420> was<00:05:19.570> quite<00:05:19.810> loose<00:05:20.260> ish<00:05:20.440> but<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.430> didn't

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
but was quite loose ish but I didn't

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.340 
but was quite loose ish but I didn't
want<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.090> make<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.300> too<00:05:22.570> thick<00:05:22.840> in<00:05:22.990> case<00:05:23.170> I

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
want to make it too thick in case I

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.320 
want to make it too thick in case I
ended<00:05:23.500> up<00:05:23.710> mattering<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.280> connector<00:05:24.670> but<00:05:25.240> it

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
ended up mattering the connector but it

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.230 
ended up mattering the connector but it
turns<00:05:25.540> out<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:25.900> these<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.880> if<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:27.970> put<00:05:28.150> it

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
turns out that these and if I put it

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.880 
turns out that these and if I put it
back<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.600> inch<00:05:28.720> setting<00:05:29.200> these<00:05:29.860> are

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
back to the inch setting these are

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.780 
back to the inch setting these are
pretty<00:05:32.890> much<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:34.740> tenth<00:05:35.740> of<00:05:35.860> an<00:05:35.980> inch<00:05:36.070> thick<00:05:36.490> and

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
pretty much a tenth of an inch thick and

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.000 
pretty much a tenth of an inch thick and
that<00:05:37.480> equates<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:37.960> about<00:05:38.080> two<00:05:38.440> point<00:05:38.710> five

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
that equates to about two point five

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.340 
that equates to about two point five
millimeters<00:05:39.820> just<00:05:40.360> over<00:05:40.600> two<00:05:40.750> point<00:05:40.900> five<00:05:41.110> I'd

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
millimeters just over two point five I'd

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.410 
millimeters just over two point five I'd
typically<00:05:42.220> would<00:05:42.400> be<00:05:42.490> two<00:05:42.670> point<00:05:42.880> five<00:05:43.090> four

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
typically would be two point five four

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.750 
typically would be two point five four
millimeters<00:05:43.870> but<00:05:44.740> mmm<00:05:45.040> that's<00:05:45.310> just<00:05:45.580> not

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
millimeters but mmm that's just not

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.270 
millimeters but mmm that's just not
going<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.030> be<00:05:46.870> quite<00:05:47.200> there<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.680> tolerances

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280

wise<00:06:03.670> and<00:06:05.280> they're<00:06:06.280> just<00:06:06.700> again<00:06:07.660> under<00:06:08.170> half

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
wise and they're just again under half

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.690 
wise and they're just again under half
an<00:06:08.680> inch<00:06:08.830> wide<00:06:09.900> which<00:06:10.900> air<00:06:11.140> in<00:06:11.410> the<00:06:11.710> metric

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
an inch wide which air in the metric

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.720 
an inch wide which air in the metric
setting<00:06:12.880> would<00:06:13.180> be<00:06:13.620> 12<00:06:14.620> millimeters<00:06:15.220> wide

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
setting would be 12 millimeters wide

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.170 
setting would be 12 millimeters wide
so<00:06:16.420> yeah<00:06:16.990> interesting<00:06:17.890> but<00:06:18.580> thicker<00:06:18.940> than<00:06:19.120> I

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
so yeah interesting but thicker than I

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.490 
so yeah interesting but thicker than I
was<00:06:19.300> expecting<00:06:19.390> I<00:06:19.900> have<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.170> say<00:06:20.320> when<00:06:20.440> you

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
was expecting I have to say when you

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.880 
was expecting I have to say when you
push<00:06:20.710> them<00:06:20.920> in<00:06:21.040> to<00:06:21.370> the<00:06:22.290> connector<00:06:23.290> I<00:06:23.320> actually

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
push them in to the connector I actually

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.350 
push them in to the connector I actually
thought<00:06:24.160> it<00:06:24.220> was<00:06:24.310> just<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.610> wee<00:06:24.700> bit<00:06:24.730> too<00:06:24.910> tight

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
thought it was just a wee bit too tight

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.100 
thought it was just a wee bit too tight
it<00:06:25.600> felt<00:06:25.900> really<00:06:26.400> snug<00:06:27.400> but<00:06:28.090> I<00:06:28.120> guess<00:06:28.300> that

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
it felt really snug but I guess that

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.980 
it felt really snug but I guess that
must<00:06:29.380> probably<00:06:29.710> be<00:06:30.810> compliant<00:06:31.810> with<00:06:31.900> the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
must probably be compliant with the

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.540 
must probably be compliant with the
specification<00:06:32.800> or<00:06:32.890> maybe<00:06:33.100> it's<00:06:33.250> just<00:06:33.340> because

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
specification or maybe it's just because

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.450 
specification or maybe it's just because
two<00:06:33.880> point<00:06:34.090> five<00:06:34.390> we

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
two point five we

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.510 
two point five we
the<00:06:36.020> milimeters<00:06:37.020> was<00:06:37.169> the<00:06:37.350> closest<00:06:38.340> they

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
the milimeters was the closest they

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.360 
the milimeters was the closest they
could<00:06:38.699> get<00:06:39.240> to<00:06:39.509> the<00:06:39.539> correct<00:06:39.930> size<00:06:40.229> but<00:06:41.220> I'm

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
could get to the correct size but I'm

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.430 
could get to the correct size but I'm
not<00:06:41.580> sure<00:06:41.850> what<00:06:42.030> the<00:06:42.240> USB<00:06:42.900> standard<00:06:43.199> is<00:06:43.410> I

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
not sure what the USB standard is I

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.469 
not sure what the USB standard is I
didn't<00:06:43.710> actually<00:06:43.830> check<00:06:44.250> it<00:06:44.460> but<00:06:45.090> it's<00:06:45.270> quite

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
didn't actually check it but it's quite

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.320 
didn't actually check it but it's quite
a<00:06:45.509> snug<00:06:45.810> fit<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.580> I<00:06:47.580> guess<00:06:47.759> that's<00:06:47.940> what<00:06:48.210> it's

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
a snug fit and I guess that's what it's

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.730 
a snug fit and I guess that's what it's
supposed<00:06:48.599> to<00:06:48.660> be<00:06:48.810> but<00:06:49.229> they're<00:06:49.349> quite<00:06:49.530> neat

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
supposed to be but they're quite neat

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.140 
supposed to be but they're quite neat
only<00:06:50.130> they're<00:06:50.400> quite<00:06:50.699> a<00:06:50.729> clever<00:06:50.940> little

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
only they're quite a clever little

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.300 
only they're quite a clever little
device
