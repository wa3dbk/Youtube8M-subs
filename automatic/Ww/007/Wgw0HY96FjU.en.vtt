00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone with you again for play in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.020
 once again playing five on this freddys 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.330
 3 I was looking for something new from what can 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.880
 it would make a theory and I still 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.410
 probably not many have discovered something 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.540
 noticed that there are several 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.240
 identical pictures hung by 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.949
 attraction and how did the phone tell us 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170
 guy is all thing we can see 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 in the attraction were taken from the past 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.640
 restaurants and I think can drawings 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.010
 drawing children and the workers themselves 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 pizzerias to show that this place 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 supposedly admired by children 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 thereby consolidate the belief of parents 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 that this place is best for 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 celebrating holidays with children is possible 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 drawings were painted by children but in every 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 case, they were copied but still 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 inscription may d &amp; g new freddie fasber pizza 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 was made by computer workers 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.730
 pizzerias as she attends 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.039
 all drawings 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 but maybe the boards were issued to children already 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.899
 these inscriptions and they painted on them 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.390
 of course we can say that Scott himself 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 cavton developer five to this freddy's 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 just copied the pictures to not 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.900
 coming up with new but could just do 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
 fewer drawings thereby made in 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 each drawing is unique to me 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.159
 copied the drawings specifically to give 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.930
 some clue that would hint to us 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.390
 the fact that in this pizzeria is not so 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.909
 just well then let's see it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.490
 this is actually starting with five night at 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.710
 freddys 2 pictures we can see in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 office prize room children's bay and in 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 game room number four many 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 drawings are simply copied from each other 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.770
 example of drawings with a puppet which 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 leans towards the child to give 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.820
 a gift for three 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 a drawings with jumping out of the box 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.869
 two puppet 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.180
 and this is not all copied pictures 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.790
 five night at freddy's one drawings 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.009
 can be seen in the left corridor at all 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.329
 also they are in the right corridor well them 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.909
 impossible to see 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.369
 take for example drawing fail it is not 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 there is altogether and in the corridor or drawing 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.380
 Freddy with a gift in his hands he also has 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.020
 in the hallway and in our office and the inscription 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.689
 May, the fountain of all the pictures are the same 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.060
 except for the color of the words themselves well and in line 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.760
 five on this freddys 3 drawings can 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.390
 see in our office and on cameras 34 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.520
 him 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.800
 7 but unlike the first and second five 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.110
 on this freddys 3 copied pictures 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.480
 directed in different directions for example 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.000
 drawing he riot chambers number eight 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.790
 look one way she cameras number 3 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.650
 to another one, and now I will explain why mine 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.170
 opinion about who drew pictures 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.450
 diverges as we tell the phone 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.070
 guy five on this hadith 3 all things 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.750
 which we can see in the attraction 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.580
 were taken from the pizza place 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.380
 but what is strange are the pictures that we 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.540
 see five night at freddys 3 we don't 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.069
 could see in the last restaurant what 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.500
 says that these drawings were 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.750
 made by the workers themselves the rides and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.180
 copied but there is another assumption 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.580
 these drawings may have been hidden 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.769
 somewhere far away pizza workers 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.720
 since they were not needed by anyone and how 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.330
 we can see the pictures themselves do not look 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 very well take for example the drawing 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.980
 a collection that hangs on i camera number 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.660
 4 and on camera number 8 the paper itself is on 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.300
 which is a drawing apparently 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.010
 raw or just something soaked that 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.660
 says that this is a drawing and lay 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.880
 somewhere in a damp place for example in 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.040
 pantry but with one hundred percent confidence 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.200
 percent can say that a copy of it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.570
 drawing was done after it 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.459
 Employees of the attraction found as 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.410
 the smudges on the copy are the same as on 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.180
 original only sent to another 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.370
 aside as armor itself 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.040
 and before these drawings help them 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.470
 just could not be smudges incomprehensible 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 who drew pictures in all parts of five 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.190
 on this freddy's but you can say for sure 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840
 only one they were copied 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.730
 pizza workers 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.500
 well thanks for watching put 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.390
 big thumbs up subscribe to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.390
