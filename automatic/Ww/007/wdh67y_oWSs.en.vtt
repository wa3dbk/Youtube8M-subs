is of course customer service and being

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.130 
is of course customer service and being
able<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.949> fix<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.550> problem<00:01:00.030> people<00:01:00.899> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
able to fix the problem people are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.759 
able to fix the problem people are
inherently<00:01:01.469> lazy<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.570> inertia<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
inherently lazy and there is inertia and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
inherently lazy and there is inertia and
we<00:01:04.979> generally<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.360> change<00:01:07.110> even

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
we generally don't like to change even

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
we generally don't like to change even
if<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> means<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> changing<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
if that means you know changing to a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.710 
if that means you know changing to a
better<00:01:10.020> provider<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.250> 18t<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:12.119> does<00:01:12.390> need

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
better provider so 18t really does need

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
better provider so 18t really does need
to<00:01:12.780> fix<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.439> problem<00:01:13.799> otherwise<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.970> amount

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to fix the problem otherwise no amount

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
to fix the problem otherwise no amount
of<00:01:15.450> offers<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.900> unlimited<00:01:16.350> minutes<00:01:16.770> in

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
of offers and unlimited minutes in

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.080 
of offers and unlimited minutes in
rollover<00:01:17.310> minutes<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> make<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
rollover minutes is going to make a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.719 
rollover minutes is going to make a
difference<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> noticed<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> other<00:01:20.159> day<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
difference so I noticed the other day a
new<00:01:21.240> app<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.950> suppose<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.759> could

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
new app and you know I suppose I could

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
new app and you know I suppose I could
take<00:01:24.090> credit<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.080> wrote<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
piece on AT&amp;T and they put service and
then<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.930> spoke<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> couple<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> reporters

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.360 
here what I love about it is it's
actually<00:03:00.780> using<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.739> going<00:03:01.920> straight<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
actually using it's going straight to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.150 
actually using it's going straight to
you<00:03:03.330> know<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.660> source<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.140> breakdown<00:03:04.590> it's

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
you know that source of breakdown it's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.729 
you know that source of breakdown it's
using<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.730> iphone<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.140> time<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
using the iphone at the time that the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.400 
using the iphone at the time that the
problem<00:03:08.130> occurs<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.660> real<00:03:09.989> time

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
problem occurs so I like that real time

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.770 
problem occurs so I like that real time
resolution<00:03:11.220> they're<00:03:11.970> acknowledging<00:03:12.150> the

customer they're acknowledging the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.699 
customer they're acknowledging the
problem<00:03:14.550> it's<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.570> first<00:03:15.780> step<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.350> flipping

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
problem it's the first step in flipping

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.560 
problem it's the first step in flipping
the<00:03:16.800> funnel<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.850> other<00:03:18.000> thing<00:03:18.269> they're<00:03:18.420> doing

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
the funnel the other thing they're doing

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.650 
the funnel the other thing they're doing
is<00:03:18.840> potentially<00:03:19.739> engaging<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.940> dialogue<00:03:21.209> in
