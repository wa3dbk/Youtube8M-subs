a little harder they're adjusted the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.589 
a little harder they're adjusted the
truss<00:03:40.099> rod<00:03:40.250> when<00:03:40.640> I<00:03:40.670> put<00:03:40.940> these<00:03:41.060> strings<00:03:41.360> on

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
truss rod when I put these strings on

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.820 
truss rod when I put these strings on
because<00:03:41.810> they're<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:41.989> little<00:03:43.720> later<00:03:44.720> than<00:03:45.620> what

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
because they're a little later than what

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.430 
because they're a little later than what
was<00:03:45.980> on<00:03:46.130> there<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.790> truss<00:03:47.390> rod<00:03:47.630> works<00:03:47.870> fine<00:03:48.170> and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
was on there so truss rod works fine and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.000 
was on there so truss rod works fine and
gave<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.680> about<00:03:48.769> 1/4<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.550> 3/8<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:51.200> turn<00:03:51.470> loose
