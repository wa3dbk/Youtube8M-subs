reminds me sold out online sorta online

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.029 
reminds me sold out online sorta online

tuned<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.420> pretty<00:00:30.810> much<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.529> person

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
tuned is pretty much a first person

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.479 
tuned is pretty much a first person
shooter<00:00:32.120> without<00:00:33.120> guns<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> guess<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
shooter without guns so I guess it's a

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.650 
shooter without guns so I guess it's a
Bombur<00:00:35.489> maybe<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> cross

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
Bombur maybe it's kind of like a cross

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270 
Bombur maybe it's kind of like a cross
between<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.500> person<00:00:37.680> shooter<00:00:37.890> I'm

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
between a first person shooter I'm

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.610 
between a first person shooter I'm
Bomberman<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.570> pretty<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:39.870> only<00:00:40.230> can

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
Bomberman so they pretty much only can

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
Bomberman so they pretty much only can
use<00:00:40.829> bombs<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.489> grenades<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
use bombs and grenades I think it's a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
use bombs and grenades I think it's a
very<00:00:42.930> cool<00:00:43.200> concept<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.829> would<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
very cool concept it would actually be a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.130 
very cool concept it would actually be a
pretty<00:00:44.399> fun<00:00:44.850> game<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.180> play<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.870> later<00:00:46.110> on

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
pretty fun game to play but later on

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
pretty fun game to play but later on
becomes<00:00:46.620> much<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:47.129> than<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.579> game<00:00:47.789> for

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
becomes much more than just a game for

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.049 
becomes much more than just a game for
poor<00:00:48.629> hikikomori<00:00:49.289> main<00:00:50.219> character<00:00:50.789> he's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
up winning the only thing that i think

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
up winning the only thing that i think
could<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.420> better<00:01:54.720> about<00:01:55.020> this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
could be a little better about this

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800 
could be a little better about this
fight<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> main<00:01:56.520> character<00:01:57.000> got<00:01:57.240> hit<00:01:57.570> by

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
fight was the main character got hit by

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
fight was the main character got hit by
a<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:58.259> too<00:01:58.530> many<00:01:58.740> bombs<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.640> dude<00:01:59.880> just<00:01:59.909> kept

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
a bit too many bombs the dude just kept

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.880 
a bit too many bombs the dude just kept
throwing<00:02:00.390> bombs<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.990> him<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> seems<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.770> they

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
throwing bombs at him it seems like they

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.550 
throwing bombs at him it seems like they
would<00:02:02.009> always<00:02:02.579> land<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.899> front<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.500> him

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
would always land right in front of him

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
would always land right in front of him
so<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> explosion<00:02:05.579> would<00:02:05.640> go<00:02:05.820> off<00:02:06.030> he<00:02:06.240> would

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
so the explosion would go off he would

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.940 
so the explosion would go off he would
fly<00:02:06.570> somewhere<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.200> he<00:02:07.259> wouldn't<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.649> too

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
fly somewhere but he wouldn't be too

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
fly somewhere but he wouldn't be too
injured<00:02:08.550> he<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.940> kept<00:02:09.149> getting<00:02:09.270> blown<00:02:09.690> up

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
injured he just kept getting blown up

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630 
injured he just kept getting blown up
and<00:02:10.080> surviving<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.860> we've<00:02:10.979> been<00:02:11.069> pretty<00:02:11.340> cool

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and surviving so we've been pretty cool

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.700 
and surviving so we've been pretty cool
if<00:02:11.790> they<00:02:11.910> made<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.120> more

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
if they made it more

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.530 
if they made it more
istic<00:02:13.130> i<00:02:13.310> think<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.910> beginning<00:02:14.000> when<00:02:14.330> i<00:02:14.390> do

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
istic i think in the beginning when i do

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.060 
istic i think in the beginning when i do
through<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> first<00:02:15.080> few<00:02:15.290> bombs<00:02:15.530> at<00:02:15.770> him<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
through the first few bombs at him it

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.650 
through the first few bombs at him it
should<00:02:16.100> have<00:02:16.340> missed<00:02:16.730> more<00:02:17.150> instead<00:02:17.540> of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
should have missed more instead of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300 
should have missed more instead of
landing<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.290> front<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> him<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.160> then

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
landing right in front of him so then

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.250 
landing right in front of him so then
when<00:02:19.520> he<00:02:19.580> actually<00:02:19.790> got<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.570> landed<00:02:20.930> right

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
when he actually got it so landed right

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
when he actually got it so landed right
next<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.040> blew<00:02:22.280> him<00:02:22.400> up<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:22.790> didn't

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
next to and blew him up but didn't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.490 
next to and blew him up but didn't
injure<00:02:23.330> them<00:02:23.450> too<00:02:23.600> badly<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:24.200> would<00:02:24.320> make

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
injure them too badly it would make

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.740 
injure them too badly it would make
sense<00:02:24.530> but<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.700> have<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:26.030> 10<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.630> those

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
sense but when you have like 10 of those

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.660 
sense but when you have like 10 of those
close<00:02:27.110> calls<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.740> becomes<00:02:28.010> harder<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.460> believe

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
close calls it becomes harder to believe

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.030 
close calls it becomes harder to believe
and<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.120> takes<00:02:29.360> away<00:02:29.690> from<00:02:30.230> how<00:02:30.440> awesome<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and it takes away from how awesome the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.800 
and it takes away from how awesome the
fight<00:02:31.310> was<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.180> don't<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.630> I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
fight was and I don't really know if I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.450 
fight was and I don't really know if I
should<00:02:32.840> call<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.350> fight<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.130> don't<00:02:34.400> know

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
should call it a fight but I don't know

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.620 
should call it a fight but I don't know
what<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.610> should<00:02:34.670> call<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.270> way<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.480> main

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
what I should call it the way the main

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.270 
what I should call it the way the main
character<00:02:35.990> wins<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.320> awesome<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.770> overall<00:02:37.130> is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
character wins is awesome and overall is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.010 
character wins is awesome and overall is
a<00:02:37.370> very<00:02:37.550> cool<00:02:37.730> fight<00:02:38.030> scene<00:02:38.300> though<00:02:38.600> after

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
a very cool fight scene though after

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.330 
a very cool fight scene though after
that<00:02:39.170> he<00:02:39.260> starts<00:02:39.530> throwing<00:02:39.680> up<00:02:40.040> because<00:02:40.160> he

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
that he starts throwing up because he

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.280 
that he starts throwing up because he
saw<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.550> dudes<00:02:40.910> remains<00:02:41.360> floating<00:02:41.960> next<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
saw the dudes remains floating next to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.260 
saw the dudes remains floating next to
him<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.530> water<00:02:42.710> this<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.400> problematic

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
him in the water this is problematic

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.420 
him in the water this is problematic
because<00:02:44.480> they<00:02:44.780> only<00:02:44.930> gave<00:02:45.230> him<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.530> lunch<00:02:46.100> and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
because they only gave him one lunch and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.370 
because they only gave him one lunch and
he<00:02:46.580> just<00:02:46.790> threw<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.090> up<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.750> wonder<00:02:48.050> if<00:02:48.260> in

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
he just threw it up so I wonder if in

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.960 
he just threw it up so I wonder if in
later<00:02:48.590> episodes<00:02:48.680> there'll<00:02:49.460> be<00:02:49.490> more<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.820> an

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
later episodes there'll be more of an

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.180 
later episodes there'll be more of an
emphasis<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.660> trying<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.080> find<00:02:51.350> food<00:02:51.920> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
emphasis on trying to find food and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.950 
emphasis on trying to find food and
clean<00:02:52.490> water<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:53.120> seems<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.480> at<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> end<00:02:53.780> of

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
clean water it seems like at the end of

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.030 
clean water it seems like at the end of
this<00:02:54.020> episode<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.440> found<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.710> source<00:02:54.920> of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
this episode you found the source of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.230 
this episode you found the source of
clean<00:02:55.250> water<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.790> shouldn't<00:02:56.060> be<00:02:56.210> a

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.300 
clean water so that shouldn't be a
problem<00:02:56.300> in<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.350> rest<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.680> series<00:02:57.950> but

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
problem in the rest of the series but

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.740 
problem in the rest of the series but
what<00:02:58.460> about<00:02:58.670> food<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.150> think<00:02:59.450> they'll<00:02:59.570> have<00:02:59.660> to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
what about food I think they'll have to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.570 
what about food I think they'll have to
find<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.170> balance<00:03:00.410> they<00:03:00.830> can't<00:03:01.070> show<00:03:01.370> him

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
find a balance they can't show him

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.700 
find a balance they can't show him
hunting<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.330> food<00:03:02.600> pretty<00:03:03.200> much<00:03:03.320> every

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
hunting for food pretty much every

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.440 
hunting for food pretty much every
episode<00:03:04.160> because<00:03:04.340> he<00:03:04.520> always<00:03:04.670> needs<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.180> eat

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
episode because he always needs to eat

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.360 
episode because he always needs to eat
but<00:03:05.750> they<00:03:05.930> can't<00:03:06.200> just<00:03:06.260> completely<00:03:06.740> disregard

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
but they can't just completely disregard

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.740 
but they can't just completely disregard
that<00:03:07.550> problem<00:03:08.030> because<00:03:08.300> they<00:03:08.450> made<00:03:08.630> it

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
