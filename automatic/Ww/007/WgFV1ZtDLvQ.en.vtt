00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.290 
just both have the same name call of
duty<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.079> they're<00:00:55.260> technically<00:00:55.910> new<00:00:56.910> games

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
duty but they're technically new games

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.830 
duty but they're technically new games
and<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.440> feel<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.920> call<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> duty<00:01:00.000> black<00:01:00.030> ops<00:01:00.329> 2

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and I feel that call of duty black ops 2

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.529 
and I feel that call of duty black ops 2
call<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> duty<00:01:01.469> black<00:01:01.649> ops<00:01:01.920> 2<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> be

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
call of duty black ops 2 is going to be

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.179 
call of duty black ops 2 is going to be
a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.930> similar<00:01:04.110> obviously<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.010> it's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a little similar obviously because it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.820 
a little similar obviously because it's
the<00:01:05.339> same<00:01:05.519> company<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.080> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the same company but it's going to be a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
the same company but it's going to be a
lot<00:01:08.220> different<00:01:08.280> because<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
lot different because it's it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
lot different because it's it's
different<00:01:10.290> time<00:01:10.470> zones<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> everything<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
different time zones and everything and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.260 
different time zones and everything and
I<00:01:12.510> feel<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.340> play<00:01:14.549> black<00:01:14.820> ops<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
I feel even if we do play black ops a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
I feel even if we do play black ops a
lot<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.720> wants<00:01:16.640> there's<00:01:17.640> no<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.240> actually

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
lot it wants there's no way of actually

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.910

not based on rank it's by based on best
connection<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.290> then<00:02:35.650> they<00:02:35.770> have<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.920> ranked

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
one win and they go negative all time so

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.210 
one win and they go negative all time so
it<00:02:55.180> should<00:02:55.330> be<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.690> lot<00:02:56.080> better<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.770> teammates

it should be a lot better for teammates
however<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.850> should<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.300> harder<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.930> get

however it should be a lot harder to get

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.470
