00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.520
 hello everyone this is a very short one 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.710
 video to let you see how I have it 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.510
 realized this simone truce 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.000
 specify that the idea is not entirely 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.320
 love me and reinterpreted having some 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.160
 video on reading anyway 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.349
 this article 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.600
 in short, if you like the idea if you do 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.460
 interested follow the tumor and do it 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
 know in the comments below what 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.250
 think of it 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.380
 I apologize for the 8,000 noises that you 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.770
 they will hear in this intro but they are in the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.010
 garden and there are parrot insects 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.250
 anyway I leave all the machines to you 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.630
 video we will first need a meter 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.320
 of the string some pins a needle of the 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.270
 scissors and obviously the fabric that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 that I chose was an old pareo 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.790
 which I never used in his 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.790
 existence 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.450
 this is the project we're going to 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.200
 follow 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.640
 I took a 144 cm cloth for 102 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.110
 folding the middle 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.209
 I will have 102 centimeters by 72 cm here it was 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.190
 a little is just 30 centimeters for the 

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:15.190
 sleeves to let the arms enter 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.110
 I measure with a meter and 30 centimeters and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.120
 firm the two ends of the fabric 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.120
 both with a pin 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.550
 birth with which to exit the corners of 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.360
 fabric that I chose by doing a little 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.360
 nodino 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.400
 ok after a decidedly sewing 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.590
 unprofessional all the side are 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.930
 arrived where I had positioned it 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.030
 pin here I will have to do another little one 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.850
 knot as I had already done at the beginning 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.850
 to make the sleeve hole form 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.140
 I repeat the exact same procedure 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.390
 both in the right car and in the side 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.140
 left of the fabric and we arrived 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.140
 to the final part 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.500
 calculate half and cut to the top 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.510
 only the first layer of the fabric mi 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 I recommend only the first state 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.110
 I send you a kiss
