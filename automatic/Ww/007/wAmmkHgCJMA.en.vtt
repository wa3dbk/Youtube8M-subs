suck<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.590> gonna<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.830> doing<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> RC<00:00:29.369> XD

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
suck so we're gonna be doing the RC XD

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.650 
suck so we're gonna be doing the RC XD
friendly<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.510> RC<00:00:30.929> XD<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.349> 450<00:00:32.040> points<00:00:32.279> in

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
friendly this RC XD is 450 points in

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.020 
friendly this RC XD is 450 points in
black<00:00:33.660> ops<00:00:33.809> 2<00:00:33.980> hundred<00:00:34.980> points<00:00:35.100> more<00:00:35.430> than<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
black ops 2 hundred points more than the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
black ops 2 hundred points more than the
UAV<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.690> i<00:00:36.719> believe<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.020> UAV<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.980> up

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
UAV but i believe that UAV is going up

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
UAV but i believe that UAV is going up
to<00:00:38.129> 400<00:00:38.670> points<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.030> it'd<00:00:39.120> only<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.360> 50<00:00:39.780> more

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to 400 points so it'd only be 50 more

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.150 
to 400 points so it'd only be 50 more
hardline<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.399> give<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> extra<00:00:42.180> points<00:00:43.160> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
hardline will give you extra points it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
hardline will give you extra points it
does<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.700> decrease<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.750> score<00:00:45.989> streak

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
does not just decrease the score streak

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
does not just decrease the score streak
requirement<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.460> these<00:00:47.670> scorestreaks

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
requirement for these scorestreaks

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.979 
requirement for these scorestreaks
donors<00:00:48.920> um<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> hundred<00:00:51.719> points

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
donors um so if you get a hundred points

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.560 
donors um so if you get a hundred points
with<00:00:52.680> hardline<00:00:53.129> you'll<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.430> 120<00:00:54.000> points<00:00:54.149> just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
with hardline you'll get 120 points just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.420 
with hardline you'll get 120 points just
twenty<00:00:54.899> percent<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> guys<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
twenty percent more if you guys want to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
twenty percent more if you guys want to
see<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> in-depth<00:00:57.570> type<00:00:57.870> video<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
see it like a in-depth type video of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
see it like a in-depth type video of
hardline<00:00:59.250> let<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.329> sure<00:01:00.480> if

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
hardline let me know not sure if

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
hardline let me know not sure if
anyone's<00:01:00.840> done<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.469> most<00:01:01.739> likely<00:01:01.949> someone

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
anyone's done it but most likely someone

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.039 
anyone's done it but most likely someone
has<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> RC<00:01:05.610> car<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> little<00:01:06.030> RC<00:01:06.450> car<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
has so the RC car is a little RC car you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
has so the RC car is a little RC car you
get<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> drive<00:01:07.530> around<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.890> black<00:01:08.070> ops<00:01:08.280> 2<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
get to drive around in black ops 2 is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
get to drive around in black ops 2 is
also<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.960> black<00:01:10.140> ops<00:01:10.380> 1<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.750> move<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.500> left

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
also in black ops 1 so you move the left

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.289 
also in black ops 1 so you move the left
stick<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.880> forward<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
stick up and down to go forward and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.149 
stick up and down to go forward and
backward<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.350> stick<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> control

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
backward and the right stick to control

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.100 
backward and the right stick to control
where<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.610> goes<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.299> turning<00:01:18.720> left<00:01:18.960> or

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
where it goes as I'm turning left or

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.280 
where it goes as I'm turning left or
right<00:01:19.320> stuff<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.930> they<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> also<00:01:22.200> be

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
right stuff like that they can also be

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
right stuff like that they can also be
detonated<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.070> by<00:01:23.159> hitting<00:01:23.310> RT<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> blowing

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
detonated just by hitting RT and blowing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
detonated just by hitting RT and blowing
up<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.780> small<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:25.650> explosion<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:26.880> can

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
up a small little explosion which can

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.010 
up a small little explosion which can
get<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> wonder<00:01:28.259> yes<00:01:29.329> six<00:01:30.329> kills<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> if

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
get you a wonder yes six kills that if

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
get you a wonder yes six kills that if
everyone's<00:01:31.439> standing<00:01:31.590> right<00:01:31.799> next<00:01:31.890> before

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
everyone's standing right next before

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.270 
everyone's standing right next before
they<00:01:32.970> could<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.140> six<00:01:34.650> kills<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.130> that's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
they could get you six kills but that's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
they could get you six kills but that's
very<00:01:35.610> unlikely<00:01:36.000> you'll<00:01:36.720> probably<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.229> or

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
very unlikely you'll probably get one or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.490 
very unlikely you'll probably get one or
two<00:01:37.409> kills<00:01:37.799> maybe<00:01:38.189> three<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.990> one<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
two kills maybe three but one or two is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
two kills maybe three but one or two is
the<00:01:41.750> main<00:01:42.770> kill<00:01:43.770> rate<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> RC<00:01:44.850> car<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.210> it's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the main kill rate of the RC car so it's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.179 
the main kill rate of the RC car so it's
not<00:01:45.509> too<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.140> might<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.439> well<00:01:46.590> use

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
not too good to have might as well use

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.310 
not too good to have might as well use
something<00:01:47.549> easier<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.600> UAV<00:01:49.079> or

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
something easier to get as the UAV or

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.010 
something easier to get as the UAV or
just<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> hunter<00:01:50.610> killer<00:01:50.880> drone

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
just go up to the hunter killer drone

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
just go up to the hunter killer drone
which<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:54.110> 525<00:01:55.110> points<00:01:55.380> instead<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.540> set<00:01:57.540> up

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
which is 525 points instead of I set up

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.349 
which is 525 points instead of I set up
for<00:01:57.840> 50<00:01:58.140> so

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
for 50 so

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.660 
for 50 so
the<00:02:00.359> RC<00:02:00.659> car<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.429> real

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the RC car I think that's all in real

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.080 
the RC car I think that's all in real
life<00:02:02.869> are<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:03.929> realized<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> game<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> RC

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
life are not realized the game so the RC

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.350 
life are not realized the game so the RC
part<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.659> real<00:02:07.140> life<00:02:07.380> doesn't<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.069> exist

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
part in real life doesn't really exist

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.119 
part in real life doesn't really exist
you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.539> buy<00:02:09.810> an<00:02:09.989> RC<00:02:10.259> car<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> scrap

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you can buy an RC car and scrap

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.339 
you can buy an RC car and scrap
explosives<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.970> c4<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.690> sim<00:02:12.870> text<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
explosives like c4 your sim text to it

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.740 
explosives like c4 your sim text to it
to<00:02:13.470> remotely<00:02:13.709> detonate<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.510> not

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
to remotely detonate it but that's not

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.839 
to remotely detonate it but that's not
you<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:17.040> know<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.489> not<00:02:17.640> widespread

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
you you know it's not widespread

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.809 
you you know it's not widespread
gorgeous<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.080> what<00:02:19.379> they<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.560> use<00:02:19.920> RC<00:02:20.310> cars<00:02:20.549> is

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
gorgeous so what they do use RC cars is

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.390 
gorgeous so what they do use RC cars is
in<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.750> life<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.410> figuring<00:02:23.250> out

what<00:02:27.360> i<00:02:27.390> mean<00:02:27.569> by<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.250> they<00:02:29.250> pull<00:02:29.519> up

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
what i mean by that is it they pull up

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.309 
what i mean by that is it they pull up
to<00:02:29.700> something<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.299> looks<00:02:30.599> like<00:02:30.690> an<00:02:30.840> IED<00:02:31.290> or

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.240 
be the first one of these robots that
were<00:03:45.660> invented<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.370> 1972<00:03:48.650> for<00:03:49.650> bombs<00:03:49.950> so

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
were invented was in 1972 for bombs so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.490 
were invented was in 1972 for bombs so
it<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.549> bending<00:03:51.450> or<00:03:51.599> does<00:03:51.720> active<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.079> long<00:03:52.290> time

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
it is bending or does active a long time

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.289 
it is bending or does active a long time
ago<00:03:52.650> they've<00:03:52.919> used<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.669> Bob's<00:03:53.880> not<00:03:54.150> like

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
ago they've used it for Bob's not like

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.140 
ago they've used it for Bob's not like
it<00:03:54.419> evolved<00:03:54.900> from<00:03:55.260> something<00:03:55.709> else<00:03:56.150> these

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
it evolved from something else these

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.110 
it evolved from something else these
works<00:03:57.569> so<00:03:57.810> they<00:03:57.959> can<00:03:58.109> figure<00:03:58.680> out<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.310> disarm

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
works so they can figure out and disarm

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.530 
works so they can figure out and disarm
or<00:04:00.630> whatever<00:04:00.930> bombs<00:04:01.639> so<00:04:02.639> important

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
or whatever bombs so important

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.350 
or whatever bombs so important
these<00:04:04.140> robots<00:04:04.530> also<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.640> something

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
these robots also can have something

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.970 
these robots also can have something
called<00:04:06.689> a<00:04:06.780> big<00:04:07.019> stick<00:04:07.290> which<00:04:07.469> is<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.680> british

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
called a big stick which is a british

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.009 
called a big stick which is a british
army<00:04:08.250> term<00:04:08.459> for<00:04:08.909> a<00:04:08.939> wet<00:04:09.359> water<00:04:10.049> jet<00:04:10.500> disrupter

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
army term for a wet water jet disrupter

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.610 
army term for a wet water jet disrupter
these<00:04:13.019> are<00:04:13.200> usually<00:04:13.709> on<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:15.229> robots<00:04:16.229> like<00:04:16.470> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
these are usually on the robots like a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.210 
these are usually on the robots like a
strike<00:04:16.859> against<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.579> IRA<00:04:18.000> bombs<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.600> nine

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
strike against the IRA bombs the nine

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.189 
strike against the IRA bombs the nine
1970s<00:04:20.220> um<00:04:20.479> so<00:04:21.479> after<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:21.840> was<00:04:21.989> made<00:04:22.169> they

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
1970s um so after this was made they

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.260 
1970s um so after this was made they
figured<00:04:22.650> out<00:04:22.770> something<00:04:23.039> like<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:26.270> doll

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
figured out something like a a a doll

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.379 
figured out something like a a a doll
explosively<00:04:28.259> pel<00:04:29.070> jet<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.340> water<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:30.150> what<00:04:30.300> it

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
explosively pel jet of water so what it

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.360 
explosively pel jet of water so what it
will<00:04:30.509> do<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.780> it'll<00:04:31.199> disrupt<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.889> circuitry

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
will do is it'll disrupt the circuitry

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.960 
will do is it'll disrupt the circuitry
of<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.729> bomb<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:34.110> what<00:04:34.949> will<00:04:35.100> happen<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.580> can

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
of a bomb so what will happen is it can

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.839 
of a bomb so what will happen is it can
disable<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.539> bottom<00:04:36.810> without<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:37.080> detonating

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
disable the bottom without a detonating

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.230 
disable the bottom without a detonating
but<00:04:38.849> it<00:04:39.449> can<00:04:39.690> still<00:04:39.840> detonate<00:04:40.110> there's<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.650> a

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
but it can still detonate there's like a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.140 
but it can still detonate there's like a
low<00:04:42.240> low<00:04:42.570> risk<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.380> detonating<00:04:44.060> but<00:04:45.060> it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
low low risk of a detonating but it

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.550 
low low risk of a detonating but it
comes<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.419> have<00:04:45.599> come<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.050> but<00:04:46.229> it's<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.440> lot

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
comes to have come to you but it's a lot

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.379 
comes to have come to you but it's a lot
safer<00:04:46.800> than<00:04:47.009> someone<00:04:47.460> actually<00:04:47.639> going<00:04:47.940> up<00:04:48.210> to

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
safer than someone actually going up to

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.490 
safer than someone actually going up to
it<00:04:48.419> friendly<00:04:49.199> UAV<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.680> um<00:04:50.509> so<00:04:51.509> it's<00:04:51.840> this

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
it friendly UAV and um so it's this

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.830 
it friendly UAV and um so it's this
thing<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.889> really<00:04:53.039> used<00:04:53.310> worldwide<00:04:53.490> it's<00:04:54.030> 485

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
thing is really used worldwide it's 485

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.180 
thing is really used worldwide it's 485
millimeters<00:04:55.289> long<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.860> weighs<00:04:56.009> about

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
millimeters long and it weighs about

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.260 
millimeters long and it weighs about
three<00:04:56.729> kilograms<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:58.050> made<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.410> metal<00:04:58.590> and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
three kilograms it's made of metal and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.409 
three kilograms it's made of metal and
it's<00:05:00.680> mounted<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:02.070> robot<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.180> I've<00:05:03.330> been

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
it's mounted on a robot that I've been

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.990 
it's mounted on a robot that I've been
talking<00:05:03.780> about<00:05:04.160> these<00:05:05.160> also<00:05:05.610> make<00:05:05.759> it<00:05:05.789> very

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
talking about these also make it very

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.210 
talking about these also make it very
effective<00:05:06.509> in<00:05:06.599> a<00:05:06.840> safe<00:05:07.199> way<00:05:07.229> to<00:05:07.410> disarm<00:05:07.949> a<00:05:08.190> bomb

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
effective in a safe way to disarm a bomb

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.050 
effective in a safe way to disarm a bomb
or<00:05:08.669> detonate<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.330> if<00:05:09.510> go<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.199> be<00:05:10.349> beat<00:05:10.909> so<00:05:11.909> no

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
or detonate it if go to be beat so no

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.909 
or detonate it if go to be beat so no
one<00:05:12.180> gets<00:05:12.210> hurt<00:05:12.389> but<00:05:13.229> there<00:05:13.440> are<00:05:13.560> some

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
one gets hurt but there are some

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.420 
one gets hurt but there are some
circumstances<00:05:14.280> where<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:15.030> robot<00:05:15.539> will<00:05:15.810> not

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
circumstances where a robot will not

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.240 
circumstances where a robot will not
actually<00:05:17.430> disarm<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.330> bomb<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.650> technician

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
actually disarm the bomb so a technician

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.649 
actually disarm the bomb so a technician
will<00:05:20.370> actually<00:05:20.669> have<00:05:20.760> to<00:05:20.820> put<00:05:21.000> themselves<00:05:21.360> at

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
will actually have to put themselves at

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.500 
will actually have to put themselves at
risk<00:05:22.080> by<00:05:22.590> going<00:05:22.620> near<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.159> bomb<00:05:23.430> by<00:05:24.030> himself

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
risk by going near the bomb by himself

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.520
