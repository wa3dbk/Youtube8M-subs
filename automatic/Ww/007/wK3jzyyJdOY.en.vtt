get<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> green<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:45.200> I'll<00:00:46.200> mask

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
get this green here and then I'll mask

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.910 
get this green here and then I'll mask
that<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:46.950> off<00:00:47.160> after<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:47.910> nice<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> dry<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
that all off after it's nice and dry and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.020 
that all off after it's nice and dry and
then<00:00:49.920> I'll<00:00:50.070> probably<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:52.670> engine<00:00:53.670> bay<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
then I'll probably do the engine bay and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.160 
then I'll probably do the engine bay and
whatnot<00:00:54.329> black<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> foot<00:00:57.840> pedals

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
whatnot black and then the foot pedals

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
whatnot black and then the foot pedals
there<00:00:58.320> those<00:00:58.590> should<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.250> black<00:00:59.520> they're

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there those should be black they're

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
there those should be black they're
obviously<00:01:00.570> primed<00:01:01.559> right<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.930> they

obviously primed right now and they

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920 
obviously primed right now and they
weren't<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:04.830> great<00:01:05.640> shape<00:01:06.000> anyway<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.479> it's

clearcoat<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> did<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> 214<00:01:40.439> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

you<00:01:41.540> look<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> video<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:44.189> think

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you look at that video I actually think

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
you look at that video I actually think
it<00:01:44.670> came<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:45.000> crappy<00:01:45.509> compared<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> regular

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it came out crappy compared to a regular

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
it came out crappy compared to a regular
paint<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.149> we're<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.540> regular

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
paint so we're gonna see what regular

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.130 
paint so we're gonna see what regular
paint<00:01:49.200> looks<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.820> man<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> take<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.509> look

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
paint looks like man if you take a look

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
paint looks like man if you take a look
back<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> John<00:01:52.979> Deere<00:01:53.009> 214<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.299> mean<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
back at the John Deere 214 I mean it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
back at the John Deere 214 I mean it
looked<00:01:54.840> good<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> wasn't<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.219> shiny

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
looked good but it wasn't that shiny

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
looked good but it wasn't that shiny
even<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.149> clear<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> used<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
even would clear out it but I used a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.020 
even would clear out it but I used a
spray<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.700> come<00:01:59.729> out<00:02:00.090> great<00:02:00.299> so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
spray can and then come out great so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.069 
spray can and then come out great so
