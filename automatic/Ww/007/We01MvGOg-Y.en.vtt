00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.900
 Welcome to another video of one of three 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 today we will solve a small 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.490
 problem related to what is required or 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 detection of walls that arose from 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 of the past video when we import the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.680
 Our character for the unite will 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.680
 demonstrate the problem 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 when my character moves to a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.470
 ramp detection of walls detects this 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.570
 ramp like a wall 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.489
 makes it impossible for the character to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.530
 ramp 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.570
 this is because the detection radius 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 of walls is being fired from 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.469
 player's feet 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 the way our game is now 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.450
 enriches that detects walls is 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 shot from the character's foot hillside 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.730
 ramp and thus the ramp detected with a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.829
 wall what for our character 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 prevents him from climbing the ramp when he 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 slope on the ramp he thinks it 's a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.350
 wall and for all 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.899
 character 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.270
 the rick is if by default it is triggered to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.770
 from the pivot point of your object that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 is also known as the point of origin 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 in the case of our character his point 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.470
 web pivot right next to the feet 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 it's easy to see go in the select scene tab 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 your character and click directly on the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.750
 menu on this button next to Global is 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.060
 writing center 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 it will change to pivot and you will be able to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.310
 see through the guidismo that these are 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.590
 three arrows pointing xyez axes 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.619
 that the pivot point of the character is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 near his feet and that's where a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.380
 lightning 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.960
 We are going to make a small 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.270
 modification in the code so that the radius 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.790
 exit the center of the character or 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 less than a point near the center 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.470
 if you are still using a capsule 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.750
 Unite you will not find this 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.610
 problem because the pivot point of objects 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.700
 of the river where they are usually in the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.380
 object but in our case the pivot point 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.680
 is near the feet 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.240
 then the ray comes out near the feet but 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.129
 before making the correction we go 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.989
 to draw a ray for a better 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.260
 illustration of what is happening 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.890
 let's go to the code and just below the line 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.220
 detection 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.440
 wall we will create the line that 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.810
 will draw a ray we will write then 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.100
 from point buggy 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:32.580
 I played turn point position which is the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.830
 place of origin of my comma ray 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:44.400
 turn the ford point or to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 front and color collor punto green 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.230
 close parentheses semicolons save the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.630
 archive 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.500
 Let's see on the night of the game and we'll give 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.500
 a look at the scene 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.290
 see only the ray leaves the pivot point of the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.320
 character 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.420
 that is everyone ask now let's modify 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.610
 the wall detection line so that 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.250
 the radius leaves the center or at least 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.920
 a point near the center of the character 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.459
 the modification is basic we just need 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.209
 tell the king cast that his point of 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.130
 source 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.560
 will not be exactly the point transformer 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.480
 position as the point of origin is a 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.970
 vector 3 we will then create a new 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 factor 3 at the point of origin session of the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.400
 hearst new vector 3 and now we 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.510
 we need to enter the three x values 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.940
 yez 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.350
 in the case of the x-axis we do not want 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.239
 no modification 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.620
 so everything we need to do in this 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.489
 point is put turn point 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.820
 position point x transform with letter 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.000
 tiny and ready 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.310
 on the y-axis we are going to make the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.299
 change to go up a little lightning 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.500
 so let's put transform point 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:11.579
 position point and let's add a 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.220
 value here in my case is one more point 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.350
 two to fifa because this is the point value 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.459
 floating and to 8 z 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.780
 Let's put transform point 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.729
 position point z and closes parentheses for 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.930
 illustration effect let's do the same 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.530
 thing in the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.539
 org.br it will draw ohio exactly 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.210
 at the point we send it requires 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.100
 be drawn on this top line 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.100
 so all we have to do is 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.990
 replace the transformer position with the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.949
 factor 3 we just created here 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.280
 on 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.520
 select it the right mouse button 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.000
 Copy selects transform into position 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:58.940
 the dry right-mouse necklace 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.590
 save a file 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:08.580
 we now see the unity runs the game comes 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.759
 in the scene tab and now you can see that the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.110
 ray is being fired from a point 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.160
 much closer to the center of our 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.449
 character 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.280
 So when I move around the 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.190
 ramp 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.650
 the radius does not touch the ramp anymore 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.560
 so it does not detect the ramp as a 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.280
 wall and my character can over 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.490
 ramps normally and our fast 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.550
 correction is made 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.349
 now you can get rid of the line that 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.349
 draw ohio in our scene 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:52.380
 remember to save the file with this 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.770
 we finished part 5 of our 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.820
 basic 3d tutorial of unity 3d 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.820
 Thank you and see you next time 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.529
 ah
