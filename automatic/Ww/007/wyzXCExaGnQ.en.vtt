with<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:29.970> applied<00:00:30.390> colors<00:00:30.779> kit<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.320> your

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
with our applied colors kit this is your

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.670 
with our applied colors kit this is your
repair<00:00:35.040> bridge<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.960> what<00:00:36.960> we'll<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> we're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
repair bridge and what we'll do is we're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
repair bridge and what we'll do is we're
going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> injector<00:00:39.090> directly<00:00:39.629> over

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
going to get the injector directly over

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.319 
going to get the injector directly over
the<00:00:39.989> repair<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> eject<00:00:41.550> injector<00:00:42.180> in

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the repair get the eject injector in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.150 
the repair get the eject injector in
contact<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> glass<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.129> going

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
contact with the glass and we're going

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
contact with the glass and we're going
to<00:00:44.430> drop<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:44.940> resin<00:00:45.360> into<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> injector<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
to drop our resin into the injector and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.190 
to drop our resin into the injector and
insert<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> into<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> repair<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.600> so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
insert it into the repair from there so

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.709 
insert it into the repair from there so
we'll<00:00:49.350> rotate<00:00:49.559> over<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.850> injector<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
we'll rotate over the injector so that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
we'll rotate over the injector so that
it's<00:00:51.870> directly<00:00:52.379> above<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> repair<00:00:53.280> we'll

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's directly above the repair we'll

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
it's directly above the repair we'll
lock<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> place<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> suction<00:00:55.710> cup

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
lock it in place with the suction cup

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.029 
lock it in place with the suction cup
and<00:00:56.420> we'll<00:00:57.420> thread<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> injector<00:00:58.800> until

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and we'll thread down the injector until

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
and we'll thread down the injector until
it<00:00:59.160> contacts<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> class<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:00.690> we'll<00:01:00.840> add

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it contacts the class so now we'll add

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.470 
it contacts the class so now we'll add
eight<00:01:01.230> drops<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.739> applied<00:01:02.039> colors<00:01:02.489> fill<00:01:03.000> resin

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
eight drops of applied colors fill resin

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.149 
eight drops of applied colors fill resin
to<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> injector<00:01:06.439> insert<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> plug<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
to the injector insert the plug and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149 
to the injector insert the plug and
thread<00:01:09.119> downwards<00:01:09.659> until<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.860> come<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
thread downwards until you come in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
thread downwards until you come in
contact<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> resin<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.360> begin<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> push

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
contact with the resin and begin to push

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
contact with the resin and begin to push
the<00:01:13.200> resin<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> repair<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.640> I'll

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the resin into the repair now I'll

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
the resin into the repair now I'll
continue<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.420> thread<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> plug<00:01:16.350> downwards

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
continue to thread the plug downwards

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
continue to thread the plug downwards
until<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.880> resin<00:01:18.270> begins<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.990> fill<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
until the resin begins to fill the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.130 
until the resin begins to fill the
repair<00:01:19.890> I'll<00:01:20.790> reverse<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> plug<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.780> create

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
repair I'll reverse the plug to create

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
repair I'll reverse the plug to create
vacuum<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:23.159> will<00:01:23.369> draw<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.759> excess<00:01:24.210> resin

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
vacuum this will draw out excess resin

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
vacuum this will draw out excess resin
I'll<00:01:25.200> repeat<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> pressure<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> vacuum

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
I'll repeat the pressure and vacuum

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.660 
I'll repeat the pressure and vacuum
cycle<00:01:27.360> twice<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.619> push<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> resin<00:01:29.400> further

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
cycle twice to push the resin further

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.719 
cycle twice to push the resin further
into<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> damaged<00:01:30.570> areas<00:01:31.040> now<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> rotate<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
into the damaged areas now I rotate the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
into the damaged areas now I rotate the
bridge<00:01:32.939> away<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> repair<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> wipe<00:01:34.530> up

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
bridge away from the repair and wipe up

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
bridge away from the repair and wipe up
the<00:01:34.740> excess<00:01:34.890> resin

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the excess resin

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990 
the excess resin
okay<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.260> below<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.710> surfaces<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.610> repair

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
okay so below the surfaces of the repair

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.270 
okay so below the surfaces of the repair
we<00:01:40.210> filled<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.690> cracks<00:01:40.960> at<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.680> top<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.040> still

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
we filled the cracks at the top we still

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.070 
we filled the cracks at the top we still
have<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:42.610> pit<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.090> take<00:01:43.270> care<00:01:43.510> of<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:43.930> we'll

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
have this pit to take care of so we'll

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.200 
have this pit to take care of so we'll
apply<00:01:44.170> two<00:01:44.350> drops<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:45.100> applied<00:01:45.550> College<00:01:45.940> Pit

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210
