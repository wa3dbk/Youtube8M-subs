trying to get the perfect angle and so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.130 
trying to get the perfect angle and so
we<00:00:26.310> developed<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.820> camera<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.539> allows<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.080> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
interesting project for him and us in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.530 
interesting project for him and us in
the<00:02:01.290> sense<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.969> 360-degree<00:02:02.969> cameras<00:02:03.360> done

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the sense that 360-degree cameras done

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.600 
the sense that 360-degree cameras done
exists<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.860> ran<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> lot<00:02:05.579> of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
exists so we ran into a lot of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 
exists so we ran into a lot of
challenges<00:02:06.000> from<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.930> usability<00:02:07.380> perspective

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
challenges from a usability perspective

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830 
challenges from a usability perspective
we<00:02:08.489> had<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.759> come<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.179> creative<00:02:09.420> ways

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we had to come up with creative ways

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.120 
we had to come up with creative ways
that<00:02:09.869> allowed<00:02:10.290> people<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.649> hold<00:02:10.829> the<00:02:11.009> device

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
that allowed people to hold the device

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.280 
that allowed people to hold the device
without<00:02:12.060> blocking<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.840> cameras<00:02:13.170> with

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
without blocking one of my cameras with

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
without blocking one of my cameras with
their<00:02:13.440> hands<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.640> was<00:02:14.819> why<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:14.970> ended<00:02:15.270> up

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
their hands so that was why we ended up

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.110 
their hands so that was why we ended up
with

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
with

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.760

a<00:02:22.190> lot<00:02:22.370> about<00:02:22.430> was<00:02:22.880> creating<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.330> device<00:02:23.630> that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
a lot about was creating a device that
