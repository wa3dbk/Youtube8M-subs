 of ten games without a win they are the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.449
 Rennes gets a huge opportunity 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.120

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.949
 for the Guingampais 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.360
 since sylvain armand stand in for 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.610
 Benoît Costil 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.699
 the ball is still in play the keystroke 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:00.220

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.790
 the ball goes back into the feet of 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.560
 claudio beauvue who think open the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.719
 mark but no since he finds a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.619
 again on the trajectory ahead 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.100
 his goal line 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.759
 sylvain armand in the space of a few 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.890
 minutes 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.659
 the former defender Nantes was shown 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.200
 decisive their tour of alioui l ue 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.119
 get the ball back 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.159
 a situation where the Rennes have trouble 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.170
 to come off and these are the dialogues in 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.880
 peace who will enjoy it at the 39th 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.700
 minute thanks to this thibault goal 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 giresse the third achievement of the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.439
 season for the son of dj 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 the Guingampais had no longer scored in 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.570
 first period since September 25 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.299
 and this strike of the pure left of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.119
 thibault giresse comes to validate the very 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.119
 good half hour of guingampais 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.890
 in this first period the Rennes 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.960
 had been enterprising in the first 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.490
 quarter of an hour but then left 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.770
 game control to jocelyn's men 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.119
 Gourvennec 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.580
 in the second period we find a 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.700
 again is only a peace glove with 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.580
 this shot of yatabaré and who is boxed 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.470
 at the first post by benoît costil a 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.879
 once again the guingampais at the front 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.130
 posts with benoît costil who is 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.070
 much less inspired 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.370
 and who mows to feel us and sir 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.290
 castro releases yellow card for benoît 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.290
 costil and refers to the penalty point 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.250
 yatabaré face costil the opposite-foot and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.410
 successful for the scorer of the forward 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.660
 guingamp eighth goal of the season his 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.550
 first outside his second 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.490
 penalty scored on four attempts 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.960
 guingamp is needed 2 to 0 yet very 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.250
 good to nantes last week queen 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.500
 do not link and confirm his 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.480
 inconstances the guingampais them ali a 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.470
 second consecutive win and replay 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.470
