00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
things so right here this plug needs to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
things so right here this plug needs to
be<00:00:46.410> disconnected<00:00:46.920> there's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> little<00:00:47.670> lever

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
be disconnected there's a little lever

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.139 
be disconnected there's a little lever
right<00:00:48.750> where<00:00:49.079> my<00:00:49.230> finger<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.800> pushing<00:00:50.370> where

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
right where my finger is pushing where

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
right where my finger is pushing where
you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.480> push<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.530> unlatch<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.039> then

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you can push it in an unlatch and then

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
you can push it in an unlatch and then
that<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.820> plug<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.390> slide<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:54.780> so

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that this plug will slide right off so

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.819 
that this plug will slide right off so
you<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.890> connect<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.480> then<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.829> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you just connect that then you have this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
you just connect that then you have this
little<00:00:59.010> coupler<00:00:59.550> holder<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:01.020> pop<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
little coupler holder thing you pop this

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.579 
little coupler holder thing you pop this
breather<00:01:02.070> tube<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.930> goes<00:01:04.140> right

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
breather tube it was just goes right

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
breather tube it was just goes right
there<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.010> dead<00:01:05.129> ends<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.939> pop<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.180> and

here's the actual actually here's the
old<00:01:56.070> fuel<00:01:56.969> filter<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:59.630> there<00:02:00.630> are<00:02:01.850> two<00:02:02.850> little

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
old fuel filter and there are two little

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.130 
old fuel filter and there are two little
screws<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.659> hold<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:05.450> assembly<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
screws that hold this assembly that is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.680 
screws that hold this assembly that is
currently<00:02:07.979> installed<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> van<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
currently installed on the van but you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.600 
currently installed on the van but you
will<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:11.129> you're<00:02:11.250> doing<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
will have it here when you're doing it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.309 
will have it here when you're doing it
too<00:02:12.270> little

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
too little

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.610 
too little
works<00:02:13.439> screws<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.239> will<00:02:15.689> take<00:02:16.140> out<00:02:16.379> and

works screws that you will take out and
then<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:17.609> piece<00:02:18.269> rotates<00:02:19.069> clockwise<00:02:20.069> one

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
then that piece rotates clockwise one

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.000 
then that piece rotates clockwise one
little<00:02:21.209> click<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.629> then<00:02:22.139> you<00:02:22.230> pull<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.799> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
little click and then you pull it out of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
little click and then you pull it out of
the<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:23.969> and<00:02:24.209> it's<00:02:24.389> got<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.569> couple<00:02:24.689> own<00:02:24.989> rings

that<00:02:25.409> seal<00:02:25.620> down<00:02:26.310> inside<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.969> there<00:02:27.719> and<00:02:28.790> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that seal down inside of there and so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.459 
that seal down inside of there and so
you<00:02:29.849> slide<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.389> and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:31.049> slide<00:02:31.349> it

you take out with a little Torx and then
you<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.329> rotate<00:03:06.719> this<00:03:06.959> plastic<00:03:07.709> assembly

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
you just rotate this plastic assembly

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.629 
you just rotate this plastic assembly
this<00:03:09.349> electro<00:03:10.349> electric<00:03:10.919> connector<00:03:11.430> is

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
this electro electric connector is

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.399 
this electro electric connector is
connected<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.359> this<00:03:12.480> plastic<00:03:13.049> sembly

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
connected on to this plastic sembly

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.369 
connected on to this plastic sembly
rotate<00:03:14.099> this<00:03:14.280> clockwise<00:03:14.639> just<00:03:15.629> like<00:03:15.810> i<00:03:16.169> don't

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
rotate this clockwise just like i don't

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.990 
rotate this clockwise just like i don't
know<00:03:16.560> ii<00:03:16.799> 'the<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.219> a<00:03:17.280> turn<00:03:17.489> or<00:03:17.609> whatever<00:03:17.819> that

is so that you can pull this out of the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.569 
is so that you can pull this out of the
center<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.269> fuel<00:03:21.840> filter<00:03:22.229> so<00:03:22.949> just<00:03:23.489> to

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
center of that fuel filter so just to

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.069 
center of that fuel filter so just to
show<00:03:23.729> you<00:03:23.790> again<00:03:23.939> where<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.419> location<00:03:24.930> of

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
this fuel or fuel filter is right you

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.849 
this fuel or fuel filter is right you
can<00:03:30.599> see<00:03:30.780> where<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.049> are<00:03:31.079> here<00:03:31.439> on<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> front

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
can see where we are here on the front

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.409 
can see where we are here on the front
left<00:03:32.159> of<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> vehicle<00:03:32.819> if<00:03:32.939> you<00:03:33.030> were<00:03:33.120> sitting

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
left of the vehicle if you were sitting

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.009 
left of the vehicle if you were sitting
in<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.659> and<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:34.709> go<00:03:35.009> in<00:03:35.250> here<00:03:35.810> right<00:03:36.810> down

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
in it and you just go in here right down

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
in it and you just go in here right down
past<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:40.189> right<00:03:41.189> down<00:03:41.340> there<00:03:41.639> you<00:03:41.729> can<00:03:41.879> see

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
past and right down there you can see

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.599 
past and right down there you can see
you've<00:03:42.720> got<00:03:42.750> your<00:03:43.199> dual<00:03:43.650> filter<00:03:44.009> so<00:03:44.340> again

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
you've got your dual filter so again

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.849 
you've got your dual filter so again
place<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.239> once<00:03:45.509> every<00:03:45.780> ten<00:03:46.349> thousand<00:03:46.709> miles

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
place it once every ten thousand miles

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.309 
place it once every ten thousand miles
or<00:03:47.159> so<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:48.000> basically<00:03:48.449> once<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.900> every<00:03:49.109> oil

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
or so it's basically once that every oil

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.710 
or so it's basically once that every oil
change<00:03:49.709> interval<00:03:50.129> since<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.669> Dodge<00:03:51.449> Sprinter

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
change interval since the Dodge Sprinter
