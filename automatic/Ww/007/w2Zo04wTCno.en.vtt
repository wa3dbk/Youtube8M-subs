00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
ones I've used are pictured here and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.370 
ones I've used are pictured here and
will<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.679> listed<00:00:11.130> below<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:12.660> I've<00:00:12.809> started<00:00:13.110> out

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
will be listed below so I've started out

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530 
will be listed below so I've started out
with<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.710> dark<00:00:14.009> blue<00:00:14.340> base<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.299> hollow

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
with this dark blue base it's a hollow

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.980 
with this dark blue base it's a hollow
polish<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.830> hollow<00:00:17.600> really<00:00:18.600> makes<00:00:18.810> it

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
polish and that hollow really makes it

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.750 
polish and that hollow really makes it
look<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.350> starry<00:00:19.890> night<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> thought<00:00:20.670> it

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
look like a starry night so I thought it

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.779 
look like a starry night so I thought it
was<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> perfect<00:00:21.240> base<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.170> design<00:00:22.789> I'm

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
was the perfect base for this design I'm

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.880 
was the perfect base for this design I'm
using<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.269> silver<00:00:24.480> polish<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.109> create<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.650> base

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
using a silver polish to create the base

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.310 
using a silver polish to create the base
for<00:00:26.310> my<00:00:26.510> buildings<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.810> reason<00:00:28.080> I've<00:00:28.199> gone

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
for my buildings the reason I've gone

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.810 
for my buildings the reason I've gone
with<00:00:28.529> silver<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> create<00:00:29.640> our

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
with silver this is going to create our

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.720 
with silver this is going to create our
windows<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:31.560> chosen<00:00:31.830> silver<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
windows and I've chosen silver because I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
windows and I've chosen silver because I
wanted<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.780> more<00:00:33.930> subtle

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
wanted it to be a little bit more subtle

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.100 
wanted it to be a little bit more subtle
a<00:00:34.500> gold<00:00:35.190> would<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.579> great<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> bright<00:00:36.899> yellow

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
a gold would be great or a bright yellow

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.709 
a gold would be great or a bright yellow
as<00:00:37.500> well<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:38.940> wear<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.300> designed

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
as well I was gonna wear this designed

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.420 
as well I was gonna wear this designed
to<00:00:39.840> work<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> few<00:00:40.379> days<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.980> didn't<00:00:41.280> want

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
to work for a few days I didn't want

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910 
to work for a few days I didn't want
anything<00:00:41.640> too<00:00:42.000> loud<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.480> over-the-top<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
anything too loud or over-the-top so I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.709 
anything too loud or over-the-top so I
went<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.489> silver<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
went with this silver I also think the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.170 
went with this silver I also think the
silver<00:00:46.050> looks<00:00:46.289> great<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.700> background

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
silver looks great with the background

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600 
silver looks great with the background
here<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.200> matched<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.710> dress<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.370> my

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here and it matched my dress and my

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.069 
here and it matched my dress and my
jewelry<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.329> wearing<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> New

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
jewelry that I was wearing to the New

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
jewelry that I was wearing to the New
York<00:00:52.320> themed<00:00:52.620> event<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
York themed event I was going to so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
York themed event I was going to so
another<00:00:54.809> reason<00:00:55.020> why<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> went<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
another reason why I went with the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.369 
another reason why I went with the
silver<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> blue<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.289> going

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
silver and the blue so then we're going

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
silver and the blue so then we're going
to<00:00:58.469> outline<00:00:58.829> each<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.190> our<00:00:59.309> silver<00:00:59.820> shapes<00:01:00.120> I'm

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to outline each of our silver shapes I'm

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.290 
to outline each of our silver shapes I'm
just<00:01:01.079> using<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.440> thinner<00:01:02.160> brush<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.000> black

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
just using my thinner brush and my black

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.840 
just using my thinner brush and my black
polish<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.500> create<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.159> step

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.100 

so<00:01:08.850> once<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.210> done<00:01:09.240> outlining<00:01:09.810> we're<00:01:10.020> now

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so once you're done outlining we're now

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
so once you're done outlining we're now
gonna<00:01:10.289> create<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.829> windows<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.729> I'm<00:01:11.820> gonna<00:01:11.909> do

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
gonna create the windows so I'm gonna do

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
gonna create the windows so I'm gonna do
horizontal<00:01:12.899> lines<00:01:13.140> I'm<00:01:13.439> trying<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> space

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
horizontal lines I'm trying to space

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
horizontal lines I'm trying to space
them<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.579> evenly<00:01:14.969> as<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.890> once<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
them as evenly as I can and then once I

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
them as evenly as I can and then once I
add<00:01:17.520> these<00:01:17.700> horizontal<00:01:18.090> lines<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:19.320> gonna

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
add these horizontal lines we're gonna

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.169 
add these horizontal lines we're gonna
create<00:01:19.740> another<00:01:19.799> vertical<00:01:20.340> line<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
create another vertical line down the

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.919 
create another vertical line down the
center<00:01:22.880> try<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> keep<00:01:24.149> your<00:01:24.270> line<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.630> straight

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
center try to keep your line as straight

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.809 
center try to keep your line as straight
as<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.079> can<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.560> remember<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:26.549> viewing

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
as you can but remember you're viewing

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.730 
as you can but remember you're viewing
this<00:01:27.060> probably<00:01:27.539> on<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> much<00:01:28.020> larger<00:01:28.259> screen

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this probably on a much larger screen

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.850 
this probably on a much larger screen
and<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.509> actual<00:01:31.110> nail<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and when it's on your actual nail you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.899 
and when it's on your actual nail you
don't<00:01:32.069> really<00:01:32.340> notice<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.789> little

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
don't really notice the little

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
don't really notice the little
imperfections<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.439> also<00:01:34.649> had<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
imperfections like that I also had a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
imperfections like that I also had a
little<00:01:35.189> antenna<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> top<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
little antenna to the top of that

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.419 
little antenna to the top of that
building<00:01:37.319> just<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.799> give<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.069> little<00:01:38.250> bit

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
building just to give it a little bit

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.719 
building just to give it a little bit
more<00:01:38.640> umph<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.869> design<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.399> gonna<00:01:41.549> do

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
more umph to the design so I'm gonna do

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.399 
more umph to the design so I'm gonna do
the<00:01:41.849> same<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.599> the<00:01:42.959> next<00:01:43.369> building

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
the same thing on the next building

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.330 
the same thing on the next building
basically<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.560> creating<00:01:47.220> those

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
basically I'm just creating those

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.300 
basically I'm just creating those
horizontal<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.149> vertical<00:01:48.599> lines<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
horizontal and vertical lines and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.499 
horizontal and vertical lines and
creating<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.429> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> windowed<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.299> now

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
creating this kind of windowed look now

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.660 
creating this kind of windowed look now
I<00:01:51.810> wanted<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> add<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.799> bit<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.099> black<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
I wanted to add a little bit of black to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.350 
I wanted to add a little bit of black to
the<00:01:53.819> tip<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:54.869> nail<00:01:55.080> as<00:01:55.439> well<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.179> also

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the tip of my nail as well and I also

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
the tip of my nail as well and I also
wanted<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> add<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.080> couple<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:59.220> plain

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
wanted to add a couple of just plain

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
wanted to add a couple of just plain
black<00:01:59.759> buildings<00:02:00.209> without<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.689> windows<00:02:01.020> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
black buildings without the windows so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440 
black buildings without the windows so
it's<00:02:01.649> basically<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.459> same<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> initial

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it's basically the same as that initial

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
it's basically the same as that initial
step<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> silver<00:02:04.679> but<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.459> not<00:02:05.610> going

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
step with the silver but I'm not going

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.270 
step with the silver but I'm not going
to<00:02:05.819> create<00:02:06.060> any<00:02:06.299> windows<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.959> this<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
to create any windows on this one and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880 
to create any windows on this one and
that's<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.360> design<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:09.959> basic<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.679> did

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that's it this design is so basic I did

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.319 
that's it this design is so basic I did
want<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.489> add<00:02:11.609> some<00:02:11.640> stars<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
want to go in and add some stars and

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.900 
want to go in and add some stars and
fireworks<00:02:13.019> but<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.220> end<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.519> didn't<00:02:14.790> have

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
fireworks but in the end I didn't have

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.520 
fireworks but in the end I didn't have
time<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> night<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.019> event<00:02:16.109> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
time to do it the night of the event and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.870 
time to do it the night of the event and
I<00:02:16.620> didn't<00:02:16.920> want<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.130> wear<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.700> to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
I didn't want to wear it like that to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.740 
I didn't want to wear it like that to
work<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.239> week<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.140> skipped<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.069> step<00:02:20.130> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
work all week so I skipped that step and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.090 
work all week so I skipped that step and
just<00:02:21.750> remember<00:02:22.140> change<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> buildings

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
just remember change up the buildings

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.680 
just remember change up the buildings
they<00:02:23.280> don't<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:23.639> have<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> same<00:02:24.420> I

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
