whole lot of other people wild scenic

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.569 
whole lot of other people wild scenic
might<00:04:11.930> not<00:04:12.079> be<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.319> only<00:04:12.350> tool<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.010> protect

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
might not be the only tool to protect

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.099 
might not be the only tool to protect
the<00:04:13.790> Yampa<00:04:14.150> there<00:04:14.690> could<00:04:14.840> be<00:04:14.870> other

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
the Yampa there could be other

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.719 
the Yampa there could be other
mechanisms<00:04:15.739> including<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.280> state<00:04:16.549> in

mechanisms including a state in

mechanisms including a state in
streamflow<00:04:17.239> water<00:04:17.479> right<00:04:17.979> but<00:04:18.979> in<00:04:19.070> my<00:04:19.100> opinion

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
streamflow water right but in my opinion

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.979 
streamflow water right but in my opinion
if<00:04:19.760> you're<00:04:19.880> going<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.120> protect<00:04:20.479> it<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.780> need

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
if you're going to protect it you need

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.379 
if you're going to protect it you need
some<00:04:21.289> sort<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.590> water<00:04:21.829> right<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.729> have<00:04:23.150> that

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
some sort of water right to have that

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.170 
some sort of water right to have that
permanency<00:04:24.080> of<00:04:24.110> protection<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:26.030> have

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
permanency of protection to to have

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.279 
permanency of protection to to have
something<00:04:26.419> on<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.750> ground<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.080> may

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
something on the ground that may

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.800 
something on the ground that may
maintain<00:04:27.680> some<00:04:28.310> space<00:04:28.910> level<00:04:29.150> of<00:04:29.360> flows<00:04:29.600> in

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
maintain some space level of flows in

00:04:29.810 --> 00:05:47.420 
maintain some space level of flows in
the<00:04:29.900> Yampa

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.460 

Oh
