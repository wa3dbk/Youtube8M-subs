00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.410 
this is the flywheel puller from Harbor
Freight<00:00:04.220> added<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.370> hook<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:06.440> these<00:00:07.440> screws

Freight added this hook and these screws
bolts<00:00:10.519> this<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.670> how<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.880> sits<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.269> there<00:00:12.480> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
bolts this is how it sits on there you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.460 
bolts this is how it sits on there you
just<00:00:12.750> thread<00:00:13.110> these<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:15.260> they're<00:00:16.260> fine

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
just thread these in and they're fine

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.529 
just thread these in and they're fine
thread<00:00:16.859> bolts<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.580> they're<00:00:17.670> 5/16<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
thread bolts I think they're 5/16 so

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.420 
thread bolts I think they're 5/16 so
I'll<00:00:18.630> check<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:18.990> that

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.040 

get<00:00:23.430> them<00:00:23.519> all<00:00:23.730> pretty<00:00:24.330> much<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> same

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
get them all pretty much in the same

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.179 
get them all pretty much in the same
depth<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.830> pulls<00:00:26.640> level<00:00:27.800> that's<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:31.189> this

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
depth so it pulls level that's it this

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.850 
depth so it pulls level that's it this
is<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.460> setup<00:00:32.989> hung<00:00:33.989> between<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:34.739> by

is my setup hung between two two by
fours<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.239> plenty<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> strength<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.489> uh

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
fours and it's plenty of strength to uh

fours and it's plenty of strength to uh
this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.930> 300<00:00:40.590> pounds<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.489> more

close though if I rotate this up oh yeah
hmm<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> two-person<00:01:27.659> job

hanging<00:01:59.210> pallets<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.330> wheels<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.750> handy<00:02:05.690> you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
hanging pallets on wheels are handy you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.630 
hanging pallets on wheels are handy you
see<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.050> scag<00:02:07.620> already<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.070> hammered<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
see this scag already got hammered and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.180 
see this scag already got hammered and
bent<00:02:08.970> once<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.820> boat<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.150> gonna<00:02:12.240> sell<00:02:13.190> so

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
bent once the boat I'm gonna sell so

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.830 
bent once the boat I'm gonna sell so
that's<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.400> whole<00:02:14.520> nother<00:02:14.640> project<00:02:15.210> doing<00:02:15.690> this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that's a whole nother project doing this

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.800 
that's a whole nother project doing this
second<00:02:16.470> after<00:02:16.820> fix-up<00:02:18.140> boat<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.260> keeping

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
second after fix-up boat I'm keeping

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.070 
second after fix-up boat I'm keeping
obviously

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.200 

let's<00:02:27.710> winter<00:02:28.070> time<00:02:28.280> by<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.520> way<00:02:28.670> too<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
let's winter time by the way too so I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.200 
let's winter time by the way too so I
can<00:02:29.450> only<00:02:29.540> sell<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.870> as<00:02:30.110> why<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.970> you're<00:02:32.150> all

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
can only sell it as why so you're all

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.320 
can only sell it as why so you're all
wait<00:02:32.330> till<00:02:32.480> spring<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:34.610> summer<00:02:34.910> maybe<00:02:35.150> I'd

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
wait till spring this summer maybe I'd

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.890 
wait till spring this summer maybe I'd
be<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.660> bigger<00:02:35.840> hurry<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.200> don't<00:02:36.560> know<00:02:37.900> these

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
be in a bigger hurry I don't know these

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.210 
be in a bigger hurry I don't know these
are<00:02:38.960> a<00:02:39.080> pain<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.440> ass<00:02:39.590> by<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.800> way<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:39.980> use

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
are a pain in the ass by the way I use

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.640 
are a pain in the ass by the way I use
an<00:02:40.370> engine<00:02:40.520> hoist<00:02:40.880> if<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.300> could<00:02:41.540> because<00:02:41.960> you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
an engine hoist if I could because you

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.160 
an engine hoist if I could because you
can't<00:02:42.920> move<00:02:43.160> it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
can't move it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.350 
can't move it
just<00:02:45.170> by<00:02:45.320> yourself<00:02:45.410> very<00:02:45.920> well<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.730> it's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
just by yourself very well so it's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.490 
just by yourself very well so it's
actually<00:02:47.480> easier<00:02:47.810> for<00:02:47.930> me<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.260> move<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.100> boat

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
actually easier for me to move the boat

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:01.390 
actually easier for me to move the boat
should<00:02:51.500> easier<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:52.280> not<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.580> easy<00:03:00.400> all

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
should easier but not that easy all

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.790 
should easier but not that easy all
right<00:03:01.460> so<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:01.850> lined<00:03:02.060> up<00:03:02.270> on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.800> second

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
right so it's lined up on the second

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.680 
right so it's lined up on the second
hole<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.400> here<00:03:04.580> now<00:03:04.760> now<00:03:05.450> I'm<00:03:05.570> just

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
hole you can see here now now I'm just

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.870 
hole you can see here now now I'm just
looking<00:03:05.990> at<00:03:06.110> this<00:03:06.200> cavitation<00:03:06.890> plate<00:03:06.920> it's<00:03:07.730> a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
looking at this cavitation plate it's a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.660 
looking at this cavitation plate it's a
little<00:03:08.150> higher<00:03:08.980> than<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> bottom<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.550> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
little higher than the bottom of the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.890 
little higher than the bottom of the
boat<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.960> might<00:03:12.170> be<00:03:12.200> fine<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:13.720> that's<00:03:14.720> a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
boat and that might be fine but that's a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.290 
boat and that might be fine but that's a
little<00:03:14.990> more<00:03:15.200> efficient<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:16.340> think<00:03:17.180> it's

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
little more efficient but I think it's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.190 
little more efficient but I think it's
going<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> cavitate<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.080> bit<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:18.890> just<00:03:19.070> be<00:03:19.220> sure

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
going to cavitate a bit so just be sure

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.330 
going to cavitate a bit so just be sure
thinking<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.260> might<00:03:21.380> lower<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.800> down<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
thinking I might lower it down to the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.870 
thinking I might lower it down to the
lowest<00:03:22.580> hole<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:24.560> motor<00:03:25.070> this<00:03:25.310> came<00:03:25.550> off<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
lowest hole this motor this came off the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.160 
lowest hole this motor this came off the
dream<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.240> was<00:03:26.270> in<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.570> second<00:03:26.870> hole<00:03:27.020> it

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
dream I was in the second hole it

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.300 
dream I was in the second hole it
totally<00:03:28.570> would<00:03:29.570> cavitating<00:03:30.440> turns<00:03:30.770> tight

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
totally would cavitating turns tight

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.150 
totally would cavitating turns tight
turns<00:03:31.550> should<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.030> don't<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.130> a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
turns should I don't like this is a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.240 
turns should I don't like this is a

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
Panther power trim unit it makes my lot

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.180 
Panther power trim unit it makes my lot
my<00:03:37.550> so<00:03:37.910> much<00:03:38.030> easier<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:39.650> replace<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.070> motor

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
my so much easier to replace the motor

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.640 
my so much easier to replace the motor
on<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.820> take<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.090> off<00:03:41.209> too<00:03:41.390> because<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
on this and take it off too because I

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.830 
on this and take it off too because I
don't<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.700> worry<00:03:43.910> about<00:03:44.030> any<00:03:44.270> through

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
don't have to worry about any through

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.080 
don't have to worry about any through
Hall<00:03:45.080> bolts<00:03:45.680> being<00:03:45.890> sealed<00:03:46.250> like<00:03:46.670> these<00:03:46.940> are

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
Hall bolts being sealed like these are

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390 
Hall bolts being sealed like these are
all<00:03:47.209> sealed<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.630> can<00:03:47.750> leave<00:03:47.900> them<00:03:48.020> alone<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.470> I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
all sealed I can leave them alone and I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.960 
all sealed I can leave them alone and I
can<00:03:49.550> just<00:03:49.670> kind<00:03:50.330> of<00:03:50.360> bolt<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:52.610> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
can just kind of bolt it on the the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.580 
can just kind of bolt it on the the
reason<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.239> have<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:53.810> because<00:03:54.140> when<00:03:54.560> I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
reason I have this is because when I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.170 
reason I have this is because when I
bought<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.920> boat<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:55.220> came<00:03:55.400> with<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.670> zookie

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
bought the boat it came with the zookie

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.410 
bought the boat it came with the zookie
65<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.830> power<00:03:58.459> trim<00:03:58.670> was<00:03:58.820> dead<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.300> the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
65 that the power trim was dead so the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.360 
65 that the power trim was dead so the
guys<00:03:59.600> that<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.959> replacing<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:00.830> power<00:04:01.010> trim<00:04:01.250> on

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
guys that a replacing the power trim on

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.550 
guys that a replacing the power trim on
the<00:04:01.459> motor<00:04:01.670> he<00:04:02.540> got<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.690> whole<00:04:02.870> new<00:04:02.959> power<00:04:03.230> trim

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
the motor he got a whole new power trim

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.500 
the motor he got a whole new power trim
unit<00:04:03.890> which<00:04:04.580> was<00:04:04.670> cheaper<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.090> guess<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.480> that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
unit which was cheaper I guess and that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.530 
unit which was cheaper I guess and that
also<00:04:05.690> brings<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.290> back<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:07.070> 9<00:04:08.000> inches<00:04:08.330> which

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
also brings it back like 9 inches which

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.830 
also brings it back like 9 inches which
kind<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.840> lets<00:04:09.080> you<00:04:09.230> set<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:09.650> higher<00:04:10.840> they

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
kind of lets you set this higher they

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.690 
kind of lets you set this higher they
say<00:04:12.050> for<00:04:12.290> every<00:04:12.440> foot<00:04:12.650> back<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.160> set<00:04:13.370> up<00:04:13.400> 1

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
say for every foot back you can set up 1

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.180 
say for every foot back you can set up 1
inch<00:04:13.910> will<00:04:14.360> give<00:04:15.050> you<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.170> better<00:04:15.350> draft<00:04:15.650> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
inch will give you a better draft and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.070 
inch will give you a better draft and
also<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.180> little<00:04:17.270> more<00:04:17.450> performance<00:04:17.930> because

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
also a little more performance because

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.570 
also a little more performance because
there's<00:04:18.230> less<00:04:18.350> drag<00:04:18.680> down<00:04:18.919> here<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.280> blow<00:04:19.459> the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
there's less drag down here and blow the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.190 
there's less drag down here and blow the
water<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.380> all<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:22.040> got<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:23.050> shove<00:04:24.050> these

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
water so all I got to do is shove these

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.960 
water so all I got to do is shove these
bolts<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:24.710> here<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:26.270> then<00:04:26.540> she's<00:04:27.260> hung<00:04:27.970> just

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
bolts in here and then she's hung just

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.600 
bolts in here and then she's hung just
occurred<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.390> me<00:04:29.510> why<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.870> was<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.080> easy

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
occurred to me why that was so easy

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.310 
occurred to me why that was so easy
because<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.820> didn't<00:04:32.090> mess<00:04:32.840> with<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.110> steering

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
because I didn't mess with the steering

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.670 
because I didn't mess with the steering
cable<00:04:33.560> which<00:04:33.800> is<00:04:33.919> usually<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.370> biggest<00:04:35.680> pain

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
cable which is usually the biggest pain

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.749 
cable which is usually the biggest pain
mass<00:04:38.650> so

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
mass so

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.809 
mass so
I<00:04:40.789> already<00:04:41.449> kind<00:04:41.719> of<00:04:41.750> did<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.340> then<00:04:43.340> forgot<00:04:43.699> to

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
I already kind of did it then forgot to

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.279 
I already kind of did it then forgot to
show<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.330> night<00:04:44.509> kind<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.870> undid<00:04:45.259> it

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
show you the night kind of undid it

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.010 
show you the night kind of undid it
halfway<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.159> so<00:04:47.259> I'll<00:04:48.259> show<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:49.719> before<00:04:50.719> you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
halfway and so I'll show you before you

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.580 
halfway and so I'll show you before you
put<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:53.060> back<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.389> there<00:04:53.750> grease<00:04:54.199> it<00:04:54.349> with<00:04:54.379> some

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
put it back in there grease it with some

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.920 
put it back in there grease it with some
good<00:04:54.740> marine<00:04:55.129> grease<00:04:55.400> all<00:04:56.000> over<00:04:56.060> there<00:04:56.750> that's

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
good marine grease all over there that's

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.679 
good marine grease all over there that's
what<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.229> is<00:04:58.389> and<00:04:59.439> then<00:05:00.439> you<00:05:01.479> shove<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.569> in

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
what that is and then you shove it in

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.540 
what that is and then you shove it in
the<00:05:02.840> hole<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.550> that<00:05:04.629> looks<00:05:05.629> really<00:05:05.840> easy<00:05:05.870> but

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the hole and that looks really easy but

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.600 
the hole and that looks really easy but
depending<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.639> how<00:05:07.849> your<00:05:08.979> boat<00:05:09.979> is<00:05:10.189> set<00:05:10.460> up

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
depending on how your boat is set up

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.080 
depending on how your boat is set up
this<00:05:11.419> Bend<00:05:12.069> may<00:05:13.069> be<00:05:13.129> really<00:05:13.490> sharp<00:05:13.789> it<00:05:13.969> might

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
this Bend may be really sharp it might

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.369 
this Bend may be really sharp it might
be<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.240> pain<00:05:14.509> in<00:05:14.569> the<00:05:14.659> ass<00:05:14.779> you<00:05:14.810> might<00:05:15.169> actually

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
be a pain in the ass you might actually

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.679 
be a pain in the ass you might actually
have<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.620> do<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:15.889> why<00:05:16.669> it's<00:05:16.819> lift<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.210> off<00:05:17.680> so

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
have to do it why it's lift it off so

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.649 
have to do it why it's lift it off so
prepare<00:05:20.689> for<00:05:20.719> that<00:05:21.050> before<00:05:21.439> you<00:05:21.500> bolt<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:21.860> on

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
prepare for that before you bolt this on

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:28.379 
prepare for that before you bolt this on
then<00:05:23.659> you<00:05:23.750> take<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:23.960> big<00:05:24.830> old<00:05:26.379> wrench<00:05:27.379> and<00:05:27.770> you

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
then you take a big old wrench and you

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.969 
then you take a big old wrench and you
make<00:05:29.389> sure<00:05:29.599> this<00:05:29.719> is<00:05:29.870> not<00:05:30.020> cross<00:05:30.349> threaded<00:05:30.590> and

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
make sure this is not cross threaded and

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.420 
make sure this is not cross threaded and
you<00:05:32.500> tighten<00:05:33.500> this<00:05:33.650> down<00:05:33.710> with<00:05:34.099> some<00:05:34.129> good

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
you tighten this down with some good

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.570 
you tighten this down with some good
anti<00:05:34.849> seize<00:05:35.150> and<00:05:36.159> then<00:05:37.159> you're<00:05:37.310> pretty<00:05:37.430> much

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
anti seize and then you're pretty much
