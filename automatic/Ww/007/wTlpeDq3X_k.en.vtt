00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
minute but to transform him basically

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.310 
minute but to transform him basically
you<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> tank<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> bottom<00:00:31.140> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
then for the arms this is kind of cool

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270 
then for the arms this is kind of cool
you<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.329> take<00:01:42.570> them<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.740> open<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
swings around like this and then pegs on

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.940 
swings around like this and then pegs on
to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> under<00:01:53.159> arm<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:54.590> share<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> others

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to the under arm here share the others

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
to the under arm here share the others
other<00:01:56.250> side<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> miss<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
other side I miss that a little bit and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.710 
other side I miss that a little bit and
this<00:01:58.380> panel<00:01:58.710> flips<00:01:59.670> up<00:02:00.290> sticks<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.469> there

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
this panel flips up sticks right there

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.290 
this panel flips up sticks right there
and<00:02:02.840> then<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:04.010> whole<00:02:04.340> arm<00:02:04.640> assembly<00:02:05.120> comes

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
and then this whole arm assembly comes
