00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.290 
when you have little hidden elements so
when<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.960> do<00:03:54.080> two<00:03:54.530> pieces<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:54.980> seem<00:03:55.970> as<00:03:56.120> though

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
when I do two pieces that seem as though

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.360 
when I do two pieces that seem as though
they're<00:03:56.690> very<00:03:56.900> straightforward<00:03:57.200> I'm<00:03:58.130> a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
they're very straightforward I'm a

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.100 
they're very straightforward I'm a
little<00:03:58.580> bit<00:03:58.700> classic<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.330> simple<00:03:59.510> there's

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
little bit classic and simple there's

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.320 
little bit classic and simple there's
always<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.560> little<00:04:00.860> bit<00:04:01.100> hidden<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:01.970> there<00:04:02.150> and

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
always a little bit hidden in there and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.240 
always a little bit hidden in there and
I<00:04:02.420> think<00:04:02.480> that's<00:04:02.990> going<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.410> continue<00:04:03.590> on<00:04:04.100> in

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
I think that's going to continue on in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.580 
I think that's going to continue on in
the<00:04:04.340> future<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.700> think<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:05.330> lot<00:04:05.990> of<00:04:06.020> artists<00:04:06.530> are

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
the future I think a lot of artists are

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.199 
the future I think a lot of artists are
kind<00:04:06.740> of<00:04:06.860> going<00:04:07.070> back<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.490> their<00:04:07.640> roots<00:04:07.880> and

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
kind of going back to their roots and

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.730 
kind of going back to their roots and
saying<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.600> know<00:04:08.720> let<00:04:08.959> me<00:04:08.990> just<00:04:09.110> tweak<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:09.680> a

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
saying you know let me just tweak this a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.820 
saying you know let me just tweak this a
little<00:04:09.860> bit<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.400> make<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.000> new<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.330> different

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
little bit and make it new and different

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.270 
little bit and make it new and different
not<00:04:12.830> only<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.250> public<00:04:13.370> but<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.820> ourselves
