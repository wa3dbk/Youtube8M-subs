want<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.269> you've<00:00:24.420> chosen<00:00:24.720> 32<00:00:25.260> inches<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
want to do is you've chosen 32 inches I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.070 
want to do is you've chosen 32 inches I
want<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> mock<00:00:26.220> 32<00:00:27.029> inches<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> height<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
want to mock 32 inches for a height of a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
want to mock 32 inches for a height of a
railing<00:00:29.240> okay<00:00:30.240> now<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> subtract

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
railing okay now what I have to subtract

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.389 
railing okay now what I have to subtract
is<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.570> thickness<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.530> railing<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
is the thickness of the railing and the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
is the thickness of the railing and the
height<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.880> bracket<00:00:36.329> okay<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.140> order<00:00:37.380> for

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
height of the bracket okay in order for

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
height of the bracket okay in order for
me<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> measure<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
me to do that I have to measure the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
me to do that I have to measure the
railing<00:00:39.860> diagonally<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.370> see

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
railing diagonally because if you see

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.709 
railing diagonally because if you see
it's<00:00:41.730> gonna<00:00:41.850> sit<00:00:42.090> parallel<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's gonna sit parallel with the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.060 
it's gonna sit parallel with the
stairway<00:00:43.079> okay<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.820> measures<00:00:46.070> three

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
stairway okay so that measures three

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
stairway okay so that measures three
inches<00:00:47.430> diagonally<00:00:48.149> think<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> part<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
inches diagonally think of this part of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.410 
inches diagonally think of this part of
the<00:00:49.980> leg<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> frame<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.820> square<00:00:51.030> under

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the leg of the frame and square under

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.990 
the leg of the frame and square under
the<00:00:51.449> railing<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> part<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> wall

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
the railing in this part the wall

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.189 
the railing in this part the wall
holding<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.360> against<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> bottom<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
holding it up against the bottom of the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
holding it up against the bottom of the
railing<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.590> against<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> wall<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:57.059> center

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
railing and against the wall the center

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
railing and against the wall the center
of<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.690> hole<00:00:57.989> down<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> bottom<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.010> three

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of that hole down the bottom is three

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
of that hole down the bottom is three
inches<00:00:59.730> okay<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.449> means<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
inches okay so that means I want to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.219 
inches okay so that means I want to
subtract<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> total<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.250> six<00:01:02.699> inches<00:01:03.120> off<00:01:03.989> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
subtract a total of six inches off of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
subtract a total of six inches off of
that<00:01:04.350> 32<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.610> will<00:01:05.790> establish<00:01:06.119> where<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that 32 and that will establish where I

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960 
that 32 and that will establish where I
want<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> bracket<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> wall
