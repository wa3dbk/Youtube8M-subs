00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
is the final live rock layout that have

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.660 
is the final live rock layout that have
for<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> tank<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:13.040> replace<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> rock<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.549> was

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
for the tank I replace the rock that was

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.800 
for the tank I replace the rock that was
here<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:18.170> this<00:00:19.170> rock<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
here with this one this rock here is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.730 
here with this one this rock here is
very<00:00:21.810> porous<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.740> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.580> branchy<00:00:24.560> if<00:00:25.560> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
very porous and kind of branchy if you

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.919 
very porous and kind of branchy if you
notice<00:00:27.050> so<00:00:29.000> definitely<00:00:30.000> had<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> keep<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
notice so definitely had to keep that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.590 
notice so definitely had to keep that
one<00:00:33.860> what<00:00:34.860> else<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.250> course<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.059> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
one what else of course that one that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.850 
one what else of course that one that
was<00:00:36.840> from<00:00:37.550> previous<00:00:38.550> order<00:00:40.370> also<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:42.860> changed

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
was from previous order also I changed

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
was from previous order also I changed
out<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.899> rock<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:47.360> with

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
out the the one rock that was here with

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.479 
out the the one rock that was here with
this<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.469> looks<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:49.860> better

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.490 

to<00:00:53.489> Fiji<00:00:53.969> rock<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:55.730> gotta<00:00:56.730> say<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:58.340> not<00:00:59.340> as

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
to Fiji rock I gotta say is not as

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
to Fiji rock I gotta say is not as
impressive<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.789> Caribbean<00:01:03.449> rock<00:01:05.390> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
impressive as the Caribbean rock this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.230 
impressive as the Caribbean rock this
being<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> Caribbean<00:01:07.790> all<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> ones<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
being the Caribbean all the ones that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.170 
being the Caribbean all the ones that
kind<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> look<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.760> don't<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> they

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
kind of look like I don't know that they

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
kind of look like I don't know that they
have<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> texture<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:14.520> one

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
have a lot of texture to it that one

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.170 
have a lot of texture to it that one
that<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.490> piece<00:01:23.180> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that one this one that little piece you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
that one this one that little piece you
know<00:01:24.920> although<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.820> fiji<00:01:27.330> did<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
know although the the fiji did have a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
know although the the fiji did have a
ton<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.770> ton<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.900> stuff<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.560> over<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.100> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
ton of a ton of stuff all over it you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.000 
ton of a ton of stuff all over it you
know<00:01:32.960> live<00:01:33.960> stuff<00:01:34.909> looked<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.119> good<00:01:36.390> but

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.410 

for<00:01:39.870> structure<00:01:40.870> wise<00:01:41.110> i<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> caribbean

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
for structure wise i think the caribbean

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.590 
for structure wise i think the caribbean
looks<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.740> lot<00:01:45.310> better<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.650> know<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.450> why

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
looks a lot better but you know it's why

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.320 
looks a lot better but you know it's why
you<00:01:49.660> have<00:01:49.900> more<00:01:50.770> than<00:01:50.830> one<00:01:50.980> type<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.340> rock<00:01:51.700> in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
you have more than one type of rock in

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you have more than one type of rock in
your<00:01:52.750> system<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:54.910> get<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.210> best<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:56.110> try<00:01:56.290> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
your system to get the best to try to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.950 
your system to get the best to try to
get<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.650> best<00:01:56.770> look<00:01:59.700> an<00:02:00.700> update<00:02:00.910> on<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.390> some

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.630 

before<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:07.360> was<00:02:07.480> real<00:02:07.870> loud<00:02:08.399> splashing<00:02:09.399> from

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
before it was real loud splashing from

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.090 
before it was real loud splashing from
the<00:02:10.890> from<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.030> skimmer<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.380> did<00:02:14.620> was<00:02:14.650> added

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
the from the skimmer all I did was added

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.760 
the from the skimmer all I did was added
this<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:16.660> team

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
this this team

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.850 
this this team
you<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.430> open<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> top<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
you know open on the top and on the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.840 
you know open on the top and on the
bottom<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:23.090> bottom<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.630> slightly<00:02:23.990> submerged

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
bottom the bottom is slightly submerged

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.000 
bottom the bottom is slightly submerged
and<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.180> reduce<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.780> noise<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:28.240> ton<00:02:30.010> it's

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and that reduce the noise a ton it's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.180 
and that reduce the noise a ton it's
just<00:02:31.280> insane<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:31.970> how<00:02:32.120> much<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.480> reduced<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
just insane I'm how much it reduced it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.570 
just insane I'm how much it reduced it
so<00:02:35.440> I'm<00:02:36.440> kind<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.710> worried<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.100> how<00:02:37.130> that's

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
so I'm kind of worried on how that's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.270 
so I'm kind of worried on how that's
going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.850> work<00:02:37.910> out<00:02:38.240> when<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.480> have<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
going to work out when I have the the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.270 
going to work out when I have the the
macro<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.440> we'll<00:02:42.590> see<00:02:42.800> later<00:02:43.840> also

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
macro in there so we'll see later also

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.800 
macro in there so we'll see later also
I'm<00:02:46.280> starting<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:48.340> install<00:02:49.340> my<00:02:49.370> my<00:02:50.240> auto<00:02:50.450> top

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
I'm starting to install my my auto top

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.670 
I'm starting to install my my auto top
off<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:52.730> going<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.910> be<00:02:53.060> gravity-fed

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.750 

basically<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:58.670> float<00:02:59.060> valve<00:02:59.360> as<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:01.610> loop

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
basically this float valve as the loop

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.760 
basically this float valve as the loop
as<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.680> level<00:03:03.680> drops<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:05.270> opens<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.960> valve<00:03:06.140> here

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
as a level drops it opens the valve here

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.190 
as a level drops it opens the valve here
and<00:03:07.390> water<00:03:08.390> will<00:03:08.630> start<00:03:08.780> pouring<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:11.200> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and water will start pouring in and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.720 
and water will start pouring in and
that's<00:03:12.860> gravity<00:03:13.340> fed<00:03:15.010> here<00:03:16.420> I'll<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:18.730> kind

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
that's gravity fed here I'll have kind

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.830 
that's gravity fed here I'll have kind
of<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> stand<00:03:20.450> or<00:03:20.840> whatever<00:03:21.140> or<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.610> cabinet

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
of like a stand or whatever or a cabinet

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.540 
of like a stand or whatever or a cabinet
to<00:03:23.840> hold<00:03:24.350> most<00:03:24.680> my<00:03:24.920> fish<00:03:25.430> junk<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.550> the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
to hold most my fish junk and and the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.730 
to hold most my fish junk and and the
reservoir<00:03:29.120> itself<00:03:29.209> which<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.290> just<00:03:30.470> a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
reservoir itself which is just a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:38.320 
reservoir itself which is just a
Rubbermaid<00:03:34.900> one<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.020> these<00:03:36.170> things<00:03:37.270> put<00:03:38.270> that

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
Rubbermaid one of these things put that

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.370 
Rubbermaid one of these things put that
down

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
down

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.430 
down
you<00:03:41.380> know

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
you know

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:53.600 
you know
I've<00:03:44.010> mattered<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.860> drain<00:03:50.250> right<00:03:50.550> there

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.560 

and<00:03:54.150> it's<00:03:54.330> just<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:56.150> kind<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:57.330> just

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
and it's just the kind that you just

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.620 
and it's just the kind that you just
slip<00:03:57.900> on<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:59.220> know<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.460> slip<00:03:59.790> on<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.360> the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
slip on you know you slip on the the

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.720 
slip on you know you slip on the the
tube<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.140> there<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.890> will<00:04:02.010> lock<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:04.730> it'll

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
tube in there and it will lock and it'll

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.460 
tube in there and it will lock and it'll
be<00:04:06.920> kind<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.980> like<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:10.200> know<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:13.290> it's

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
be kind of like this you know so it's

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.479 
be kind of like this you know so it's
higher<00:04:13.770> than<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.650> it'll<00:04:16.650> be<00:04:16.680> gravity-fed

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
higher than that so it'll be gravity-fed

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.690 
higher than that so it'll be gravity-fed
um<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.859> course<00:04:20.130> it's<00:04:20.250> not<00:04:20.310> going<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.579> be

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
um but of course it's not going to be

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.640 
um but of course it's not going to be
like<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.120> there's<00:04:21.720> going<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> be<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.109> cabinet

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
like this there's going to be a cabinet

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:32.990 
like this there's going to be a cabinet
there<00:04:22.940> something<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.380> matches<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:28.280> um

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.500 

from<00:04:33.630> now<00:04:33.810> on<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.110> guess<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:36.120> just<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.480> to

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
from now on I guess it's just going to

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.330 
from now on I guess it's just going to
be<00:04:36.570> updates<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:39.230> on<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.680> chemistry<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.250> the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
be updates on on the chemistry of the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.000 
be updates on on the chemistry of the
tank<00:04:41.840> right<00:04:42.840> now<00:04:45.140> since<00:04:46.140> i<00:04:46.260> added<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:47.150> fiji

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
tank right now since i added the fiji

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.200 
tank right now since i added the fiji
the<00:04:50.010> ammonia<00:04:50.550> came<00:04:50.970> up<00:04:51.150> slightly<00:04:51.570> and

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
the ammonia came up slightly and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.990 
the ammonia came up slightly and
nitrites<00:04:54.210> are<00:04:54.360> still<00:04:54.630> real<00:04:54.870> high<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.970> a

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
nitrites are still real high so it a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.140 
nitrites are still real high so it a
long<00:04:57.240> way<00:04:57.420> so<00:04:58.410> i<00:04:58.470> got<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.680> wait<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:59.160> the

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
long way so i got to wait in the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:08.519 
long way so i got to wait in the
meantime<00:05:01.520> i'm<00:05:02.520> getting<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.940> lot<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:06.200> algae

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:08.529 
meantime i'm getting a lot of algae

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.149 
meantime i'm getting a lot of algae
you<00:05:09.159> know<00:05:09.309> a<00:05:09.339> lot<00:05:09.729> of<00:05:10.829> looking<00:05:11.829> more<00:05:11.979> like<00:05:12.129> a

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
you know a lot of looking more like a

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.299 
you know a lot of looking more like a
forest<00:05:12.759> in<00:05:12.939> there<00:05:13.149> than<00:05:13.389> anything<00:05:14.309> you're

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:15.309 
forest in there than anything you're

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:22.340 
forest in there than anything you're
pretty<00:05:15.639> soon<00:05:16.589> see<00:05:17.589> all<00:05:17.739> that

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.010 

so

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.230 

once<00:05:26.650> i'm<00:05:26.830> done<00:05:26.860> cycling<00:05:27.550> it's<00:05:27.759> this<00:05:28.060> thing

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
once i'm done cycling it's this thing

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.119 
once i'm done cycling it's this thing
this<00:05:28.539> stuff<00:05:28.780> is<00:05:28.930> going<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.139> be<00:05:29.259> all<00:05:29.590> over<00:05:29.650> the

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
this stuff is going to be all over the

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.559 
this stuff is going to be all over the
place<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.669> my<00:05:30.759> cleanup<00:05:31.150> crew<00:05:31.300> is<00:05:31.360> going<00:05:31.449> to

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
place and my cleanup crew is going to

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.360 
place and my cleanup crew is going to
have<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:32.580> field<00:05:33.580> day<00:05:33.960> eating<00:05:34.960> at<00:05:35.259> all<00:05:35.440> you're

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
have a field day eating at all you're

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.480 
have a field day eating at all you're
going<00:05:36.460> to<00:05:36.520> be<00:05:36.610> nice<00:05:36.819> and<00:05:36.849> fat<00:05:41.220> since<00:05:42.220> I've

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
going to be nice and fat since I've

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.480 
going to be nice and fat since I've
turned<00:05:43.090> down<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:43.870> lighting<00:05:44.669> if<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:47.340> go<00:05:48.340> back

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
turned down the lighting if you go back

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.559 
turned down the lighting if you go back
to<00:05:48.550> my<00:05:48.819> last<00:05:49.060> videos<00:05:49.560> I've<00:05:50.560> had<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.860> sigh<00:05:51.129> I<00:05:51.159> know

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
to my last videos I've had a sigh I know

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.860 
to my last videos I've had a sigh I know
bacteria<00:05:52.569> problem<00:05:53.759> and<00:05:54.759> I<00:05:54.970> just<00:05:55.180> expected

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
bacteria problem and I just expected

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.200 
bacteria problem and I just expected
it's<00:05:56.080> just<00:05:56.650> because<00:05:57.039> the<00:05:57.370> lighting<00:05:57.669> was<00:05:57.940> too

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
it's just because the lighting was too

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.680 
it's just because the lighting was too
much<00:05:59.759> and<00:06:00.759> because<00:06:00.909> of<00:06:01.060> all<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.330> excess

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
much and because of all the excess

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.659 
much and because of all the excess
nutrients<00:06:02.169> in<00:06:02.289> there<00:06:02.470> due<00:06:02.889> to<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.069> cycling

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
nutrients in there due to the cycling

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.999 
nutrients in there due to the cycling
and<00:06:03.849> all<00:06:03.940> that<00:06:05.039> but<00:06:06.039> the<00:06:06.400> cyano<00:06:06.970> is<00:06:07.860> looks<00:06:08.860> like

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
and all that but the cyano is looks like

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.689 
and all that but the cyano is looks like
it's<00:06:09.190> receding<00:06:10.740> it<00:06:11.740> doesn't<00:06:12.009> look<00:06:12.069> at<00:06:12.250> slimy

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
it's receding it doesn't look at slimy

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:19.860 
it's receding it doesn't look at slimy
anymore<00:06:13.240> you<00:06:13.360> know<00:06:15.509> so<00:06:16.509> it<00:06:16.840> looks<00:06:16.870> dull<00:06:18.870> so

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
anymore you know so it looks dull so

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:29.750 
anymore you know so it looks dull so
yeah<00:06:23.490> I<00:06:25.680> think<00:06:26.680> that's<00:06:27.039> it

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.540 

my<00:06:30.300> next<00:06:30.630> video<00:06:30.960> I<00:06:33.110> guess<00:06:34.110> it<00:06:35.010> will<00:06:35.100> be<00:06:35.250> a<00:06:35.280> while

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
my next video I guess it will be a while

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.530 
my next video I guess it will be a while
unless<00:06:36.480> I<00:06:36.720> do<00:06:36.780> something<00:06:37.130> you<00:06:38.130> know<00:06:38.480> now<00:06:39.480> you

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
unless I do something you know now you

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.980 
unless I do something you know now you
know<00:06:39.720> what<00:06:39.870> I'll<00:06:40.020> have<00:06:41.300> I'll<00:06:42.300> have<00:06:42.510> a<00:06:42.540> video

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
know what I'll have I'll have a video

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.610 
know what I'll have I'll have a video
when<00:06:43.440> all<00:06:43.590> this<00:06:43.770> is<00:06:43.830> set<00:06:44.220> up<00:06:45.290> let<00:06:46.290> you<00:06:46.440> guys

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
when all this is set up let you guys

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.460 
when all this is set up let you guys
know<00:06:46.890> how<00:06:47.070> well<00:06:47.310> that<00:06:47.340> works<00:06:47.930> I'm<00:06:48.930> expecting

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
know how well that works I'm expecting

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.680 
know how well that works I'm expecting
it'll<00:06:49.680> work<00:06:49.830> out<00:06:49.950> real<00:06:50.250> well<00:06:50.280> the<00:06:51.240> reason<00:06:51.570> why

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
it'll work out real well the reason why

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.120 
it'll work out real well the reason why
I<00:06:51.720> went<00:06:52.020> with<00:06:52.410> them<00:06:52.620> the<00:06:53.280> gravity-fed<00:06:53.730> is<00:06:55.130> it's

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
I went with them the gravity-fed is it's

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.410 
I went with them the gravity-fed is it's
not<00:06:56.370> dependent<00:06:57.090> on<00:06:58.370> on<00:07:00.410> you<00:07:01.410> know<00:07:01.530> electronics

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 
not dependent on on you know electronics

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.980 
not dependent on on you know electronics
which<00:07:03.420> I<00:07:03.570> like<00:07:04.700> of<00:07:05.700> course<00:07:06.060> this<00:07:06.480> valve<00:07:06.810> here

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
which I like of course this valve here

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.510 
which I like of course this valve here
could<00:07:07.380> fail<00:07:08.270> and<00:07:09.270> so<00:07:09.720> I<00:07:09.750> think<00:07:09.960> I<00:07:10.290> might

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
could fail and so I think I might

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:18.380 
could fail and so I think I might
actually<00:07:11.520> add<00:07:12.060> an<00:07:12.330> electronic<00:07:13.050> element<00:07:17.390> kind

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.390 
actually add an electronic element kind

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.160 
actually add an electronic element kind
of<00:07:18.450> like<00:07:18.660> right<00:07:18.930> after<00:07:19.140> the<00:07:19.650> drain<00:07:21.080> maybe<00:07:22.080> a

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170 
of like right after the drain maybe a

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.430 
of like right after the drain maybe a
solid<00:07:22.620> wood<00:07:22.800> that's<00:07:23.370> hooked<00:07:23.550> up<00:07:23.820> to<00:07:24.030> a<00:07:24.410> to<00:07:25.410> a

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
solid wood that's hooked up to a to a

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.200 
solid wood that's hooked up to a to a
level<00:07:26.690> to<00:07:27.690> another<00:07:27.870> float<00:07:28.320> valve<00:07:28.620> that<00:07:29.210> the

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
level to another float valve that the

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.640 
level to another float valve that the
big<00:07:30.420> sense<00:07:31.140> is<00:07:31.350> that<00:07:31.380> it's<00:07:31.650> high<00:07:31.890> up<00:07:32.810> here<00:07:33.810> you

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
big sense is that it's high up here you

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:42.250 
big sense is that it's high up here you
know<00:07:34.680> it'll<00:07:35.570> it'll<00:07:36.570> shut<00:07:36.870> off<00:07:37.080> this<00:07:37.350> line<00:07:38.570> so

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.260 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.960 

because<00:07:43.260> I<00:07:43.350> am<00:07:43.530> paranoid<00:07:43.920> with<00:07:44.490> all<00:07:44.760> this

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
because I am paranoid with all this

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.700 
because I am paranoid with all this
stuff<00:07:45.300> leaking<00:07:45.870> everywhere<00:07:46.610> so<00:07:48.410> all<00:07:49.410> right

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:50.710 
stuff leaking everywhere so all right

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.840 
stuff leaking everywhere so all right
if<00:07:51.670> you<00:07:51.820> have<00:07:51.910> any<00:07:52.090> comments<00:07:52.800> suggestions

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850 
if you have any comments suggestions

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.740 
if you have any comments suggestions
whatever<00:07:55.050> let<00:07:56.050> me<00:07:56.140> know<00:07:57.180> all<00:07:58.180> right<00:07:58.240> till<00:07:58.630> next

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:58.750 
whatever let me know all right till next

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.900 
whatever let me know all right till next
time
