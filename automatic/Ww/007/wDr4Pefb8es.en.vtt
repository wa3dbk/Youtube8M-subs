00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
scrunching them up for a more

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.770 
scrunching them up for a more
dimensional<00:02:06.659> look<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:08.090> found<00:02:09.090> these<00:02:09.270> leaves<00:02:09.539> at

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
dimensional look I found these leaves at

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.990 
dimensional look I found these leaves at
hobby<00:02:09.989> lobby<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.860> cut<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> base<00:02:11.400> off<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
hobby lobby and I cut the base off so
they<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.569> slide<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:12.989> underneath<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.590> flower

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
they can slide up underneath my flower

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.250 
they can slide up underneath my flower
I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.910> my<00:02:15.390> flowers<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.959> better<00:02:16.170> that
