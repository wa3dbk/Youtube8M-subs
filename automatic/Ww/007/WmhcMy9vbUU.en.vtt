types<00:05:08.330> of<00:05:08.510> signal<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:09.080> should<00:05:09.350> turn<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.710> off

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
types of signal you should turn it off

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.500 
types of signal you should turn it off
but<00:05:10.340> then<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.640> will<00:05:10.790> reduce<00:05:11.180> motion

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
but then you will reduce motion

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.890 
but then you will reduce motion
resolution<00:05:12.190> but<00:05:13.190> if<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.460> want<00:05:13.900> sharper

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
resolution but if you want sharper

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.030 
resolution but if you want sharper
resolution<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.950> go<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.190> user<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.990> then<00:05:18.040> with

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
resolution you go to user and then with

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.290 
resolution you go to user and then with
settings<00:05:19.430> details<00:05:21.190> what<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.340> do<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.760> you

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
settings details what you do is you

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.340 
settings details what you do is you
reduced<00:05:23.780> each<00:05:24.050> other<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.740> 0<00:05:25.070> and<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.970> blue<00:05:26.350> you

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
reduced each other to 0 and the blue you

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.010 
reduced each other to 0 and the blue you
can<00:05:27.560> leave<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.860> 5<00:05:28.160> or<00:05:28.460> or<00:05:28.790> even<00:05:29.180> increase<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.780> 10

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
can leave it 5 or or even increase to 10

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.190 
can leave it 5 or or even increase to 10
then<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:31.100> will<00:05:31.310> give<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:32.570> best<00:05:32.810> motion

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
then this will give you the best motion

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.380 
then this will give you the best motion
resolution<00:05:33.890> without<00:05:36.430> implementing<00:05:37.430> so

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.409
