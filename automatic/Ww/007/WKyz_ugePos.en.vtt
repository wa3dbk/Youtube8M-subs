00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
Megaman X and apparently that was just

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.070 
Megaman X and apparently that was just
for<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.030> display<00:06:11.420> they're<00:06:11.630> not<00:06:11.720> going<00:06:11.900> making

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
like the shot things that showed a

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.500 
like the shot things that showed a
couple<00:06:15.770> of<00:06:15.920> the<00:06:16.040> little<00:06:16.250> helmet<00:06:16.610> you<00:06:17.420> know

couple of the little helmet you know
shell<00:06:17.810> guys<00:06:18.130> as<00:06:19.130> well<00:06:19.460> as<00:06:19.700> a<00:06:19.730> little<00:06:20.000> explosion

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
shell guys as well as a little explosion

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.420 
shell guys as well as a little explosion
effect<00:06:20.990> that<00:06:21.170> made<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.680> look<00:06:21.770> like<00:06:21.980> one<00:06:22.400> of

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
effect that made it look like one of

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.190 
effect that made it look like one of
them<00:06:22.580> was<00:06:22.700> exploding<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.720> you<00:06:23.840> could<00:06:23.960> set

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
them was exploding that you could set

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.020 
them was exploding that you could set
him<00:06:24.320> down<00:06:24.380> so<00:06:24.770> I<00:06:24.980> don't<00:06:25.280> know<00:06:25.520> why<00:06:25.670> that<00:06:25.850> I<00:06:25.910> was

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
him down so I don't know why that I was

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.430 
him down so I don't know why that I was
hoping<00:06:26.510> those<00:06:26.660> would<00:06:26.810> come<00:06:26.990> with<00:06:27.140> him<00:06:27.260> because

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
hoping those would come with him because

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.870 
hoping those would come with him because
I<00:06:27.500> thought<00:06:27.620> that<00:06:27.680> would<00:06:27.860> have<00:06:27.950> been<00:06:28.040> neat<00:06:28.220> way

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
I thought that would have been neat way

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.120 
I thought that would have been neat way
to<00:06:28.910> display<00:06:29.420> him<00:06:29.630> firing<00:06:30.320> off<00:06:30.500> his<00:06:30.680> shots<00:06:30.950> and

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
to display him firing off his shots and

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.620 
to display him firing off his shots and
having<00:06:31.400> won<00:06:31.550> a<00:06:31.580> couple<00:06:31.970> of<00:06:32.030> Oh<00:06:32.120> helmet<00:06:32.450> guys

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630
