point in doing it and when you're in a

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.170 
point in doing it and when you're in a
group<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.459> people<00:04:14.610> who<00:04:14.790> know<00:04:14.970> what<00:04:15.000> they're

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
group of people who know what they're

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.640 
group of people who know what they're
doing<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:15.840> don't<00:04:16.020> need<00:04:16.140> quick<00:04:16.380> revive

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
doing you really don't need quick revive

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.560 
doing you really don't need quick revive
so<00:04:16.919> juggernaut<00:04:17.520> for<00:04:17.730> me<00:04:17.850> was<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.390> obvious

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
so juggernaut for me was the obvious

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.510 
so juggernaut for me was the obvious
choice<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:19.560> allows<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.980> take<00:04:20.160> more<00:04:20.370> hits

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
choice it allows you to take more hits

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.820 
choice it allows you to take more hits
up<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.910> 4<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.690> some<00:04:21.930> cases<00:04:22.169> even<00:04:22.350> five

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
up to 4 and in some cases even five

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.670 
up to 4 and in some cases even five
depending<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:23.970> mapper<00:04:24.180> you

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
depending on what mapper you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.439 
depending on what mapper you
what<00:04:24.830> circumstances<00:04:25.520> you're<00:04:25.669> in<00:04:25.820> but

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
what circumstances you're in but

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.360 
what circumstances you're in but
honestly<00:04:26.720> it's<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.289> best<00:04:27.560> prick<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.949> use<00:04:28.130> when

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
honestly it's the best prick to use when

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.830 
honestly it's the best prick to use when
you're<00:04:28.460> playing<00:04:28.699> solo<00:04:29.210> when<00:04:29.419> you're<00:04:29.539> playing

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
you're playing solo when you're playing

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.810 
you're playing solo when you're playing
in<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.500> group<00:04:30.770> because<00:04:31.039> it<00:04:31.280> allows<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.699> get

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
in a group because it allows you to get

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.240 
in a group because it allows you to get
through<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> swarm<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.870> people<00:04:33.080> without<00:04:33.710> having

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
through a swarm of people without having
