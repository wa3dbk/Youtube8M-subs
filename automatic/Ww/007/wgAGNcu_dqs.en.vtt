of<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> game<00:01:35.229> as<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.829> as<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.640> rolls<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.329> crew

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
of the game as it as it rolls the crew

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.169

at<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.840> bottom<00:01:38.229> for<00:01:39.070> an<00:01:39.250> NES<00:01:39.579> games<00:01:39.880> game<00:01:40.030> has

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
at the bottom for an NES games game has

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.760 
at the bottom for an NES games game has
probably<00:01:40.450> one<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.689> longest<00:01:41.289> credit

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
probably one of the longest credit

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.499 
probably one of the longest credit
sequences<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:43.420> any<00:01:43.929> video<00:01:44.320> game<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:46.420> he

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
sequences in any video game like he

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.330 
sequences in any video game like he
didn't<00:01:46.750> see<00:01:46.899> many<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.319> these<00:01:47.409> types<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:48.009> credit

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
didn't see many of these types of credit

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.700 
didn't see many of these types of credit
screens<00:01:48.700> until<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.270> SNES<00:01:49.689> days<00:01:50.079> which

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
screens until like the SNES days which

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.990 
screens until like the SNES days which
is<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.950> time<00:01:51.189> in<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.369> game<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.670> think<00:01:51.700> came

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
is the time in this game I think came

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.880 
is the time in this game I think came
out<00:01:52.119> nine<00:01:52.299> be<00:01:52.450> too<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.929> the<00:01:53.020> SNES<00:01:53.380> was<00:01:53.590> already

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
out nine be too so the SNES was already

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.499 
out nine be too so the SNES was already
on<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.130> market<00:01:54.429> so<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.000> already<00:01:55.149> had<00:01:55.360> this

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
on the market so you already had this

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.149 
on the market so you already had this
more<00:01:55.719> elaborate<00:01:56.200> credit<00:01:56.590> sequences<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:59.159> this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
more elaborate credit sequences but this

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.800 
more elaborate credit sequences but this
is<00:02:00.340> probably<00:02:00.429> one<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.819> longer<00:02:01.240> ones<00:02:01.509> in

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
is probably one of the longer ones in

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.639 
is probably one of the longer ones in
terms<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.259> NES<00:02:02.590> at<00:02:02.799> least
