whatnot<00:01:51.500> take<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> socket<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.820> here

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
whatnot take you a socket right here

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.380 
whatnot take you a socket right here
like<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.740> take<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.920> socket<00:01:56.460> put<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
like this take your socket put it on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.580 
like this take your socket put it on
this<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.219> how<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.549> up<00:02:00.439> make<00:02:01.439> sure

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this way and see how that's up make sure

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
this way and see how that's up make sure
the<00:02:01.710> angle<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.909> ranch<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.540> up

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
the angle of your ranch is up

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.109 
the angle of your ranch is up
then<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.200> take<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.620> like<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.370> you

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
then you can take it like this and you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.540 
then you can take it like this and you
have<00:02:08.149> leverage<00:02:08.960> put<00:02:09.229> your<00:02:09.410> hand<00:02:09.710> but<00:02:10.100> one<00:02:10.280> hand

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
have leverage put your hand but one hand

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.630 
have leverage put your hand but one hand
right<00:02:10.759> here<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:11.960> hand<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:12.440> here<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:12.980> then

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
right here and one hand up here and then

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.970 
right here and one hand up here and then
that<00:02:13.820> way<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.420> help<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.320> break<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.800> loose

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
that way you can help to break it loose

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.980 
that way you can help to break it loose
I've<00:02:16.400> got<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.850> tightening<00:02:17.360> right<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:17.690> so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
I've got it on tightening right now so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.830 
I've got it on tightening right now so
this<00:02:18.140> would<00:02:18.290> be<00:02:18.380> tightening<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:20.390> way<00:02:20.660> it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
this would be tightening this way it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.350 
this would be tightening this way it
would<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:21.190> loosening<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.550> then<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.150> have

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
would be loosening and then you have

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.900 
would be loosening and then you have
more<00:02:23.690> leverage<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:25.280> crank<00:02:25.550> into<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.000> bolt

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
more leverage to crank into that bolt

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.510 
more leverage to crank into that bolt
all<00:02:28.910> right<00:02:29.120> mass<00:02:29.630> airflow<00:02:29.840> sensor<00:02:30.520> right

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
all right mass airflow sensor right

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.870 
all right mass airflow sensor right
there<00:02:32.350> there's<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.800> bolt<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.490> bolt<00:02:34.730> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
there there's this bolt in this bolt and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.610 
there there's this bolt in this bolt and
this<00:02:35.060> piece<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.360> slides<00:02:35.900> right<00:02:36.050> out<00:02:36.200> after

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
this piece just slides right out after

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.310 
this piece just slides right out after
you<00:02:36.830> take<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> plug<00:02:37.370> off<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.300> plug<00:02:38.600> on<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
you take the plug off the plug on the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.980 
you take the plug off the plug on the
underside<00:02:39.890> has<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.490> little<00:02:40.850> clip<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.780> pull

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
underside has a little clip you pull

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.140 
underside has a little clip you pull
that<00:02:42.140> clip<00:02:42.350> down<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.700> pull<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.030> plug

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that clip down and you can pull the plug

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.660 
that clip down and you can pull the plug
out<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.739> that's<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:46.040> there<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.550> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
put the two little screws back in fairly

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.510 
put the two little screws back in fairly
tight<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.900> you're<00:02:51.410> done

I<00:02:52.580> also<00:02:53.060> did<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.330> starter<00:02:53.780> which<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.470> didn't<00:02:55.459> even

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
I also did a starter which I didn't even

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.240 
I also did a starter which I didn't even
want<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.350> video<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.410> haven't<00:02:57.770> done<00:02:57.830> any

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
videos put a new battery and what else

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.729 
videos put a new battery and what else
which<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.239> checked<00:03:06.140> all<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.380> intake<00:03:06.709> and

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
which I checked all the intake and

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.220 
which I checked all the intake and
cleaned<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.340> all<00:03:07.489> out<00:03:07.700> because<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.930> got<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
cleaned it all out because it's got a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.350 
cleaned it all out because it's got a
flow<00:03:10.130> system<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.670> comes<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.090> through<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
flow system that comes in through the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120 
flow system that comes in through the
bottom<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.810> there<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.290> does<00:03:12.470> get<00:03:12.709> up<00:03:12.830> in<00:03:12.980> there

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
bottom and there it does get up in there

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.440 
bottom and there it does get up in there
so<00:03:13.310> every<00:03:13.489> now<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.700> again<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:14.030> need<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.269> clean
