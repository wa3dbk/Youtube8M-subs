00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
you can mix up the more expensive so

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.760

obviously this is more expensive than

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.309 
obviously this is more expensive than
this<00:05:32.039> is<00:05:32.219> more<00:05:32.400> expensive<00:05:32.610> but<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.750> one<00:05:34.139> year

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
this is more expensive but the one year

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.559 
this is more expensive but the one year
time<00:05:34.440> are<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.250> meeting<00:05:35.279> that<00:05:35.819> that<00:05:36.360> one<00:05:36.539> is

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
actually less expensive so that's a
