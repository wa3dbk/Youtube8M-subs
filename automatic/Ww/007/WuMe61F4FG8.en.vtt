Hey everyone! This is Jessica from JewelryTutorialHQ.com
and Bespangled Beads on Etsy.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.780
In this video I'm going to show you how to
make this reclaimed braided leather bracelet

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.690
with snaps and all. This type of braid is
known as the 'inside trick braid' or the 'magic

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.400
braid' because both of the ends are completely
intact as you can see.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.939
You'll find a complete list of all of the
tools and supplies needed for this project

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.589
below the video on YouTube or on JewelryTutorialHQ.com

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.519
I'm using some nice soft supple leather that
I salvaged from an old handbag in another

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.600
video, but whichever leather you want to use,
make sure that it's flexible.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.850
You're going to want to cut a strip that is
at least 1 and a half inches wide, and I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.420
going to give you a formula to help you figure
out the length that you need to start with.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.659
First, you need to figure out the length you
want your finished bracelet to be and be sure

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.920
to include room for overlap at the ends for
the clasp, which should be about 1 inch.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.729
Multiply that number by 1.3 to account for
shrinkage.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.729
For example - if you want a 7.5 inch fit,
then you're going to start with 7.5 inches,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.829
add 1 inch for the overlap of the clasp at
the ends, and you get 8.5 inches.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.950
That's the number you want to multiply by
1.3 to account for the length lost from braiding.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.579
So in this example, the number that we get
is approximately 11 inches, which is what

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.749
I'm starting with.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:49.749
Now we need to mark and divide this strip
into 3 equal parts so for this 1 and a half

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:57.819
inch wide strip, I'm going to mark it at half
inch intervals in several places along the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.139
strip so that I can connect the lines easily.

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:07.729
Remember that we're not going to cut all the
way to the end. I like to leave a ruler's

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.569
width of space at each end, which is an inch
and a quarter (1.25")

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.010
I'm going to use a metal edged ruler to cut
- make sure your knife is nice and sharp or

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.849
you will get jagged edges on your leather.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.650
Now we're finally ready to get to the fun
part! Go ahead and use some masking tape to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.019
tape your leather down to the table.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.760
And we're going to braid in sections. We're
going to do right over middle, left over middle,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.030
then right over middle, and since we started
on the right we're going to take the end and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.580
pass it through the gap on the right side
and it's going to twist up the end there.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.580
Now continue - left over middle, right over
middle, then left over middle, then stop and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.790
pass the end through the gap on the left side
and it will straighten out the braid at the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.890
bottom.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.500
Now a little bit more slowly: we're back to
the right side. Right, left, right, then the

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.930
end goes through the hole on the right side.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.930
Then left, right, left, and pass the end through
the hole on the left side to straighten it

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.189
back out again.

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:39.189
Back to right, left, right, and yes, we are
running out of room but I can still get this

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.170
end back through the hole on the right side.

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.079
Since we always need to work in an even number
of sections, that means that I'm going to

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:00.079
have to tighten up the braid at the top so
that I can get one last sequence of the left-right-left

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.299
in there and straighten out the end.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.379
I'm going to tug on these pieces and braid
it a little tighter at the top just to make

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.079
a little bit of room for me down here.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.860
Ok, I think I can make it - left, right, left
and back through one last time on the left

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.110
side so we can get it all straightened out
at the end.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.560
Now to add the snaps, I'm using some Dritz
snap setting pliers. These are the ones that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.230
can accommodate several different kinds of
snaps.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.560
You want to make sure the rubber rings are
on like this.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.560
We are going to start with the prong side,
and it goes in the bottom part of the jaw.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.450
The 'bottom' is the one that doesn't have
the yellow plastic piece on it.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.450
At the top on the yellow side, we are going
to put the 'male' component and center it

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.950
on the piece of leather. Make sure you're
at least a half inch in, and squeeze the pliers

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.560
tight to set the snap.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.440
Now for the other end, this one's a little
bit harder to figure out - there are two sides

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.680
to this piece. One is almost flush and the
other, the middle part sticks out a little

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.680
bit. Where the middle part sticks out, that
needs to face UP when you set it in the bottom

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.190
jaw of the pliers.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.800
Now I'm using these faux pearl snaps, and
just from past experience, these pliers can

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.100
kind of scratch the top so even though it
makes it a little more tricky to get in there,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.160
I'm just putting some masking tape over it
to protect it from being scratched.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.700
We're going to do the same as before. Just
center the pliers with the snap in them over

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.910
your leather end about the same distance in
as you did on the other side, and squeeze

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.950
really tight.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.650
By the way, if you're just using plain snaps,
you won't need the tape for this step, so

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.510
it will be a little bit easier for you.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.510
Now we have a finished bracelet with a working
snap clasp, but I prefer the way it looks

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.120
when the ends are rounded so I'm just going
to trim these up using these sharp fabric

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.630
scissors and round off the corners a little
bit. And you can also take care of any extra

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.130
leather that you might have at the ends here
at this point.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.940
So that's it you guys! I hope you let me know
if you have any questions - I know you will :)
