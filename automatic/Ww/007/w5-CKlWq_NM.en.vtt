00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
not an ambidextrous clip I really would

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.150 
not an ambidextrous clip I really would
like<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.630> see<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> Mersenne<00:04:07.290> just<00:04:07.500> go<00:04:07.769> ahead<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
like to see a Mersenne just go ahead and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.099 
like to see a Mersenne just go ahead and
drill<00:04:08.579> these<00:04:08.700> out<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.180> know<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.390> can<00:04:09.660> send<00:04:10.049> them

who want to carry their knives they're

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.610 
who want to carry their knives they're
folding<00:04:18.419> tactical<00:04:18.810> knives<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.200> their<00:04:19.440> weak

folding tactical knives on their weak

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.740 
folding tactical knives on their weak
side<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.950> think<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.640> it's<00:04:20.910> important<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.510> have

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
side I think that it's important to have

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.589 
side I think that it's important to have
an<00:04:22.340> ambidextrous<00:04:23.340> clip<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:23.849> least<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> option

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
an ambidextrous clip at least the option

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.960 
an ambidextrous clip at least the option
to<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:25.500> swap<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.979> over<00:04:26.310> so

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
to to swap this over so

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.130 
to to swap this over so
would<00:04:27.120> love<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.330> see<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.810> kind<00:04:28.020> of

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
would love to see that kind of

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.140 
would love to see that kind of
refinement<00:04:28.500> maybe<00:04:28.950> one<00:04:29.220> day<00:04:29.430> Emerson<00:04:29.880> will<00:04:30.000> do

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
refinement maybe one day Emerson will do

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.770 
refinement maybe one day Emerson will do
it<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:31.050> not<00:04:31.800> holding<00:04:32.130> my<00:04:32.190> breath<00:04:32.220> really

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
it but not holding my breath really

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.330 
it but not holding my breath really
let's<00:04:33.780> take<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> look<00:04:34.170> at<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.290> deployment<00:04:34.920> this

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
let's take a look at the deployment this

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.030 
let's take a look at the deployment this
one<00:04:35.550> uses<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:36.060> large<00:04:36.570> thumb<00:04:37.020> disk<00:04:37.290> nice<00:04:37.770> black

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
one uses a large thumb disk nice black

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.010 
one uses a large thumb disk nice black
thumb<00:04:38.280> disk<00:04:38.520> can't<00:04:39.180> say<00:04:39.360> I'm<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.510> huge<00:04:39.780> fan<00:04:39.990> of

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
thumb disk can't say I'm a huge fan of

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.410 
thumb disk can't say I'm a huge fan of
the<00:04:40.230> thumb<00:04:40.380> disk<00:04:40.590> but<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:40.920> doesn't<00:04:41.220> work<00:04:41.420> what

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
the thumb disk but it doesn't work what

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.960 
the thumb disk but it doesn't work what
I<00:04:42.450> am<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.870> big<00:04:43.140> fan<00:04:43.170> of<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.220> wave<00:04:44.430> feature

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
I am a big fan of is the wave feature

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.150 
I am a big fan of is the wave feature
and<00:04:45.300> most<00:04:46.170> people<00:04:46.470> are<00:04:46.560> going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> already

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
and most people are going to already

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.100 
and most people are going to already
know<00:04:47.250> what<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.520> wave<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:48.000> for<00:04:48.780> those<00:04:48.930> who

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
know what the wave is for those who

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.920 
know what the wave is for those who
don't<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.550> little<00:04:51.300> protrusion

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
don't this is a a little protrusion

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.840 
don't this is a a little protrusion
that's<00:04:52.140> used<00:04:52.560> for<00:04:52.680> rapid<00:04:53.220> deployment<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.700> your

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
that's used for rapid deployment of your

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.910 
that's used for rapid deployment of your
knife<00:04:54.000> you've<00:04:54.600> got<00:04:54.750> in<00:04:54.840> your<00:04:54.930> pocket<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.770> as

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
knife you've got in your pocket and as

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.460 
knife you've got in your pocket and as
you're<00:04:56.130> drawing<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.760> out<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:57.030> your<00:04:57.090> pocket<00:04:57.470> it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
you're drawing it out of your pocket it

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.010 
you're drawing it out of your pocket it
catches<00:04:59.010> on<00:04:59.040> this<00:04:59.490> on<00:04:59.700> this<00:05:00.360> wave<00:05:00.600> on<00:05:00.900> this

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
catches on this on this wave on this

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.200 
catches on this on this wave on this
hook<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:02.010> literally<00:05:02.280> just<00:05:02.610> shoots<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
hook and it literally just shoots the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.720 
hook and it literally just shoots the
blade<00:05:03.390> open<00:05:03.570> like<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.740> if<00:05:05.370> you're<00:05:05.610> going

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
blade open like that so if you're going

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.880 
blade open like that so if you're going
to<00:05:05.820> use<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.090> wave<00:05:06.300> pretty<00:05:06.750> much<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.050> fast<00:05:07.620> as

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
to use the wave pretty much as fast as

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.080 
to use the wave pretty much as fast as
you<00:05:08.040> can<00:05:08.220> draw<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.460> knife<00:05:08.670> out<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:09.000> your

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
you can draw the knife out of your

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.880 
you can draw the knife out of your
pocket<00:05:09.480> that's<00:05:09.720> how<00:05:09.900> fast<00:05:10.140> it's<00:05:10.380> gonna<00:05:10.500> deploy

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
pocket that's how fast it's gonna deploy

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.090 
pocket that's how fast it's gonna deploy
it's<00:05:11.310> really<00:05:11.640> cool<00:05:11.900> great<00:05:12.930> great<00:05:13.470> innovation

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
it's really cool great great innovation

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.680 
it's really cool great great innovation
so<00:05:14.450> big<00:05:15.450> fan<00:05:15.720> of<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.960> wave<00:05:16.460> lock<00:05:17.460> up<00:05:17.700> is<00:05:17.910> really

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
so big fan of the wave lock up is really

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.750 
so big fan of the wave lock up is really
nice<00:05:18.870> you've<00:05:19.560> got<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> titanium<00:05:20.340> liner<00:05:20.490> lock

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
nice you've got a titanium liner lock

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.120 
nice you've got a titanium liner lock
here<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.450> engages<00:05:21.810> early<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.800> engages

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
here it engages early and it engages
