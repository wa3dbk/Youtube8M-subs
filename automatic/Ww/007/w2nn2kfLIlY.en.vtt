00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.650
 Hello everyone, today we're talking about a tweak 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.730
 which will allow us to expand the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 functions within our counter 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.529
 feels default 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.630
 we have the possibility for how much 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.849
 they concern the togas at the top therefore 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.360
 buttons that we find in the band in 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.970
 high we only have the possibility of 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.460
 activate or deactivate airplane mode 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.070
 wifi bluetooth 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.400
 the mode does not disturb the block 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.250
 of default screen rotation 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.290
 nothing else can be done 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.120
 activate or deactivate in another 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.000
 except then the beautiful calculator la 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.329
 camera the torch of the timer that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.540
 we have at the bottom with the tweak that lives 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.340
 to show we could instead expand i 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.120
 enough band buttons 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.549
 let's see how then obviously we will have to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.990
 not always have a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.990
 iphone a jailbroken iphone 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.290
 we must go then subsidy 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.770
 the tweak is called the flip control center 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.020
 you find it already by default is free 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.050
 simply looking for flip control 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.360
 center photographers authors ryan petrich 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:33.200
 as you can see this is the package 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.200
 official press on install confirmation 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.930
 and restart the springboard 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.899
 we are waiting for a terminal 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.990
 we see the changes very well 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.530
 then we always have five buttons 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.549
 malt, however, as you can see if I run towards 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.030
 left with a swipe I have already added 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.860
 by default from the tuik the buttons of the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.220
 localization this the exact for 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:19.100
 even write a text message 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.330
 on the fly the silent flight and the network 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.150
 cell phone and then we have the vibration 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.010
 vpn settings the here we have the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.069
 internet tethering 3g and on 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.069
 talking going in the settings 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 we find 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.610
 smith control center from which we cook 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.610
 to the menu 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:01.300
 this is the list in a nutshell 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:06.540
 of the tops we can have in the bar 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.540
 at the top of the behavior 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.380
 this is the exact one available therefore 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.530
 we can move them for example the auto loc 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.750
 we want it after in degree the nation loc 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.030
 so we put it as we can 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.760
 move at our leisure 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.860
 so that we find the ones we use first 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.840
 more often and after those we use more 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.150
 we can rarely decide how many 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.720
 items display on each page 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.430
 currently we are 5 we can 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.290
 get to 6 and then we have others 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.090
 settings that 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.500
 can you can try treats only 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.379
 of display settings of 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.180
 goito clerc and then we find ourselves the 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:03.269
 control center is a very useful tweak 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 I would say because it allows us to do many 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:11.060
 daily actions such as me 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:16.169
 I'm off 3g rather than 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.030
 activate write in a sms and go 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.530
 talking much faster 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.110
 than we currently do 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.509
 control center on the s7 help is a bit 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.060
 limited let's say you can activate 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.070
 and disable only basic things 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.289
 with this tweak instead you can 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.930
 increase the buttons present and then 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.050
 to be able to do on the fly 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.380
 many more things I hope this guide 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.960
 was useful to you 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.530
