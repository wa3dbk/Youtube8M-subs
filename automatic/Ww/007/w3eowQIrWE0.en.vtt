I'm<00:00:00.359> replacing<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.989> bars<00:00:01.230> with<00:00:01.530> club<00:00:01.770> mins

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.750 
I'm replacing the bars with club mins

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.120 
I'm replacing the bars with club mins
probably<00:00:03.750> not<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> uncork<00:00:04.529> it<00:00:04.740> sounds

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
probably not going to uncork it sounds

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.550 
probably not going to uncork it sounds
pretty<00:00:05.279> nice<00:00:05.400> with<00:00:05.609> vance<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.029> hines<00:00:06.560> and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
pretty nice with vance and hines and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.470 
pretty nice with vance and hines and
then<00:00:07.740> i'm<00:00:07.859> probably<00:00:08.519> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.150> try<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.330> get

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
then i'm probably going to try and get

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.810 
then i'm probably going to try and get
new<00:00:09.630> filters<00:00:10.250> thinking<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.400> taking<00:00:11.610> off

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
new filters thinking about taking off

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.780 
new filters thinking about taking off
the<00:00:12.000> gauge<00:00:12.300> cluster<00:00:12.330> either<00:00:13.049> all<00:00:13.349> free<00:00:13.740> or<00:00:14.730> i

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the gauge cluster either all free or i

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.279 
the gauge cluster either all free or i
might<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.269> leave<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> speed<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.929> even

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
might just leave the speed on even

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.599 
might just leave the speed on even
though<00:00:16.379> i<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> speedo<00:00:17.010> cable<00:00:17.100> since<00:00:17.520> i

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
though i have not a speedo cable since i

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
though i have not a speedo cable since i
bought<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.940> thing<00:00:18.150> ok<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.470> gauge<00:00:19.680> cluster

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
bought the thing ok so my gauge cluster

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670 
bought the thing ok so my gauge cluster
is<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.490> gone<00:00:20.869> everything<00:00:21.869> still<00:00:22.109> functions

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
is now gone everything still functions
