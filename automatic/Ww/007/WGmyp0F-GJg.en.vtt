00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.080 
sift it if you don't have one to two
hours<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:58.109> sift<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.500> straight<00:00:58.829> away

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
hours you can just sift it straight away

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
hours you can just sift it straight away
we're<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> add<00:01:00.930> approximately

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
we're also going to add approximately

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950 
we're also going to add approximately
1/3<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.250> cup<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.579> lemon<00:01:03.000> juice<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
1/3 of a cup of lemon juice and all the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.410 
1/3 of a cup of lemon juice and all the
spices<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.589> salt<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> chili<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> turmeric<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
spices to salt the chili the turmeric it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
spices to salt the chili the turmeric it
does<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.840> there's<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.560> chili

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
does look like there's a lot of chili

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.550 
does look like there's a lot of chili
because<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.369> 3<00:01:08.670> teaspoons<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:10.380> we

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because it's 3 teaspoons but when we

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.060 
because it's 3 teaspoons but when we
cook<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.630> meat<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.110> barbecue<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
cook the the meat on the barbecue the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
cook the the meat on the barbecue the
heat<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.460> burns<00:01:14.939> off<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> chili<00:01:15.900> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
heat actually burns off all the chili so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
heat actually burns off all the chili so
it's<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.530> spicy<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.280> cooked

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's not very spicy when it's cooked

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.929 
it's not very spicy when it's cooked
we're<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.189> put<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> meat<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
we're going to put the meat on the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.300 
we're going to put the meat on the
skewers<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.689> we've<00:01:22.110> used<00:01:22.320> bamboo<00:01:22.680> skewers

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
skewers and we've used bamboo skewers

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
skewers and we've used bamboo skewers
this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.360> their<00:01:24.960> nice<00:01:25.200> easy

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
this is because on their nice easy

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.020 
this is because on their nice easy
disposable<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.400> they're<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.610> cheap<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
disposable and they're very cheap you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.929 
disposable and they're very cheap you
can<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.479> pick<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.439> big<00:01:29.009> set<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.700> we

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
can just pick up on a big set like we

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
can just pick up on a big set like we
have<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.450> $1<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> supermarket<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> we've

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
have for $1 at the supermarket and we've

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.749 
have for $1 at the supermarket and we've
soaked<00:01:33.000> these<00:01:33.270> overnight<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
soaked these overnight so that the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
soaked these overnight so that the
advantage<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
advantage of that is that then the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.340 
advantage of that is that then the
skewer<00:01:37.380> doesn't<00:01:37.680> burn<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.990> don't<00:01:40.170> have

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
skewer doesn't burn so if you don't have

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.929 
skewer doesn't burn so if you don't have
overnight<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.340> soak<00:01:41.460> them<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.670> hot

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
overnight you can just soak them in hot

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.460 
overnight you can just soak them in hot
water<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:42.780> hours<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
water for one to two hours and that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.039 
water for one to two hours and that
usually<00:01:43.979> works<00:01:44.189> too<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.600> we're<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
usually works too and now we're going to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.830 
usually works too and now we're going to
barbecue<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> meat<00:01:47.180> it's<00:01:48.180> important<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
barbecue the meat it's important that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.620 
barbecue the meat it's important that
when<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.670> put<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> meat<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.119> ski<00:01:51.450> where

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
when you put the meat on the ski where
