weight it's a slow gradual process it

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.769 
weight it's a slow gradual process it
doesn't<00:00:22.410> seem<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.680> way<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> because

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
doesn't seem that way but it is because

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.970 
doesn't seem that way but it is because
just<00:00:25.140> 100<00:00:25.920> extra<00:00:26.250> calories<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.000> day<00:00:27.260> one<00:00:28.260> extra

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
just 100 extra calories a day one extra

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.630 
just 100 extra calories a day one extra
mik<00:00:29.220> ultra<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.920> 100<00:00:31.920> extra<00:00:32.189> calories<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> day

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
mik ultra is 100 extra calories a day

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
mik ultra is 100 extra calories a day
and<00:00:32.940> after<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.329> year<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.690> 10<00:00:33.960> pounds

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and after one year that's 10 pounds

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.119 
and after one year that's 10 pounds
after<00:00:35.160> 5<00:00:35.520> years<00:00:35.550> that's<00:00:36.210> 50<00:00:36.690> pounds<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.290> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
after 5 years that's 50 pounds so you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
after 5 years that's 50 pounds so you
can<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.850> how<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.809> delicate<00:00:40.260> balance<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
can see how it's a delicate balance and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.000 
can see how it's a delicate balance and
most<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.610> us<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.329> gaining<00:00:42.840> 10<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.680> 20

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
most of us are not gaining 10 to 20

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
most of us are not gaining 10 to 20
pounds<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> year<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.989> slow<00:00:46.320> gradual

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
pounds a year it's a slow gradual

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.260 
pounds a year it's a slow gradual
process<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:47.910> extra

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
process because we have these extra

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
process because we have these extra
calories<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.620> don't<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.039> burned<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.640> so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
calories that don't get burned off so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.290 
calories that don't get burned off so
after<00:00:51.960> 4<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.440> 5<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.949> 6<00:00:52.980> years<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.640> 20<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.090> 30

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
after 4 or 5 or 6 years we're 20 or 30

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
after 4 or 5 or 6 years we're 20 or 30
pounds<00:00:54.480> overweight<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.370> think

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pounds overweight so when you think

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
pounds overweight so when you think
about<00:00:56.610> calories<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.079> terms<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.710> all

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
about calories think in terms of all

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.270 
about calories think in terms of all
those<00:00:59.430> few<00:00:59.940> extra<00:01:00.239> calories<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:02.129> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
those few extra calories that don't get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.579 
those few extra calories that don't get
utilized<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.090> again<00:01:03.359> stick<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
utilized that again stick around to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
utilized that again stick around to
eventually<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.460> us<00:01:05.670> overweight<00:01:06.119> over<00:01:06.390> over

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
eventually make us overweight over over

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.820 
eventually make us overweight over over
time<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.240> terms<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.810> people<00:01:10.650> don't

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
time so I think in terms of people don't

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070 
time so I think in terms of people don't
understand<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> concepts<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.360> getting<00:01:12.990> an

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
understand the concepts of getting an

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
idea of how much you eat that's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.109

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
important get a calorie breakdown and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.700 
important get a calorie breakdown and
then<00:01:18.360> get<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> general<00:01:18.869> idea<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> proteins

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
then get a general idea of the proteins

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.460 
then get a general idea of the proteins
fats<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> carbohydrates<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:21.150> remember

utilization<00:02:55.420> another<00:02:56.420> problem<00:02:57.020> is<00:02:57.170> that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
utilization another problem is that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.000 
utilization another problem is that
people<00:02:58.090> would<00:02:59.090> rather<00:02:59.270> whine<00:03:00.170> about<00:03:00.440> it

then work for it you know well I'm just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.340 
then work for it you know well I'm just
not<00:03:04.430> gonna<00:03:04.700> well<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.420> know<00:03:07.360> oK<00:03:08.360> we've<00:03:09.140> all

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.110 
not gonna well you know oK we've all
been<00:03:09.530> around<00:03:09.740> those<00:03:09.980> people<00:03:10.460> they're<00:03:10.940> on<00:03:11.090> a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
been around those people they're on a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.530 
been around those people they're on a
constant<00:03:11.930> diet<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.350> don't<00:03:12.560> care<00:03:12.800> what<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.310> is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
constant diet I don't care what it is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.090 
constant diet I don't care what it is
they're<00:03:14.540> always<00:03:14.720> whining<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.410> bitching<00:03:15.830> they

want somebody to hand them the results

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.950 
want somebody to hand them the results
another<00:03:18.950> problem<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:20.060> people<00:03:20.330> have<00:03:20.840> this

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
another problem is that people have this

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.950 
another problem is that people have this
perception<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.620> weight<00:03:22.490> loss<00:03:22.960> should

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
perception that weight loss should

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.630 
perception that weight loss should
happen<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.800> saw<00:03:25.070> this<00:03:25.190> guy<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.430> TV

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
lost 10 pounds in a week really

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.890 
lost 10 pounds in a week really
yeah<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.920> saw<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> guy<00:03:28.460> who<00:03:28.520> delivered<00:03:29.240> pizza<00:03:29.630> to

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
yeah I saw a guy who delivered pizza to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.110 
yeah I saw a guy who delivered pizza to
a<00:03:29.930> place<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.890> he<00:03:31.070> had<00:03:31.190> sex<00:03:31.460> with<00:03:31.580> three<00:03:31.700> women

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
a place and he had sex with three women

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.680 
a place and he had sex with three women
do<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.690> think<00:03:32.870> that's<00:03:33.020> true<00:03:33.430> probably<00:03:34.430> not<00:03:34.690> so

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
do you think that's true probably not so

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.880 
do you think that's true probably not so
again<00:03:36.140> people<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.650> misperception

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
again people have this misperception

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.690 
again people have this misperception
that<00:03:37.610> weight<00:03:38.450> loss<00:03:38.480> should<00:03:38.930> happen<00:03:39.350> rapidly

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
that weight loss should happen rapidly

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700 
that weight loss should happen rapidly
well<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.790> know<00:03:40.910> what<00:03:41.090> normal<00:03:42.020> weight<00:03:42.380> gain

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
well you know what normal weight gain

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.370 
well you know what normal weight gain
doesn't<00:03:43.340> happen<00:03:43.520> rapidly<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.930> happens

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
doesn't happen rapidly it happens

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.680 
doesn't happen rapidly it happens
gradually<00:03:45.680> over<00:03:46.310> time<00:03:46.340> because<00:03:47.270> it's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
gradually over time because it's

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.180 
gradually over time because it's
happened<00:03:48.020> rapidly<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.650> do<00:03:48.800> something<00:03:49.130> about

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
happened rapidly you do something about

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.000 
happened rapidly you do something about
it<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:50.210> happens<00:03:50.570> slowly<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.350> gradually<00:03:51.500> it's

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
it it happens slowly and gradually it's

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.010 
it it happens slowly and gradually it's
imperceptible<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.360> don't<00:03:53.750> even<00:03:53.810> notice

imperceptible so you don't even notice

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.670 
imperceptible so you don't even notice
it<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.800> weight<00:03:55.160> loss<00:03:55.490> is<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.820> gradual<00:03:56.390> process

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
it so weight loss is a gradual process

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.160 
it so weight loss is a gradual process
remember<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:58.040> thousand<00:03:58.910> calorie<00:03:59.420> deficit

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
remember a thousand calorie deficit

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.130 
remember a thousand calorie deficit
every<00:04:01.070> day<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:01.520> seven<00:04:01.820> days<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.540> two-pound

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
every day for seven days is a two-pound

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.470 
every day for seven days is a two-pound
loss<00:04:03.410> over<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.010> course<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.030> week<00:04:05.210> and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
loss over the course of a week and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.040 
loss over the course of a week and
that's<00:04:06.050> serious<00:04:06.770> weight<00:04:07.250> loss<00:04:07.490> so<00:04:08.480> if<00:04:08.810> you're

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
that's serious weight loss so if you're

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.230 
that's serious weight loss so if you're
a<00:04:09.080> bigger<00:04:09.410> guy<00:04:09.530> or<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.130> bigger<00:04:10.580> woman<00:04:10.820> you<00:04:11.090> can

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
a bigger guy or a bigger woman you can

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.870 
a bigger guy or a bigger woman you can
expect<00:04:11.540> maybe<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.810> little<00:04:11.959> bit<00:04:12.140> more<00:04:12.320> than<00:04:12.470> that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
expect maybe a little bit more than that

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.910 
expect maybe a little bit more than that
but<00:04:13.880> it's<00:04:14.120> really<00:04:14.420> back<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.020> the<00:04:15.110> basics<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.800> I

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
but it's really back to the basics and I

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.770 
but it's really back to the basics and I
don't<00:04:15.980> really<00:04:16.280> care<00:04:16.580> what<00:04:16.790> your<00:04:16.970> diet<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.510> if

McDonald's<00:04:23.600> every<00:04:23.690> day<00:04:23.990> you'll<00:04:24.770> lose<00:04:25.040> weight

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
McDonald's every day you'll lose weight

very<00:04:26.460> plain<00:04:26.760> very<00:04:27.060> simple<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.560> get<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.160> handle

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
very plain very simple so get a handle

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.310 
very plain very simple so get a handle
on<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:30.030> total<00:04:30.419> number<00:04:30.630> of<00:04:30.690> calories<00:04:30.900> you're

on the total number of calories you're
taking<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.860> that'll<00:04:32.430> give<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> baseline

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
taking in that'll give you a baseline
