00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.060
 welcome to synthesis my name 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.280
 It's sabina calatayud 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.430
 during my 36 years of experience as 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.860
 pharmaceutical company I had to attend to many 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.500
 cases with skin problems and also of 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.990
 nutrition is where I found 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.540
 truly my vocation in how could I 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.000
 solve those cases was elaborating 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.880
 many masterful formulas with success 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.370
 really with answers and then I left 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 specializing in homeopathy in medicine 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.350
 naturist in orthopedics in analysis 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.750
 clinical these specialties me 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.840
 they served to find the real focus 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.560
 of the human being is a set not a 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.460
 separate part 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.890
 we create two lines a cosmetics creating 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.130
 health because everything that is in the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.260
 outside will penetrate internally another 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.630

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.480
 the perfect and healthy skin and I can 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 say of the cosmetics the components 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.229

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.450
