vehicle and it's it's sized properly so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.990 
vehicle and it's it's sized properly so
you<00:00:40.680> don't<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.070> shimmy<00:00:41.370> things<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you don't have like shimmy things in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
you don't have like shimmy things in
there<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> same<00:00:42.629> sizes<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.680> also

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
there like the same sizes as of you also

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
there like the same sizes as of you also
type<00:00:44.550> batteries<00:00:45.090> that's<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.690> vehicle

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
type batteries that's in your vehicle

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.770 
type batteries that's in your vehicle
now<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.550> also<00:00:47.700> Anita<00:00:48.239> approaches

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
now and then they also Anita approaches

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.080 
now and then they also Anita approaches
is<00:00:49.200> four<00:00:49.559> terminals<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.370> these<00:00:50.850> four

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
is four terminals and these four

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.410 
is four terminals and these four
terminals<00:00:51.800> minimizes<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.270> inventory<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
terminals minimizes the inventory that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
terminals minimizes the inventory that
dealers<00:00:54.719> need<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.590> even<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
dealers need to have or even on the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
dealers need to have or even on the
manufacturing<00:00:57.360> cost<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.170> overall<00:00:58.500> costs

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
manufacturing cost so your overall costs

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
manufacturing cost so your overall costs
will<00:00:59.039> come<00:00:59.309> down<00:00:59.370> work<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.420> start<00:01:00.660> powered

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
will come down work with start powered

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.439 
will come down work with start powered
batteries<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.920> keep<00:01:02.100> them<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> shelf<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
batteries to keep them on the shelf and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
batteries to keep them on the shelf and
another<00:01:03.930> added<00:01:04.260> feature<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> start

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
another added feature with the start

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
another added feature with the start
power<00:01:06.150> lift<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:06.990> balancing<00:01:07.590> board<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.280> can

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
power lift about balancing board you can

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.630 
power lift about balancing board you can
use<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.180> start<00:01:09.450> power<00:01:09.630> lower<00:01:10.140> cost<00:01:10.640> charger

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
use some start power lower cost charger

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
use some start power lower cost charger
if<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.060> doing<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> battery

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
if you're doing like a battery
