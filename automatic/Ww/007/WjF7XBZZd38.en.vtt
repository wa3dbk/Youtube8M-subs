00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 new league from megaman so here 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.130
 this is sometimes a thick spoiler 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 Warnings are not saved 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.410
 he wants to get out there because we 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.240
 show you which new mode in the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.580
 melting pot from next week in it 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 will be and of course, which weekly 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.359
 So we'll get a strike from here 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 please switch off if there is nothing from the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.300
 So we want to know that now 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.090
 Together there is the new strike 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.059
 be in the valley on the venus and indeed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.190
 when nexus hear that will be for the one 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.120
 or others will be a very good info and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.079
 it will be apprenticeship to be active 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.610
 very good 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.370
 Here we also have ethical 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.460
 Active means the opponent has strong 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.530
 Shields and angry so the opponents 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.789
 they are just looking for the conflict 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.739
 not then somehow away if you the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.230
 then come directly to me 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.670
 Renter and juggler is also still 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 Active that means if you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 For example, with a primary weapon 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 a kill then makes no ammo 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 for primary weapons job 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.119
 that will be the function juggler 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.369
 prevent dawn so much 3 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
 combo to the weekly heroic 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.580
 strike of course will also be on the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 Venus play no active with juggler 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 elemental damage but certainly 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 to endure because the nexus hear this 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 strike is one of the easiest or 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 at least the community thinks that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.159
 one of the easiest is also in the speed 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.810
 you can playlist in normal rock 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.979
 simply by swiftly that takes no 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.170
 seven minutes 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.270
 and here you can also very much the opponents 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.659
 well out of the way 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.430
 okay that would be it to these 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.770
 strike we come now to the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.659
 melting pot news because there was yes 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 also something laid and that com on 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.030
 Tuesday two mode online that would be 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
 namely recovery three against three 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.229
 if she does not know that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.700
 you test times is time based 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.890
 is not always active on everyone 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.350
 worth a round and there are 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 news about inferno mode because that is 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.420
 also be active from tuesday and indeed 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.970
 the whole conflict is six against 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.710
 six 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.140
 the inferno version still existed 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.450
 not that will be quite interesting 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.730
 he is allowed here the radar top left 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.950
 completely omitted in any case 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.900
 very blatant feeling when you look at yourself 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.540
 also quite differently oriented one hears 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.370
 more yes you it's just very very 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.350
 Hard you look very often on the radar 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.760
 and can guess a bit how 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.240
 far I can get out of here 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.530
 trust 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.840
 without that directly me about the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.220
 heap shoots with the pumpgun that will 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.290
 then not be the case anymore 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.170
 you should definitely try out and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.180
