00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.959
 in this part of the review I will tell you in detail 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 on zoom h6 recording features and formats 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.260
 Let's probably start with the function with a record or 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.220
 how in russian when recording your six 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 automatically record the background 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 all that happens all the time then when 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.320
 you press the record button it saves 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.660
 last two seconds of recording before 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.539
 pressing the button and substitutes their beginning 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.550
 the main session record file as if 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.890
 six began to write in two 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 seconds earlier than you actually had 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.810
 press the record button thanks 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.730
 backup record function your nerves will be in 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.710
 rest 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.750
 backup record is complete security from 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 overload distortion if the function 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 Included in the process of writing to and files 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.079
 six automatically records 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.050
 duplicate sound modular microphone 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.180
 nose reduced by 12 decibels even levels 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.489
 if the original track is recorded with 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.589
 overload distortion then its spare 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.719
 option is likely to be fine you 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.360
 can listen to this garden file in 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.670
 backup file section in project menu 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 if the function was used you will hear 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 option with reduced level further you 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.280
 will be able to use any of them for 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.280
 modular master track 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.040
 autorecord feature allows sixes 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 automatically start recording when it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 will detect a certain level of sound 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 volume for this you must enable 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.740
 I will change the function then press the button 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.020
 record six will not start recording 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.479
 immediately and go to standby and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 as soon as the input signal reaches 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.600
 the threshold you set the recorder will start 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600
 a record 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.610
 also this function implies 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.799
 similar procedure 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.079
 autorecord stop auto 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.329
 termination of records as soon as the threshold 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.540
 the signal will be below the specified value 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.030
 six writes formats wav or mp3 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.549
 up to 6 monov and files or shake and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.819
 respectively, and he writes in the following 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.000
 resolution from 44 kilohertz to 96 and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.700
 kilohertz 24 bit all recorded in and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.469
 files automatically receive temporary 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.880
 tags that make them completely 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.340
 compatible 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 ksb and format which is necessary for 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.880
 synchronization with video in post-production 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.980
 also you can use the six in 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.650
 quality usb audio interface 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.810
 computer and apple fans can 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 connect six what's gonna be true 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.160
 need additional lotion 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.490
 camera connection kit price of this story 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.890
 around 10 dollars on ebay when in 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.170
 the menu would have selected item stereo mix then 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.380
 six acts as two by two 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.920
 audio interface and that is, two inputs and 2 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.170
 output 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.800
 when installed on multitrack it works 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.080
 as interface 6 to 2 i.e. 6 inputs and 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240
 2 outputs built-in mixer six 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.030
 allows you to create custom 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.900
 stereo or 6 road mixes for output 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.850
 via username 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.500
 sixes available decent set 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.390
 effects that allows you to give 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.460
 complete view of your records and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.560
 compensate for various problems and 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.200
 imperfections in room acoustics 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.270
 which is written as a filter 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.610
 allows you to delete the signal below 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.240
 defined assigned to users 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.270
 cleanliness 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.690
 the so-called cut-off frequency is useful 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.240
 to eliminate the claps of wind noise 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.650
 respiration resonance from the microphone and others 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.240
 kinds 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.580
 low frequency drone compression 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.770
 compression or limiter compensates 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.750
 level jumps in effect they act 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.690
 like automatic volume control 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.360
 sound reduces the level below the set 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.850
 threshold point the main difference between 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.190
 Them is that the limiter 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.190
 reduce loud sounds more strictly 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.070
 there is also a built-in metronome and 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.850
 chromatic tuner for electric guitars and 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.070
 bass guitars 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.070
 I think a musician will come in handy 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.840
 Well, let's summarize for dslr 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.239
 operators this device will bust 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.060
 Six is ​​big when you dress it up 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.060
 dslr camera shoe looks massive 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.280
 Well, the main thing will have to swing your hands and yes 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.300
 very rarely when shooting is needed for without 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.490
 6 channels 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.400
 during the review found the following 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.100
 minuses 2 inch screen which is promoting 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.900
 company zoom a little bit no ice 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.450
 viewing angle on the screen you need to watch 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.240
 clearly at a certain angle otherwise everything 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.580
 It becomes blurred and the most disappointing he 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.520
 it is scratched even from a special rag 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.160
 joystick controls it's just garbage I'm 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.290
 rarely if the zoom will lie on the floor either 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.590
 just above you will manage it 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.840
 unrealistically hard netsid microphone a bit 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.090
 gives more noise than the X model 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.850
 At first, I think we got this 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.490
 copy as it turned out such a trouble 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.280
 all I tried to connect the buttonhole 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.950
 sennheiser entrance minijack twist and 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.229
 so imagine she climbs through 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.260
 second ingenious system true with 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.090
 buttonhole addon everything was fine 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.430
 backup can be written only for 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.650
 removable module for explorer inputs 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.290
 backup can not do this trouble 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.910
 real Well if you have any 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.040
 questions write comments 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.900

 completely forgot to comment on the video and 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.800
 put huskies to see you soon
