we know the answer to that question is
42<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.609> isn't<00:01:03.480> too<00:01:03.600> helpful<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of secondary importance right now what

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.390 
of secondary importance right now what
is<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> primary<00:01:40.110> concern<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> would

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
is of primary concern is what it would

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
something what if the earth and the rest
