00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:25.500
 that put the phone the pencil of the way 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.779
 all that is a mini purse and pickpockets 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 little girl and quick to do what 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.510
 principal the first one we have to catch 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.630
 pretty much the measure so be like 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.330
 apply in 3b 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.490
 it looks good look if we put the tie the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.070
 we apply in three civil vale 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.030
 simply the fish has charm 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.730
 we cut so short at once seen well 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.620
 I cut one of the parts 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.620
 ok we imagine you're all 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.140
 we save this in the reserve 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.750
 when we have this, let's start 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.950
 we take phone I do not have the brand is 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.950
 new value win or nobody 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.880
 so sometimes this thing happens 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.190
 we improvise short everything you 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.190
 annoying let's go in here 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.650
 of a size as a reference because it is 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.000
 what we want 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.000
 well that is to say the Chilean 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.970
 watch this 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 It's called Rodrigo will be ashamed 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.979
 everything was talked about 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 the Chilean I married the Chilean say 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.400
 Chile 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.979
 so we could put texts here if 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:09.030
 smokes can put to stretch or after 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:11.430
 everything that does not but if from clown knows 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 the big tie can serve you well 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.270
 that what we are going to do we imagine that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.050
 we need for the phone until the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.050
 activate so I'm going to readjust 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.540
 here my tie cut a bit more 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.060
 short short what we're going to do 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.769
 just now remembering is a 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.319
 week I talked about the sticker 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.290
 fantastic cheap street 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.840
 dependence ok let's put here is 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.090
 Special for peeling the flame sticks 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.910
 mind that looks here a German name 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.069
 creative man butter is to say glue 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.069
 for fabric easier 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.440
 I would say that one thing if you have to 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.030
 cost two thousand I'm afraid that maximum me 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.290
 since I'm French, he always pays a little 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.290
 more because I have face 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.090
 much on the street because they are more 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.090
 cheap and I also like social point 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:28.670
 in the top part and we paste it like that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.760
 so that it is fixed in real but it would have 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.880
 that we're going to put 23 minutes what 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.019
 here makes it a quick person 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.610
 we have this that is going to start having what 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.290
 he asked something because there are a few days 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.230
 back is like an iron and I know what 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.069
 put here no no no we are not going to do it 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.440
 with iron 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.440
 today not after we have such a thing 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.390
 I call it scratch 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.440
 who also attends 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.950
 excited look at this is a velcro crack 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.110
 as I say as a feasible child that has 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.720
 two parts one part smoother the other 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:15.440
 part that gara worth is must pay 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:17.660
 grab grab hold and scratch for that 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.729
 that we have treated him and this one what 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.040
 It's great that it has glue 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:29.960
 also the all I street dependence my 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.260
 life happened here and everything is there is not 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.600
 great magical flex will suffice and so 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.580
 look for this by the general people 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.850
 he says he sees me look after what 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.850
 we make 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:46.739
 joy 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:49.080
 so it's ok I've removed a bit that 

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:52.769
 I'm going to talk, he has removed a bit 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.219
 of the folio and I put it here to the tip of 

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:58.289
 tie to the tip of the tie and the 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:01.229
 another side I do not take it 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.999
 not yet not because it helps me to take 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.009
 the measure sees that we're going to see that it 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:08.240
 close the bag so we put what 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.550
 we put here and here 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.380
 and now it opens and so left and so 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.440
 I can see where I want to put the other 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.280
 important part I repeat it leaves it 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.500
 closed puts it will be this a part and 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.300
 there, it helps you to point out where it will be 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.860
 the point where I'm going to show it to the 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.819
 camera like this 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:33.159
 why do you exist did you do this did you take the 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.159
 measure and then 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:42.099
 so this measure removes the plastic 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.279
 that there is behind plastic that a little leaf 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.910
 of plastic that protects the glue and 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:50.130
 I put it 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.690
 there is a version a bit that's pretty 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:06:00.820
 fast live here we were have here the 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:03.980
 small little bag that opens to fix it 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.360
 so that it is well ironed 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.810
 tool occupy the plate valga 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.420
 rounds 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.820
 I call it as well as more alternative what 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.470
 would leave towards the wave so active that 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.660
 each story 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.210
 you are going to ask me this yes that well 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.530
 nice but how is this so 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.490
 It's nice but it's not a bag 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:29.010
 how are we going to do it? 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.010
 we take this piece that was not here
