accidents so-called accidents all of
these<00:00:20.530> things<00:00:21.130> that<00:00:21.780> befall<00:00:22.780> us<00:00:23.080> in<00:00:23.410> our<00:00:23.529> lives

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
these things that befall us in our lives

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.929 
these things that befall us in our lives
are<00:00:25.380> ways<00:00:26.380> that<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:27.070> shadow<00:00:27.400> or<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
are ways that the shadow or the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:35.569 
are ways that the shadow or the
unconscious<00:00:28.810> is<00:00:29.020> going<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:30.240> affect<00:00:31.240> us<00:00:31.450> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.810 

these<00:00:36.579> are<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:37.360> what<00:00:37.540> we<00:00:37.660> call<00:00:37.900> accidents<00:00:38.820> we

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
these are so what we call accidents we

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.560 
these are so what we call accidents we
know<00:00:40.090> are<00:00:40.420> no<00:00:40.690> more<00:00:40.900> accidents<00:00:41.290> this<00:00:41.650> is<00:00:41.829> what

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
know are no more accidents this is what

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.940 
know are no more accidents this is what
you've<00:00:43.570> got<00:00:43.870> goosed<00:00:44.140> Oh<00:00:44.260> have<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.560> called

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
you've got goosed Oh have you called

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.480 
you've got goosed Oh have you called
synchronicity<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:47.020> Hume<00:00:47.290> works<00:00:47.590> with<00:00:47.920> one<00:00:48.400> of

synchronicity and Hume works with one of

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.380 
synchronicity and Hume works with one of
the<00:00:48.580> greatest<00:00:48.940> physicists<00:00:50.130> poly<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:52.030> and

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the greatest physicists poly and and and

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.010 
the greatest physicists poly and and and
and<00:00:52.750> they<00:00:52.930> both<00:00:53.200> proposed<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:54.160> new<00:00:54.700> extra<00:00:55.450> new

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
and they both proposed a new extra new

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.370 
and they both proposed a new extra new
explanatory<00:00:56.740> principle<00:00:58.080> which<00:00:59.080> is<00:00:59.230> not

explanatory principle which is not

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.580 
explanatory principle which is not
causality<00:01:00.040> but<00:01:00.190> which<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.520> synchronicity<00:01:01.210> as

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
course the law of attraction talked

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.250 
course the law of attraction talked
about<00:01:16.570> this<00:01:16.810> but<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.040> these<00:01:18.490> terms

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
about this but not in these terms

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.340 
about this but not in these terms
because<00:01:20.260> before<00:01:20.650> we<00:01:20.770> get<00:01:20.980> to<00:01:21.300> as<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:23.320> were
