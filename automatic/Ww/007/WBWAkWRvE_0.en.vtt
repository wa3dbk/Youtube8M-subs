00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
do that and it's weird because it's not

do that and it's weird because it's not
going<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.540> help<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.840> fading<00:04:05.170> factor<00:04:05.560> over

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
going to help the fading factor over

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.410 
going to help the fading factor over
time<00:04:06.010> are<00:04:06.790> they<00:04:06.910> just<00:04:07.120> prevents

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
time are they just prevents

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.789 
time are they just prevents
counterfeiting<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.350> that's<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
counterfeiting but is that's the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.100 
counterfeiting but is that's the
intention<00:04:09.190> but<00:04:09.580> if<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.060> gets<00:04:10.269> exposed<00:04:10.959> to

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
intention but if it gets exposed to

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.539 
intention but if it gets exposed to
light<00:04:11.230> over<00:04:11.440> time<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.950> part<00:04:12.220> will<00:04:12.340> lighten

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
light over time that part will lighten

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.449 
light over time that part will lighten
this<00:04:12.850> part<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.420> sticker<00:04:13.630> will<00:04:13.840> not<00:04:14.019> be<00:04:14.459> so

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
this part of the sticker will not be so

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.470 
this part of the sticker will not be so
good<00:04:15.670> like<00:04:15.849> that

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
good like that

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.940 
good like that
it<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:17.310> overall<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:20.050> high-end<00:04:20.440> approach<00:04:20.710> i

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
it so overall it's a high-end approach i

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.830 
it so overall it's a high-end approach i
a'n't<00:04:21.100> product<00:04:21.430> high<00:04:21.700> in<00:04:21.760> presentation<00:04:22.600> i

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
a'n't product high in presentation i

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.020 
a'n't product high in presentation i
think<00:04:23.800> it's<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.040> high-end<00:04:24.370> degrade<00:04:24.610> for<00:04:24.880> me

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
think it's a high-end degrade for me

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.480 
think it's a high-end degrade for me
yeah<00:04:26.020> it's<00:04:26.590> pretty<00:04:26.710> easy<00:04:26.920> there's<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.340> lot<00:04:27.430> of

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
yeah it's pretty easy there's a lot of

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.660 
yeah it's pretty easy there's a lot of
fun<00:04:27.700> um<00:04:28.350> not<00:04:29.350> enough<00:04:29.620> cards<00:04:29.950> for<00:04:30.160> me<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.280> like<00:04:30.550> to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
fun um not enough cards for me I like to

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.820 
fun um not enough cards for me I like to
get<00:04:30.790> more<00:04:31.060> right<00:04:31.390> more<00:04:31.570> cars<00:04:32.050> with<00:04:32.440> my<00:04:32.560> break
