 hi recruits 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.070
 hello recruits this week's theme 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.750
 consists in saying things that to all the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.340
 world likes you less and thinking 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.429
 that I have to honor my color at 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.900
 red a red food that I do not like I've 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.869
 I have been thinking a lot while 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.079
 Most red foods I like 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.329
 except the strawberries I hate them I hate 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.160
 dams there are lots of people on the planet 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.460
 that they love the prey so 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.730
 At the time of the snack they make a bowl 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.860
 with strawberries or rehearsed person to eat 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.690
 eat and I can not I can not see what 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.460
 you will do as super acid ballets and I 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.560
 they seem super disgusting i do not like them 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.450
 nothing then clear I could throw myself here 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.060
 ten years to explain to us how little I 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.420
 like strawberries or prove it 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.440
 some way and a pot of 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.140
 that filled them with strawberries or what a wonder 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.149
 who will pay them but here are our 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.270
 wonderful friends who are very rich 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.950

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.989

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.850

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 321 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 The days are not as expected as it is 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.410

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.950
 to be thinking but if it is not mounted 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.420
 because the ones made and I know it are the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.429
 things that happen in my life that do not 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.769
 They have any explanation no 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.560
