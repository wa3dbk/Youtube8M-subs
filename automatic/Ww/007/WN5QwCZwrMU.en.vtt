00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.850
 Hey you cavemen out there and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.939
 Longboard introduce video longboard 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.439
 I've got you guys last time 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.550
 video said i will be a new one 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.579
 bring long board 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.230
 and now I have brought my land and 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.230
 I'll get that for you now 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 I hope you can see it at all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.450
 I'll just blind you here in the picture 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.079
 on 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.489
 this is my new long and me 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.960
 can not so far go out with the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.090
 that you can see this all over 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 In any case, this is the logic 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.570
 dervish sammer since I have now 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:08.659
 the data amanda and 209 cm long 22 9 cm 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.990
 wide has a 80 cm wide wheelbase 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.369
 and the deck weight is off the deck 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.939
 here is depending on stain 1.4 to 1.6 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:25.439
 kilo and the complete board weight goes 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.130
 between 32 and 34 kilograms and it has 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 just what to do with which flexsys 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.229
 For example, I have flex 1 here 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.710
 I think that is a bit harder than you 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.860
 Now my little cat plays one 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.030
 lid in any case is that you that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 at that time I cost 309 euros 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.939
 Here priority is on this page 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.500
 The urls are a bit dirty because I'm in 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.450
 moment I see you after one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.909
 short fight again right up so people 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.180
 we are already that again 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:10.140
 produced 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.650
 That's my little babies again 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.379
 play to yours 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.360
 sister in any case I have it 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.430
 Now here in the back on it done 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.829
 that's going on but I think caught 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.079
 the board really really cool 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.720
 I'm so much more satisfied with that 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.000
 with my old board so I drive 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.519
 With so much that just has a great one 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.579
 form is deeper you can push better 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.280
 it is simply my opinion of 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.590
 overall feel better me 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.519
 iris you once briefly in the image to a 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.019
 Behind the back looks yes yes who to 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.670
 awkward to turn this around 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.489
 In any case, this is this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.900
 same word that the dena also have 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.849
 the dane has the loud of the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.849
 more effective and as I said almost at 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.800
 so that he will be back in the word 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.569
 now falling on your head 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.610
 is it going on and that is what it is 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.680
 paris axes that had 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.750
 I also had paris axes with me 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.180
 my last longboard i have to say 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.560
 I'm so happy people now 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.040
 Do not you think that's right 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.630
 cool really cool and I wanted 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.190
 in the video now also completely 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.230
 shortly after that point out that I too 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.459
 I have a live channel with you 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.350
 Just link in the video 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.910
 description and also from where the board too 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.120
 buy so I have the board at 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:44.130
 bought moreboards I link you the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.680
 Just go and the part is the one 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.150
 hammer I like to ride with such extreme 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.190
 Now I have to be careful that not that 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.810
 not here again 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.250
 In any case, I've got people over 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.180
 now also a live channel is therefore 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.800
 the live I will make videos 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.280
 so if this video here 15 yes ok 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.900
 15 likes cracks then comes the first 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.060
 video on my reallife channel and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.579
 Dannstadt that there also comes 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.310
 Incidentally, really really cool 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.799
 Design by a designer I will tell you 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.209
 In any case, when the design is done 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.729
 is to be linked 1000 times 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.320
 super super cool and I already have 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.220
 seen first pictures and sees that 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.840
 just so cool and yes as I said 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.990
 this is it is derwisch sammer 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.430
 looks cool from finished cool what do you want 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.790
 Because more say I would say people 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.650
 I did not have to be that extreme right now 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.340
 long is over it again because you 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.320
 probably already know something 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.690
 Longboard can and I just wanted 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.400
 only the word completely here 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.919
 and I would say that 's it 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.150
 Incidentally, he also writes people in 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.140
 the comments 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.330
 if you own a longboard on 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.940
 which brand you will have 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.550
 or if you 're a skateboarder waveboard 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.630
 or scooter or what do i know i would 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.020
 say it was people's skin in and ton 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.020
