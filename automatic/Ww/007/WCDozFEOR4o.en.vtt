00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.720
 the idea arose as a result of a need or 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.510
 of a concern on the part of my husband 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.210
 after I have worked a job 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.110
 in the administrative part of a chain 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.110
 of restaurants 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.320
 he has always had like that dream of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.509
 have as a type diner type usa in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 where people can come and buy 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.530
 tasty cheap tasty rich food is a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.890
 kind of fast food but not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.690
 necessarily fast food because the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 ingredients are fresh 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.589
 the idea is to build it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.700
 in front of people that you see that 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.520
 be nutritious that is not one because it is 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.690
 and industrial very very tasteless very without 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.320
 grace but it's very homemade food 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.130
 gourmet but at the same time accessible to 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.010
 public then 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:08.790
 to March of last year seeks the travel to 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 Miami and there in Miami I'm looking for work 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 He did not hesitate, nor did he know what he 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.530
 it was the customs people not even like 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 as' rate because it did not exist there was never 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.580
 entered the point here they have entered 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.870
 abyss type trucks that after here 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.670
 the 90s 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.040
 last year he had not yet entered 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.010
 I like it 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.650
 properly these weeks I did not know 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.300
 even how to hunt 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.150
 super interesting because the day that 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.160
 we went to pick up a customs 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.260
 it is an experience that all the people of 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.130
 the customs came out because they wanted to see it 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 inside 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 everyone was super intrigued that 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.650
 it was that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.900
 we started working with designers 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.100
 graphics come on let's work on the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.080
 web page 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.620
 We wanted to do things right at 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.780
 good principle 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.450
 instead, leaving wine was called 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.520
 trompoloco that will be the name that has 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.220
 in the USA not only as you want from the 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.900
 people who made Mexican food in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.810
 houston the key 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.489
 and then he's super nice because to scratch 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.959
 at the moment that the country that lives 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.720
 we started working on it 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.870
 For example, you saw the truck coming 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.329
 which has its own design 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.040
 we patented the idea and we patented in 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.859
 record what is the name of football 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.859
 then everything he ate from food
