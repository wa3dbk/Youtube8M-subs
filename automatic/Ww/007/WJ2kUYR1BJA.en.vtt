the way to the finals with that in mind

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.530 
the way to the finals with that in mind
and<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.560> stupid<00:02:04.820> came<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> job<00:02:06.300> got

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and it was stupid came up to the job got

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350 
and it was stupid came up to the job got
sideways<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:08.520> knew<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.940> went<00:02:09.119> around<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
sideways and I knew if I went around the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.560 
sideways and I knew if I went around the
jump<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:10.050> gonna<00:02:10.200> lose<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.880> went<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
jump I was gonna lose and I went for it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.120 
jump I was gonna lose and I went for it
anyway<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.320> know<00:02:13.350> knowing<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.800> I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
anyway and you know knowing that I

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.640 
anyway and you know knowing that I
really<00:02:14.760> didn't<00:02:15.690> enough<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.140> ever<00:02:16.320> needed

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
really didn't enough to the ever needed

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.590 
really didn't enough to the ever needed
your<00:02:16.800> head<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.880> definitely<00:02:18.209> took<00:02:18.540> a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
your head but you know definitely took a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.880 
your head but you know definitely took a
little<00:02:18.810> bit<00:02:18.959> more<00:02:19.110> risk<00:02:19.380> than<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.620> should<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
little bit more risk than I should it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:35.480 
little bit more risk than I should it
there

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.190 

but<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> competition<00:02:37.060> was<00:02:37.090> stepped<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:37.600> so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
but the competition was stepped up so

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.930 
but the competition was stepped up so
far<00:02:38.500> compared<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.010> last<00:02:39.160> time<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.550> had

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
far compared to the last time that I had

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.390 
far compared to the last time that I had
jumped<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:41.470> know<00:02:41.560> wasn't<00:02:41.920> wasn't<00:02:42.220> gonna

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
jumped that you know wasn't wasn't gonna

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.310 
jumped that you know wasn't wasn't gonna
be<00:02:42.550> easy<00:02:42.580> Matt<00:02:43.390> put<00:02:43.690> down<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> run<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.230> was

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
be easy Matt put down a run that was

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.800 
be easy Matt put down a run that was
just<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.980> was<00:02:45.130> ridiculous<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.510> think

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
just it was ridiculous and I think

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.320 
just it was ridiculous and I think
having<00:02:46.990> seen<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.470> run<00:02:47.680> really<00:02:48.520> made<00:02:48.670> myself

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
having seen that run really made myself

00:02:49.330 --> 00:03:13.690 
having seen that run really made myself
you<00:02:50.140> know<00:02:50.230> push<00:02:50.560> harder<00:02:51.190> than<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.910> needed<00:02:52.300> to

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.580 

injuries<00:03:15.190> they<00:03:16.540> put<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.870> perspective<00:03:18.410> you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
injuries they put you in perspective you

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.680 
injuries they put you in perspective you
know<00:03:18.800> it's<00:03:19.160> what<00:03:19.340> keeps<00:03:19.819> you<00:03:20.030> sane<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.510> keeps

you<00:03:20.810> from<00:03:21.050> you<00:03:21.620> know<00:03:21.709> really<00:03:22.190> doing<00:03:22.340> stuff

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
you from you know really doing stuff

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.550 
you from you know really doing stuff
that<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.030> above<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.420> beyond<00:03:23.750> your

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that it's above and beyond your

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.800 
that it's above and beyond your
possibility<00:03:25.100> but<00:03:25.240> at<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.330> same<00:03:26.450> time<00:03:26.630> that's

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
possibility but at the same time that's

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.210 
possibility but at the same time that's
what<00:03:26.930> makes<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.200> challenging<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.830> have<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.069> do

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
what makes it challenging you have to do

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.559 
what makes it challenging you have to do
as<00:03:28.370> much<00:03:28.550> as<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:28.760> can<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.090> be<00:03:29.180> right<00:03:29.360> on<00:03:29.390> that

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
as much as you can and be right on that

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.840 
as much as you can and be right on that
limit<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.590> limit<00:03:30.830> always<00:03:31.100> goes<00:03:31.580> further

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
limit and the limit always goes further

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.220 
limit and the limit always goes further
and<00:03:31.970> further<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.480> know<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.750> limit<00:03:32.990> one<00:03:33.110> day

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and further you know the limit one day

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.800 
and further you know the limit one day
is<00:03:33.290> not<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.560> limit<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.860> next<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:35.120> it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
is not the limit the next so it's it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.870 
is not the limit the next so it's it's
good<00:03:36.050> injuries<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.310> you're<00:03:37.490> scared<00:03:37.730> you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
good injuries if you're scared you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.699 
good injuries if you're scared you
shouldn't<00:03:38.120> be<00:03:38.209> out<00:03:38.360> there<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.990> know<00:03:39.590> for
