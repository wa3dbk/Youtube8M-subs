so the starting point for this

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.490 
so the starting point for this
collaboration<00:01:01.360> was<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.660> idea<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.020> Marla's

collaboration was the idea of Marla's

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.439 
collaboration was the idea of Marla's
first<00:01:02.920> symphony<00:01:03.190> which<00:01:03.610> were<00:01:03.760> playing<00:01:04.000> in<00:01:04.239> an

klezmer music in the second of their
movements<00:01:10.900> which<00:01:11.830> could<00:01:12.130> inspire<00:01:12.780> something

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
movements which could inspire something

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.270 
movements which could inspire something
else<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.170> concert<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.740> collaboration

between Shakira and the war well the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.410 
between Shakira and the war well the
decision<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.070> couple<00:01:18.430> Marla<00:01:19.000> with<00:01:19.119> klezmer

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.020 
decision to a couple Marla with klezmer
was<00:01:19.720> brilliant<00:01:20.409> one<00:01:20.530> because<00:01:20.860> Marla<00:01:21.310> Marla's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
was brilliant one because Marla Marla's

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.670 
was brilliant one because Marla Marla's
music<00:01:22.420> encompasses<00:01:23.050> so<00:01:23.259> many<00:01:23.440> different

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
music encompasses so many different

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.499 
music encompasses so many different
styles<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.280> particularly<00:01:24.880> first<00:01:25.270> symphony

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
styles and particularly first symphony

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.930 
styles and particularly first symphony
there's<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.470> good<00:01:26.680> deal<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:26.860> klezmer<00:01:27.220> music<00:01:27.399> and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
there's a good deal of klezmer music and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.840 
there's a good deal of klezmer music and
it's<00:01:28.720> been<00:01:28.930> much<00:01:29.110> talked<00:01:29.440> about<00:01:29.740> but<00:01:30.009> I'm<00:01:30.670> not

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
it's been much talked about but I'm not

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.760 
it's been much talked about but I'm not
sure<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.119> people<00:01:31.570> have<00:01:31.690> ever<00:01:31.840> really<00:01:32.050> put

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
sure that people have ever really put

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.889 
sure that people have ever really put
the<00:01:32.920> two<00:01:33.160> styles<00:01:33.580> side<00:01:33.789> by<00:01:33.940> side<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
the two styles side by side the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.400 
the two styles side by side the
techniques<00:01:35.740> which<00:01:36.690> clarinet<00:01:37.690> players<00:01:38.080> and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
techniques which clarinet players and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.690 
techniques which clarinet players and
klezmer<00:01:38.679> use<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.869> quite<00:01:41.229> different<00:01:41.800> specific

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
klezmer use are quite different specific

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.270 
klezmer use are quite different specific
techniques<00:01:43.210> than<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.810> lot<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.320> classical

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
techniques than a lot of classical

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.090 
techniques than a lot of classical
clarinet<00:01:45.789> players<00:01:46.090> are<00:01:46.420> used<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.259> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
clarinet players are used to the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.830 
clarinet players are used to the
clarinet<00:01:48.550> has<00:01:48.700> always<00:01:48.909> been<00:01:49.240> very<00:01:49.479> closely

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
clarinet has always been very closely

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.590 
clarinet has always been very closely
associated<00:01:50.409> with<00:01:50.679> vocal<00:01:51.550> music<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.090> singing

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
associated with vocal music and singing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.230 
associated with vocal music and singing
has<00:01:53.080> always<00:01:53.110> been<00:01:53.950> closely<00:01:54.280> associated<00:01:54.819> with

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
has always been closely associated with

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.600 
has always been closely associated with
the<00:01:55.450> clarinet<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.830> it's<00:01:57.130> really<00:01:57.399> interesting

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
the clarinet so it's really interesting

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.570 
the clarinet so it's really interesting
in<00:01:57.909> klezmer<00:01:58.149> how<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.720> tradition<00:01:59.289> is

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
in klezmer how that tradition is

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.859 
in klezmer how that tradition is
channeled<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.970> completely<00:02:01.330> different<00:02:01.539> way

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
channeled in a completely different way

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.809 
channeled in a completely different way
for<00:02:02.349> Mozart<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.009> clarinet<00:02:03.369> as<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.550> singing

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
for Mozart the clarinet as a singing

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.300 
for Mozart the clarinet as a singing
instrument<00:02:04.450> and<00:02:04.660> in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.869> same<00:02:05.050> way<00:02:05.289> even<00:02:06.099> now

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
instrument and in the same way even now

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.419 
instrument and in the same way even now
that<00:02:06.610> vocal<00:02:07.599> quality<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.229> still<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.800> clarinet

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
that vocal quality is still in clarinet

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.820 
that vocal quality is still in clarinet
klezmer<00:02:09.670> music<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.440> particularly<00:02:11.440> having<00:02:11.709> a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
klezmer music and particularly having a

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.380 
klezmer music and particularly having a
chamber<00:02:12.220> arrangement<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.760> Marla<00:02:13.120> makes

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
chamber arrangement of Marla makes

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.320 
chamber arrangement of Marla makes
probably<00:02:14.170> makes<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> klezmer<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.879> much<00:02:16.060> more

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
probably makes the klezmer so much more

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.070 
probably makes the klezmer so much more
apparent<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.200> much<00:02:17.500> more<00:02:17.770> stylistic<00:02:18.370> and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
apparent and much more stylistic and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.360 
apparent and much more stylistic and
hopefully<00:02:20.080> by<00:02:20.260> putting<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.950> two<00:02:21.099> styles

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
hopefully by putting the two styles

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.339 
hopefully by putting the two styles
immediately<00:02:22.030> next<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> each<00:02:22.450> other

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
immediately next to each other

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.860 
immediately next to each other
Marla's<00:02:24.010> music<00:02:24.340> will<00:02:24.489> become<00:02:24.819> much<00:02:25.239> more<00:02:25.540> kind

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
Marla's music will become much more kind

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.199 
Marla's music will become much more kind
of<00:02:25.989> alive<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.099> influences<00:02:27.550> become<00:02:27.879> much<00:02:28.030> more

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
of alive the influences become much more

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.170 
of alive the influences become much more

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
is that it might paint the mullet in a

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.820 
is that it might paint the mullet in a
slightly<00:03:25.180> different<00:03:25.450> light<00:03:25.960> to<00:03:26.500> be<00:03:26.620> able<00:03:26.650> to

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830
