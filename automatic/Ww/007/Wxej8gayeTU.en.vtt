there's our foil land nice we just play
aether<00:01:37.860> adept<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.910> in<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.240> mean<00:01:39.420> yeah

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bounce that yeah I guess we must and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.820 
bounce that yeah I guess we must and
then<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.700> he<00:01:44.820> plays<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.440> mere<00:01:46.440> increased<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.710> turn

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
then if he plays a mere increased a turn

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.020 
then if he plays a mere increased a turn
next<00:01:46.920> time<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.190> get<00:01:47.250> his<00:01:47.370> vapor<00:01:47.550> snug<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
next time we get his vapor snug that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
next time we get his vapor snug that
counted<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.660> back<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.620> way<00:01:49.770> we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
counted on the way back this way we

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.620 
counted on the way back this way we
start<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.550> know<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.970> beaten<00:01:51.330> him<00:01:51.450> down

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
start just you know get beaten him down

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.920 
start just you know get beaten him down
yet<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:52.350> mean<00:01:53.190> it's<00:01:53.460> probably<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.420> wait<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
yet I mean it's probably to wait with it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
yet I mean it's probably to wait with it
but<00:01:55.110> yeah<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> mean<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.620> not<00:01:55.830> mean<00:01:56.010> it's<00:01:56.280> good
