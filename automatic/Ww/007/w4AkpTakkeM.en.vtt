00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
might seem like our little critic is
growing<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.220> he<00:01:53.579> managed<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.240> round<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
growing up but he managed to round it
off<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.079> something<00:01:55.350> akin<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> video<00:01:56.790> games

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820

I'm not odd but I have never played a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.020 
I'm not odd but I have never played a
video<00:02:02.790> game<00:02:02.930> therefore<00:02:03.930> I

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.910 
especially as Easter eggs I think that
if<00:03:01.940> they<00:03:02.090> made<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.080> had<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.739> do<00:03:03.890> a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
lot in order to get it then it would

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.530 
lot in order to get it then it would
make<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:06.920> worth<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.519> would<00:03:07.640> be<00:03:07.790> like<00:03:07.970> okay

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540
