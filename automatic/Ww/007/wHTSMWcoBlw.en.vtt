to start by using an inkjet printer to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.690 
to start by using an inkjet printer to
put<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> chance<00:00:16.200> for<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.620> bottom<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> saw

put a chance for on the bottom now I saw
Steve<00:00:17.940> Ramsey<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> few<00:00:18.840> weeks<00:00:19.020> ago

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Steve Ramsey do this a few weeks ago

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.750 
Steve Ramsey do this a few weeks ago
that's<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.070> cool<00:00:20.190> and<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> thought

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that's just really cool and I thought

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.420 
that's just really cool and I thought
man<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.300> something<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.660> could<00:00:21.869> use<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.710> my

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
man that's something I could use so my

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.100 
man that's something I could use so my
kids<00:00:23.640> are<00:00:23.730> big<00:00:23.880> skaters<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.450> Walt<00:00:24.720> had<00:00:24.930> this

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
kids are big skaters and Walt had this

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.650 
kids are big skaters and Walt had this
blank<00:00:25.470> line<00:00:25.710> around<00:00:26.040> so<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> first<00:00:27.090> step<00:00:27.360> was

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
blank line around so the first step was

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.409 
blank line around so the first step was
to<00:00:27.740> sand<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.070> remove<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.849> finish<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
to sand and remove the finish the

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.410 
to sand and remove the finish the
existing<00:00:30.840> finish<00:00:31.200> because<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:32.610> ink<00:00:33.000> needs

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
existing finish because the ink needs

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.960 
existing finish because the ink needs
something<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.170> absorb<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
something to absorb into and the the

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.000 
something to absorb into and the the
bare<00:00:36.270> wood<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.720> perfect<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bare wood is perfect for that if you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
bare wood is perfect for that if you
were<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> try<00:00:38.400> to<00:00:38.460> put<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.880> transcript<00:00:39.360> right

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
were to try to put the transcript right

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
were to try to put the transcript right
on<00:00:39.870> top<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> finish<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> comes<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
on top of the finish that comes on the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
on top of the finish that comes on the
board<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.750> ink<00:00:42.930> wouldn't<00:00:43.230> dry<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.739> would

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
board the ink wouldn't dry and it would

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.979 
board the ink wouldn't dry and it would
just<00:00:44.010> smear<00:00:44.280> off<00:00:44.520> I've<00:00:45.120> already<00:00:45.390> sanded<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
just smear off I've already sanded the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.189 
just smear off I've already sanded the
board<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.680> used<00:00:46.859> 150<00:00:47.579> grit<00:00:47.730> sandpaper<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
board and I used 150 grit sandpaper in a

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.040 
board and I used 150 grit sandpaper in a
palm<00:00:49.440> sander<00:00:49.829> now<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.149> main<00:00:51.390> area<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
palm sander now the main area where the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.169 
palm sander now the main area where the
graphic<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.769> transfer<00:00:53.280> will<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.789> went

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
graphic or the transfer will go I went

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.150 
graphic or the transfer will go I went
through<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> finish<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.019> bare<00:00:55.260> wood<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.769> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
through the finish to bare wood and the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.900 
through the finish to bare wood and the
rest<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.579> board

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
rest of the board

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
rest of the board
I<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.210> scuffed<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I just scuffed up a little bit and that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
I just scuffed up a little bit and that
will<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> paint<00:00:59.579> stick<00:00:59.820> better<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.600> one

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
will make the paint stick better now one

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.209 
will make the paint stick better now one
of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.929> really<00:01:01.140> cool<00:01:01.289> things<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.649> graphic

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
of the really cool things about graphic

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.770 
of the really cool things about graphic
artists<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.940> generally<00:01:03.329> building<00:01:03.660> on

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
artists you're generally building on

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.299 
artists you're generally building on
something<00:01:04.170> else<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.620> you<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.010> Andy

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
something else so if you think of Andy

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
something else so if you think of Andy
Warhol<00:01:05.700> he<00:01:06.300> was<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.690> know<00:01:06.750> working<00:01:07.020> with

Warhol he was you know working with
Marilyn<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.740> maybe<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.370> Campbell<00:01:08.700> Soup<00:01:08.730> cans

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
Marilyn and maybe the Campbell Soup cans

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
Marilyn and maybe the Campbell Soup cans
and<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> skater<00:01:10.620> you've<00:01:10.920> probably

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and if you're a skater you've probably

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.569 
and if you're a skater you've probably
heard<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.790> obey<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.870> obey<00:01:13.350> company<00:01:13.890> well<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
heard of obey the obey company well that

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.090 
heard of obey the obey company well that
image<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.390> Andre<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> Giant<00:01:16.770> who<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> a

professional wrestler and the artist
Shepard<00:01:19.530> Fairey<00:01:19.950> basically<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.909> took<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Shepard Fairey basically just took a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.929 
Shepard Fairey basically just took a
photograph<00:01:21.329> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.290> an<00:01:23.159> advertisement

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
photograph I think of an advertisement

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
photograph I think of an advertisement
in<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> magazine<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:25.829> what<00:01:25.979> I'm<00:01:26.070> doing

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
in a magazine so that's what I'm doing

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.090 
in a magazine so that's what I'm doing
here<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.049> an<00:01:28.049> oxygen<00:01:28.500> mask<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:28.979> say

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
here this is an oxygen mask I would say

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.179 
here this is an oxygen mask I would say
this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.310> probably<00:01:29.369> world<00:01:30.119> war<00:01:30.299> ii<00:01:30.509> era<00:01:31.189> 1940s

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
this is probably world war ii era 1940s

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
this is probably world war ii era 1940s
oxygen<00:01:32.670> mask<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> i<00:01:33.600> found<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.930> box<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
oxygen mask and i found this box a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.480 
oxygen mask and i found this box a
couple<00:01:34.530> years<00:01:34.710> ago<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> since<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.340> I've

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
couple years ago and since then I've

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
couple years ago and since then I've
made<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> shirt<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.299> couple<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> other<00:01:36.750> things

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
made the shirt a couple of other things

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.569 
made the shirt a couple of other things
and<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.890> why<00:01:37.979> I'm<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.219> use<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and that's why I'm going to use for the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.080 
and that's why I'm going to use for the
bottom<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.969> skateboard<00:01:43.700> I've<00:01:44.700> trimmed<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
bottom of the skateboard I've trimmed a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.969 
bottom of the skateboard I've trimmed a
little<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> excess<00:01:45.899> paper<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.860> will

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
little of the excess paper and that will

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.499 
little of the excess paper and that will
make<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> easier<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> place<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> image<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
make it easier to place the image on the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.280 
make it easier to place the image on the
skateboard

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
skateboard

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.709 
skateboard
you<00:01:49.860> only<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.219> one<00:01:50.399> shot<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.909> place<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.570> image

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
you only get one shot to place the image

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.740 
you only get one shot to place the image
on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.500> surface<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> image

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
on the surface so I have the image

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
on the surface so I have the image
facing<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> ink<00:01:56.340> doesn't

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549

facing up right now and the ink doesn't
dry<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.030> fast<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.539> have<00:01:57.630> plenty<00:01:57.899> time<00:01:58.079> to

dry very fast so you have plenty time to
work<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:59.310> I'm<00:01:59.399> putting<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> few<00:01:59.939> pieces<00:02:00.090> of
