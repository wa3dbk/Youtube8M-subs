they<00:00:52.649> had<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.039> rewrite<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> program<00:00:54.239> or

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they had to rewrite the program or

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
they had to rewrite the program or
reorient<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> very<00:00:56.850> brothers

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
reorient it because it is very brothers

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
reorient it because it is very brothers
as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> horizontal<00:00:58.920> game<00:00:59.160> but

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
as you know was a horizontal game but

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
as you know was a horizontal game but
they<00:00:59.879> wanted<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> able<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> orient<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
they wanted to be able to orient it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
they wanted to be able to orient it
better<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> vertical<00:01:02.340> screen<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> guess

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
better for a vertical screen so I guess

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.690 
better for a vertical screen so I guess
it's<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.339> movies

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's kind of like what they do to movies

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
it's kind of like what they do to movies
sometimes<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.360> TV<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> stretch<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
sometimes on TV they kind of stretch the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.950 
sometimes on TV they kind of stretch the
picture<00:01:08.100> book<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> other<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
picture book in the other way but what a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.590 
picture book in the other way but what a
great<00:01:10.229> combination<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:11.100> games<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.390> put

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
great combination of games and they put

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
great combination of games and they put
it<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> regular<00:01:13.200> coin<00:01:13.439> door<00:01:13.710> rather<00:01:13.950> than

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it in a regular coin door rather than

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.810 
it in a regular coin door rather than
that<00:01:14.310> large<00:01:14.610> black<00:01:14.970> door<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:16.820> Nintendo

originally<00:01:18.270> had<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.720> always

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
originally had that was always

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
originally had that was always
problematic<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> touch<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.590> start

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
problematic so when you touch the start

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
problematic so when you touch the start
button<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.580> free<00:01:23.759> play<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:25.080> can
