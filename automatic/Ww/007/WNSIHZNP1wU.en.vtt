00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.300 
distance from the car prob about 300
yards<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.569> we<00:01:35.259> are<00:01:35.439> getting<00:01:35.649> into<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:36.009> brush

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
yards and we are getting into the brush

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.789 
yards and we are getting into the brush
here<00:01:36.750> before<00:01:37.750> coming<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.109> we<00:01:38.229> took<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.439> look<00:01:38.619> at

here before coming out we took a look at

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.440 
here before coming out we took a look at
expert<00:01:39.159> GPS<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:39.969> show<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.329> there

weren't any real travel lines there any
paths<00:01:43.240> around<00:01:43.509> here<00:01:43.929> so<00:01:44.409> we're<00:01:44.500> going<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.709> go

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
paths around here so we're going to go

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.289 
paths around here so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:44.979> start<00:01:45.250> bushwhacking<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.119> pretty

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.690 
ahead and start bushwhacking and pretty
much<00:01:46.360> what<00:01:46.630> bushwhacking<00:01:47.289> is<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.739> going<00:01:48.520> into

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
much what bushwhacking is is going into

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.580 
much what bushwhacking is is going into
the<00:01:48.789> brush<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.420> going<00:01:49.840> over<00:01:49.989> brush<00:01:50.289> through

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:00.619 
the brush and going over brush through
brush<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.420> finding<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.539> cash<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.709> let's<00:01:53.890> go

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:00.629 

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:03.300 

well<00:02:01.629> we've<00:02:01.810> gotten<00:02:02.079> within<00:02:02.229> about<00:02:02.530> 30<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.009> 40

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
well we've gotten within about 30 to 40

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.179 
well we've gotten within about 30 to 40
feet<00:02:03.340> from<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:03.909> as<00:02:04.030> per<00:02:04.239> what<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.539> gps<00:02:04.719> says<00:02:05.379> so

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
feet from it as per what the gps says so

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.709 
feet from it as per what the gps says so
we<00:02:06.520> have<00:02:06.610> this<00:02:06.729> vast<00:02:07.090> area<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.509> we're<00:02:07.629> going

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
we have this vast area that we're going

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.839 
we have this vast area that we're going
to<00:02:07.780> start<00:02:07.959> looking<00:02:08.170> at<00:02:08.530> at<00:02:08.769> most<00:02:09.310> low<00:02:09.549> brush

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
to start looking at at most low brush

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.380 
to start looking at at most low brush
areas<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.530> we<00:02:12.459> start<00:02:13.060> looking<00:02:13.120> at<00:02:13.329> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
areas like this we start looking at the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.150 
areas like this we start looking at the
base<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.840> trees<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.440> go<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:14.950> from<00:02:14.980> there

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
base of the trees and go up from there

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.699 
base of the trees and go up from there
this<00:02:15.970> geocaching<00:02:16.600> container<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.200> website

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
this geocaching container on the website

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.009 
this geocaching container on the website
showed<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> large<00:02:19.060> or<00:02:20.700> regular<00:02:21.700> sized

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
showed to be a large or regular sized

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.150 
showed to be a large or regular sized
geocache<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.290> should<00:02:23.440> be<00:02:23.470> pretty<00:02:23.590> easy<00:02:23.859> to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
geocache so it should be pretty easy to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.069
