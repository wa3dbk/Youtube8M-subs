in<00:00:05.360> the<00:00:06.050> previous<00:00:06.350> two<00:00:06.590> examples<00:00:06.620> we<00:00:07.310> used

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
in the previous two examples we used

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.910 
in the previous two examples we used
some<00:00:07.700> sonic<00:00:07.970> snapshots<00:00:08.690> to<00:00:08.960> label<00:00:09.440> the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
some sonic snapshots to label the

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.090 
some sonic snapshots to label the
harmonic<00:00:10.430> sound<00:00:10.790> of<00:00:11.150> a<00:00:11.540> move<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.619> first<00:00:12.889> one

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
harmonic sound of a move the first one

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.810 
harmonic sound of a move the first one
was<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.520> B<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.809> the<00:00:14.840> C<00:00:14.990> and<00:00:15.500> we<00:00:16.070> kept<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.520> C

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
was the B to the C and we kept the C

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.760 
was the B to the C and we kept the C
into<00:00:17.029> base<00:00:17.240> or<00:00:17.690> it<00:00:17.960> could<00:00:18.080> just<00:00:18.230> approach<00:00:18.560> from

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
into base or it could just approach from

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.150 
into base or it could just approach from
a<00:00:18.860> half<00:00:19.039> step<00:00:19.250> blowing<00:00:19.640> in<00:00:19.789> jailhouse<00:00:20.180> rock

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
a half step blowing in jailhouse rock

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.470 
a half step blowing in jailhouse rock
what<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:22.190> want<00:00:22.370> you<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.490> do<00:00:22.610> is<00:00:22.730> look<00:00:22.880> at<00:00:23.000> diagram

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
what I want you to do is look at diagram

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.300 
what I want you to do is look at diagram
one<00:00:23.750> now<00:00:23.990> I've<00:00:24.080> had<00:00:24.260> that<00:00:24.410> diagram<00:00:24.830> up<00:00:25.070> for<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
one now I've had that diagram up for the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.590 
one now I've had that diagram up for the
previous<00:00:25.640> two<00:00:25.790> lessons<00:00:25.970> now<00:00:26.360> you're<00:00:26.510> gonna

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
previous two lessons now you're gonna

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.200 
previous two lessons now you're gonna
see<00:00:26.990> where<00:00:27.260> that's<00:00:27.380> coming<00:00:27.710> from<00:00:28.180> you<00:00:29.180> can

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
see where that's coming from you can

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.080 
see where that's coming from you can
clearly<00:00:29.660> see<00:00:29.810> in<00:00:30.140> diagram<00:00:30.560> one<00:00:30.950> that<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.820> have

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
clearly see in diagram one that you have

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.630 
clearly see in diagram one that you have
some<00:00:32.480> notes<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:33.079> would<00:00:33.590> form<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.070> B<00:00:34.309> chord

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
some notes that would form this B chord

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.850 
some notes that would form this B chord
now<00:00:35.360> remember<00:00:35.809> that<00:00:35.840> these<00:00:36.079> numbers<00:00:36.410> are

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
now remember that these numbers are

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.360 
now remember that these numbers are
aligned<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:37.640> C<00:00:38.090> being<00:00:38.420> one<00:00:38.750> if<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:40.070> look<00:00:40.250> at

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
aligned to C being one if you look at

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.639 
aligned to C being one if you look at
the<00:00:40.460> red<00:00:40.670> notes<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.210> red<00:00:41.450> notes<00:00:41.720> would<00:00:41.900> be<00:00:41.960> the

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
the red notes the red notes would be the

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.280 
the red notes the red notes would be the
notes<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.160> our<00:00:43.370> C<00:00:43.610> arpeggios<00:00:44.270> C<00:00:44.540> is<00:00:44.690> one<00:00:44.960> he<00:00:45.260> is

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
notes in our C arpeggios C is one he is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.310 
notes in our C arpeggios C is one he is
three<00:00:45.829> G<00:00:46.130> is<00:00:46.280> 5<00:00:46.550> then<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.880> starts<00:00:47.180> over<00:00:47.329> again<00:00:47.480> C

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
three G is 5 then it starts over again C

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.549 
three G is 5 then it starts over again C
is<00:00:48.440> 1<00:00:48.739> B<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:49.280> 3<00:00:49.670> G<00:00:49.970> is<00:00:50.090> 5<00:00:50.360> what<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:51.110> just<00:00:51.380> played

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
is 1 B is 3 G is 5 what I just played

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.130 
is 1 B is 3 G is 5 what I just played
was<00:00:51.920> example<00:00:52.460> one<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.910> your<00:00:53.059> tablature<00:00:53.630> you

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
was example one of your tablature you

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.979 
was example one of your tablature you
see<00:00:54.410> 8th<00:00:55.010> fret<00:00:55.370> seventh<00:00:55.880> fret<00:00:55.910> fifth<00:00:56.450> fifth

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
see 8th fret seventh fret fifth fifth

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.860 
see 8th fret seventh fret fifth fifth
third<00:00:57.910> now<00:00:58.910> there<00:00:59.030> are<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.120> lot<00:00:59.239> of<00:00:59.270> anger<00:00:59.809> is

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
third now there are a lot of anger is

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.660 
third now there are a lot of anger is
you<00:01:00.020> could<00:01:00.170> use<00:01:00.380> there<00:01:00.649> that's<00:01:01.160> not<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.489> big

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
you could use there that's not the big

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.860 
you could use there that's not the big
issue<00:01:01.850> right<00:01:02.000> now<00:01:02.270> because<00:01:02.450> we're<00:01:02.629> gonna<00:01:02.719> be

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
issue right now because we're gonna be

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.289 
issue right now because we're gonna be
kind<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.350> open<00:01:03.500> minded<00:01:03.950> about<00:01:04.070> fingerings<00:01:04.670> but

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
kind of open minded about fingerings but

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.149 
kind of open minded about fingerings but
out<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.689> that<00:01:05.899> you<00:01:06.079> would<00:01:06.229> see<00:01:06.439> all<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.710> these

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
out of that you would see all of these

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.669 
out of that you would see all of these
different<00:01:07.219> groups<00:01:07.939> of<00:01:08.210> notes<00:01:08.899> which<00:01:09.499> would

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
different groups of notes which would

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.620 
different groups of notes which would
constitute<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:10.280> C<00:01:10.520> chord<00:01:10.759> if<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.420> play

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
constitute a C chord if you play

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.599 
constitute a C chord if you play
adjacent<00:01:12.350> three<00:01:12.590> note<00:01:12.770> groups<00:01:13.069> you'll<00:01:13.399> have<00:01:13.579> a

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
adjacent three note groups you'll have a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.749 
adjacent three note groups you'll have a
complete<00:01:14.060> C<00:01:14.329> try<00:01:14.630> on<00:01:14.829> okay<00:01:15.829> just<00:01:16.369> for<00:01:16.490> theory

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
complete C try on okay just for theory

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.160 
complete C try on okay just for theory
purposes<00:01:17.179> if<00:01:17.329> you<00:01:17.420> play<00:01:17.569> these<00:01:17.749> bottom<00:01:18.139> three

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
purposes if you play these bottom three

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.739 
purposes if you play these bottom three
notes<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.340> got<00:01:19.520> c<00:01:19.759> e<00:01:19.789> g<00:01:19.999> that's<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.569> root

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
notes you got c e g that's a root

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.809 
notes you got c e g that's a root
position<00:01:20.899> try<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.499> if<00:01:21.829> you<00:01:22.130> play<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.549> next

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
position try it if you play the next

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.749 
position try it if you play the next
three<00:01:23.090> meaning<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.810> fifth<00:01:24.049> fourth<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.499> third

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
three meaning the fifth fourth and third

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.309 
three meaning the fifth fourth and third
you've<00:01:25.759> got<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:25.969> first<00:01:26.299> inversion<00:01:26.630> c<00:01:27.020> try<00:01:27.259> it

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
you've got a first inversion c try it

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.539 
you've got a first inversion c try it
because<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.649> third<00:01:27.859> the<00:01:28.039> cord<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.429> in<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
because the third the cord is in the

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.910 
because the third the cord is in the
base<00:01:28.639> then<00:01:29.420> if<00:01:29.509> you<00:01:29.600> play<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.990> next<00:01:30.170> three<00:01:30.619> the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
base then if you play the next three the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.469 
base then if you play the next three the
fourth<00:01:31.279> third<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.579> second<00:01:32.029> strings<00:01:32.299> you've

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
fourth third and second strings you've

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.300 
fourth third and second strings you've
got<00:01:32.600> your<00:01:32.749> second<00:01:33.109> inversion<00:01:33.380> C<00:01:33.740> triad<00:01:34.069> with

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
got your second inversion C triad with

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.160 
got your second inversion C triad with
the<00:01:34.429> fifth<00:01:34.639> the<00:01:34.789> base<00:01:34.969> then<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.479> starts<00:01:35.869> over

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
the fifth the base then it starts over

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.169 
the fifth the base then it starts over
again<00:01:36.279> with<00:01:37.279> your<00:01:37.399> C<00:01:37.609> chord<00:01:37.819> in<00:01:37.969> root<00:01:37.999> position

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
again with your C chord in root position

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.989 
again with your C chord in root position
C<00:01:38.599> e<00:01:38.840> G<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.829> that's<00:01:39.889> just<00:01:40.099> a<00:01:40.219> little<00:01:40.429> theory<00:01:40.849> and

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
C e G so that's just a little theory and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.550 
C e G so that's just a little theory and
I've<00:01:41.389> mentioned<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.899> in<00:01:42.109> a<00:01:42.200> lot<00:01:42.349> of<00:01:42.380> my

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
I've mentioned this in a lot of my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.989 
I've mentioned this in a lot of my
lessons<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.039> want<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.579> you're<00:01:43.670> playing

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
lessons you want to when you're playing

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.399 
lessons you want to when you're playing
you<00:01:44.240> want<00:01:44.389> to<00:01:44.450> make<00:01:44.569> sure<00:01:44.599> you<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:44.990> see<00:01:45.200> any

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
you want to make sure you can see any

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.929 
you want to make sure you can see any
kind<00:01:45.679> of<00:01:45.740> combination<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.459> these<00:01:46.609> notes

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
kind of combination of these notes

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.519 
kind of combination of these notes
because<00:01:47.569> it's<00:01:47.659> all<00:01:47.749> gonna<00:01:47.869> be<00:01:48.049> very<00:01:48.289> relevant

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
because it's all gonna be very relevant

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.230 
because it's all gonna be very relevant
to<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.889> C<00:01:49.069> chord<00:01:49.249> obviously<00:01:49.849> these<00:01:50.029> are<00:01:50.209> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
to a C chord obviously these are the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120 
to a C chord obviously these are the
notes<00:01:50.479> in<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.749> C<00:01:50.899> chord<00:01:51.229> all<00:01:51.709> right<00:01:51.889> so<00:01:52.009> in

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
notes in the C chord all right so in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.129 
notes in the C chord all right so in
diagram<00:01:52.520> one<00:01:52.880> those<00:01:53.149> red<00:01:53.479> notes<00:01:53.749> are<00:01:53.929> what<00:01:54.020> we

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:54.139 
diagram one those red notes are what we

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:55.989 
diagram one those red notes are what we
were<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:54.319> dealing<00:01:54.560> with<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.279> one<00:01:55.579> note<00:01:55.819> per

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
were just dealing with that one note per

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.959 
were just dealing with that one note per

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
root okay so in Lesson one you learned

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.539 
root okay so in Lesson one you learned
your<00:02:05.419> Zorba<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.840> Greek<00:02:06.079> move<00:02:06.469> which<00:02:07.099> amounted

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
your Zorba the Greek move which amounted

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.279 
your Zorba the Greek move which amounted
to<00:02:07.609> approaching<00:02:08.209> from<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.630> half<00:02:08.869> step<00:02:09.140> below

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
to approaching from a half step below

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.750 
to approaching from a half step below
our<00:02:10.000> chords<00:02:11.000> were<00:02:11.150> B<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.780> C<00:02:12.380> B<00:02:12.980> was<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> seven

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
our chords were B and C B was a seven

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.190 
our chords were B and C B was a seven
major<00:02:14.000> that's<00:02:14.360> why<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:14.570> use<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> uppercase

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
major that's why we use the uppercase

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.640 
major that's why we use the uppercase
Roman<00:02:15.620> numeral<00:02:16.010> that's<00:02:16.490> not<00:02:16.790> diet

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
Roman numeral that's not diet

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.369 
Roman numeral that's not diet
and<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.799> key<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.459> we've<00:02:19.239> got<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.750> couple<00:02:20.230> of

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
and the key is it we've got a couple of

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.710 
and the key is it we've got a couple of
wrong<00:02:20.590> notes<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.159> this<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.879> B<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> C

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
wrong notes in this the B is in the C

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.990 
wrong notes in this the B is in the C
scale<00:02:23.049> but<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.129> other<00:02:24.280> two<00:02:24.489> notes<00:02:24.730> aren't

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
scale but the other two notes aren't

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600 
scale but the other two notes aren't
okay<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:25.810> let's<00:02:26.140> look<00:02:26.290> back<00:02:26.500> here<00:02:26.860> if<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.459> look

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
okay so let's look back here if you look

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.759 
okay so let's look back here if you look
at<00:02:27.730> diagram<00:02:28.209> one<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.780> will<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.560> red

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
at diagram one you will see that the red

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.039 
at diagram one you will see that the red
notes<00:02:30.069> are<00:02:30.370> what<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.209> stopped<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:31.930> like

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
notes are what you stopped on just like

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.080 
notes are what you stopped on just like
a<00:02:32.080> red<00:02:32.799> light<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:33.159> you<00:02:33.310> mean<00:02:33.519> stop<00:02:33.790> when<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
a red light as you mean stop when you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240 
a red light as you mean stop when you
come<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.329> to<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.480> red<00:02:34.659> light<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.110> our<00:02:35.620> whole<00:02:35.950> goal

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
come up to a red light so our whole goal

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.640 
come up to a red light so our whole goal
here<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.730> always<00:02:37.180> target<00:02:37.810> chord<00:02:38.140> tones<00:02:38.409> at

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
here is to always target chord tones at

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.440 
here is to always target chord tones at
the<00:02:38.769> end<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.159> whatever<00:02:39.340> riff<00:02:39.849> we<00:02:40.060> play<00:02:40.299> or

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the end of whatever riff we play or

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
the end of whatever riff we play or
whatever<00:02:40.599> melodic<00:02:41.079> pattern<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.709> you're

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
whatever melodic pattern and you're

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.610 
whatever melodic pattern and you're
gonna<00:02:42.790> learn<00:02:43.060> these<00:02:43.299> step-by-step<00:02:43.720> looking

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
gonna learn these step-by-step looking

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.140 
gonna learn these step-by-step looking
at<00:02:44.739> lower<00:02:44.950> neighbors<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.579> upper<00:02:45.849> neighbors

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
at lower neighbors and upper neighbors

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.240 
at lower neighbors and upper neighbors
but<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.450> point<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.349> you<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:47.950> one

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
but the point is that you have this one

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.880 
but the point is that you have this one
note<00:02:48.459> per<00:02:48.489> string<00:02:48.720> arpeggio<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.379> can<00:02:50.590> see

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
note per string arpeggio and you can see

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.780 
note per string arpeggio and you can see
in<00:02:51.160> diagram<00:02:51.609> one<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.269> B<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.079> C<00:02:53.410> move<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.099> if

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
in diagram one a B to a C move and if

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.580 
in diagram one a B to a C move and if
you<00:02:54.879> look<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.299> upper<00:02:55.480> notes<00:02:56.049> you'll<00:02:56.379> see

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you look at the upper notes you'll see

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.770 
you look at the upper notes you'll see
that<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.829> forms<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.220> D<00:02:57.370> minor<00:02:57.609> chord<00:02:57.780> here's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
that it forms a D minor chord here's

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.690 
that it forms a D minor chord here's
your<00:02:58.930> D<00:02:59.049> minor<00:02:59.319> chord<00:02:59.440> record<00:03:00.310> fifth<00:03:00.519> string

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
your D minor chord record fifth string

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.509 
your D minor chord record fifth string
root<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:01.120> minor<00:03:01.510> form<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.769> see<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.250> right

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
root a minor form you can see that right

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.530 
root a minor form you can see that right
in<00:03:03.700> diagram<00:03:04.060> one<00:03:04.450> here<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> 6<00:03:05.319> to<00:03:05.620> 4<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:07.030> 6

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.660 
in diagram one here is a 6 to 4 and a 6
now<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.440> might<00:03:08.650> suddenly<00:03:09.069> arrives<00:03:09.549> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
now you might suddenly arrives a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.860 
now you might suddenly arrives a
question<00:03:10.030> here<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.329> might<00:03:10.480> say<00:03:10.659> wait<00:03:10.840> a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
question here you might say wait a

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.190 
question here you might say wait a
minute

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
minute

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.170 
minute
I<00:03:11.290> thought<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.890> minor<00:03:12.190> chord<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.609> root<00:03:12.940> a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
I thought a minor chord is a root a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.599 
I thought a minor chord is a root a
flatted<00:03:13.750> third<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.140> fifth

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
flatted third and a fifth

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.860 
flatted third and a fifth
remember<00:03:15.609> that<00:03:15.790> everything<00:03:16.329> we're<00:03:16.480> gonna<00:03:16.569> do

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
remember that everything we're gonna do

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.990 
remember that everything we're gonna do
will<00:03:17.260> be<00:03:17.409> in<00:03:17.530> terms<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.129> sea<00:03:18.190> route<00:03:18.790> so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
will be in terms of a sea route so

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.309 
will be in terms of a sea route so
that's<00:03:19.150> why<00:03:19.299> we're<00:03:19.480> numbering<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.140> way

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
that's why we're numbering it that way

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.110 
that's why we're numbering it that way
this<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.829> gonna<00:03:21.040> pay<00:03:21.310> off<00:03:21.340> because<00:03:21.970> you'll

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
this is gonna pay off because you'll

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.870 
this is gonna pay off because you'll
always<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.450> targeting<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.989> 1<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.410> 3<00:03:23.440> or<00:03:23.739> 5<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.700> all

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
always be targeting a 1 a 3 or 5 so all

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.240 
always be targeting a 1 a 3 or 5 so all
I<00:03:24.910> want<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.359> do<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:26.230> practice<00:03:26.470> example
