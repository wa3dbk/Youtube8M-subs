00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.889 

I<00:00:01.949> think<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:02.760> big<00:00:02.909> victory<00:00:03.270> isn't<00:00:03.389> always

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
I think the big victory isn't always

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.690 
I think the big victory isn't always
important<00:00:04.230> thing<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.589> think<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.160> important

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
important thing I think the important

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.909 
important thing I think the important
thing<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.379> image<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.410> gave<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.770> ourselves

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
thing is the image you gave of ourselves

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.530 
thing is the image you gave of ourselves
I<00:00:08.309> think<00:00:08.340> that's<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.970> most<00:00:09.090> people<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.450> then

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I think that's the most people and then

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.570 
I think that's the most people and then
like<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.719> said<00:00:09.870> before<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.349> coach<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.099> said<00:00:11.400> as

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
like I said before the coach and said as

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.770 
like I said before the coach and said as
well<00:00:12.110> it<00:00:13.110> was<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> complete<00:00:13.769> performance

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
well it was a complete performance

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.120 
well it was a complete performance
important<00:00:15.780> thing<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.650> got<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:16.980> good

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
important thing is that we got that good

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.769 
important thing is that we got that good
feeling<00:00:17.279> back<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:17.820> played<00:00:17.850> really<00:00:18.150> well

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.070 

we<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:21.810> know<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.529> Leo<00:00:23.900> I'm<00:00:24.900> very

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
we all know what we have in Leo I'm very

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.920 
we all know what we have in Leo I'm very
happy<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.439> I'm<00:00:25.650> pretty<00:00:26.070> grateful<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:27.689> being

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
happy and I'm pretty grateful to being

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
happy and I'm pretty grateful to being
the<00:00:27.990> same<00:00:28.109> person<00:00:28.140> he<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.560> him<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.970> thank<00:00:29.970> him

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the same person he was him and thank him

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.549 
the same person he was him and thank him
for<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.390> pass<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.779> goal<00:00:33.230> it's<00:00:34.230> difficult<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
for this pass my goal it's difficult to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.530 
for this pass my goal it's difficult to
be<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.340> change<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
be a because it's a change I think in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.940 
be a because it's a change I think in
each<00:00:37.079> team<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> play<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.800> bit

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
each team you play a little bit

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.979 
each team you play a little bit
differently<00:00:38.250> each<00:00:39.180> coach<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:39.809> their<00:00:39.960> own

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
differently each coach has their own

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.069 
differently each coach has their own
ideas<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:42.059> understands<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.989> their

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
ideas and it understands things in their

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.029 
ideas and it understands things in their
own<00:00:43.170> way<00:00:43.350> they're<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.430> same<00:00:45.530> but<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.680> think

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
own way they're not the same but I think

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
own way they're not the same but I think
I've<00:00:47.190> had<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.579> look<00:00:48.149> really<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I've had a bit of look really because I

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.049 
I've had a bit of look really because I
had<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> coach<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.770> severe<00:00:50.250> own<00:00:50.460> IM<00:00:50.730> buddy<00:00:50.910> who

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
had a coach in severe own IM buddy who

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
had a coach in severe own IM buddy who
has<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.960> similar<00:00:52.079> idea<00:00:52.590> very<00:00:52.890> similar

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
has a very similar idea very similar

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
has a very similar idea very similar
philosophy<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:55.610> think<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> surely<00:00:57.120> has

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
philosophy I think that surely has

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.790 
philosophy I think that surely has
helped<00:00:57.420> me<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:58.559> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> keep<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.280> I<00:01:00.800> know

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
helped me I just want to keep on I know

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
helped me I just want to keep on I know
I've<00:01:02.129> been<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.460> another<00:01:02.550> tale<00:01:02.910> there's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I've been just another tale there's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.960 
I've been just another tale there's
still<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> long<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.199> long<00:01:04.439> way<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.970> I'm

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
still a long time a long way to go I'm

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.539 
still a long time a long way to go I'm
not<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.420> carried<00:01:06.750> away<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> think

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
not going to get carried away so I think

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.980 
not going to get carried away so I think
there's<00:01:08.909> still<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> long<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> learn<00:01:09.720> lots

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
there's still a long way to learn lots

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
there's still a long way to learn lots
of<00:01:10.110> work<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.280> could<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.520> go

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of work to do now we could just go

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
of work to do now we could just go
prepare<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> next<00:01:12.180> game<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.070> never

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
prepare the next game that you can never

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.880 
prepare the next game that you can never
expect<00:01:18.350> innovation<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> go<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
expect innovation when you go off the

field<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.680> want<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
field like that you don't really want to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
field like that you don't really want to
think<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:24.330> whether<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> might<00:01:25.140> happen

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
think about that whether it might happen

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.850
