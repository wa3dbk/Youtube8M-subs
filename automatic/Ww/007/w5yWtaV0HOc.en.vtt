retirement<00:00:45.030> he's<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.170> man<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.710> think<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
retirement he's our man I think this is

retirement he's our man I think this is
a<00:00:47.730> great<00:00:48.000> move<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> Dolphins<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> totally

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a great move by the Dolphins I totally

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.389 
a great move by the Dolphins I totally
agree<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.629> gives<00:00:51.930> him<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.530> chance<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
agree with it it gives him a chance to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.049 
agree with it it gives him a chance to
relax<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.629> play<00:00:55.469> his<00:00:55.739> game<00:00:56.010> he<00:00:56.730> knows

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
relax and just play his game he knows

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.869 
relax and just play his game he knows
he's<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.750> man<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.829> gonna<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.670> also

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
he's the man it's gonna I think also

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.209 
he's the man it's gonna I think also
bring<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.480> better<00:01:00.809> bleeder<00:01:01.260> ship<00:01:01.559> qualities

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
bring out better bleeder ship qualities

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.000 
bring out better bleeder ship qualities
in<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.879> he<00:01:03.180> knows<00:01:03.449> he's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> man<00:01:04.559> he's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
in it because he knows he's the man he's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
in it because he knows he's the man he's
got<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> step<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.260> i<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:08.340> mean<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> wide

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
got to step it up i I mean with a wide

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.620 
got to step it up i I mean with a wide
receiver<00:01:09.810> unit<00:01:10.080> while<00:01:10.890> very<00:01:11.310> young<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:11.909> think

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
receiver unit while very young i think

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.890 
receiver unit while very young i think
is<00:01:12.869> very<00:01:12.950> quality<00:01:13.950> being<00:01:14.220> put<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.780> next<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> him

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
is very quality being put up next to him

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
is very quality being put up next to him
so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.090> him<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.619> mean<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so it's time for him to go I mean it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.880 
so it's time for him to go I mean it's
time<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
time for him to get this thing going and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.330 
time for him to get this thing going and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.230 
lead us to the playoffs that schedule is
still<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> problem<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> don't<00:01:30.030> know

believe<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> Dolphins<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.670> get

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
believe that the Dolphins if they get

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.330 
believe that the Dolphins if they get
off<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> great<00:01:36.450> start<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:37.500> gain<00:01:37.950> some

off to a great start will gain some

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
off to a great start will gain some
