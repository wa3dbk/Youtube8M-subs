 Pack ice sticks but a cell phone if you already knew that percent reached for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 the band 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.190
 good for any surprise 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.830
 musically rousing with records of real life 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 it cools 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.030
 musical influences of every color abound

 St 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 and they could 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 maybe two or maybe it's for them sometimes too 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670
 Torture produced 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.860
 pretty satisfied cooperative climate why 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.380
 to 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.400
 was cooked 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.700
 These fears after a year founded youth group 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.250
 the district court Siegen was the goal 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.030
 Low German texts for the High German grew up the challenge 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.930
 if the idea is faster than Low German 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.130
 He receives then he often leaves his discreet as later 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.550
 the book of the artist is said to be the most well-trained 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.960
 Church musician singer and pianist 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.780
 at the center of the protests 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.620
 Furthermore, 7,000 kilometers per hour are reached from Ahrensburg 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.530
 the stately Siegener 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.109
 Fallada when I had the idea of â€‹â€‹flapping pop music 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.409
 but first of all people wanted to play really many concerts 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.610
 and can also make friends with the Low German Manthey and then 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.260
 can stand fully in the juice 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.330
 and found them so quickly by now 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.370
 Live together in the village in addition to district festivals or large stages 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.720
 make music directly to the audience that they love 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.570
 The first CD they have done anyway Sven Bender had said it 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.570
 stage 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.250

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.090
 did not make it 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.119
 Hermann Leistner 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:38.009
 new-isenburg man and the children vaccinated there comes as a place is still one 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:42.629
 higher 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.499
 I have whoever more complaints even though the band member is there 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.429
