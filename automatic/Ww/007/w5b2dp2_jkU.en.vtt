00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
month if that were the full moon and we

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.480 
month if that were the full moon and we
had<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:07.930> on<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.440> full<00:01:08.650> moon<00:01:08.680> how<00:01:09.430> do

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
had to have it on the full moon how do

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.060 
had to have it on the full moon how do
you<00:01:09.700> find<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.330> full<00:01:10.600> moon<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:11.409> full<00:01:11.650> moon<00:01:11.680> is

a<00:01:12.130> mathematical<00:01:12.490> moment<00:01:13.450> in<00:01:13.570> time<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.229> this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
a mathematical moment in time and this

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.740 
a mathematical moment in time and this
is<00:01:14.890> not<00:01:15.100> what<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.610> scripture<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.210> talking
