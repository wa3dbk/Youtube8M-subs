already<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> trailer<00:00:28.199> from<00:00:28.439> Ground<00:00:28.769> Zero

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
already the trailer from Ground Zero

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.040 
already the trailer from Ground Zero
that<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.490> showed<00:00:29.730> last<00:00:30.060> year<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that this showed last year and the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.370 
that this showed last year and the
trailers<00:00:31.859> showed<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.270> VJs<00:00:33.660> they're<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
trailers showed and the VJs they're the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680 
trailers showed and the VJs they're the
same<00:00:34.620> game<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.520> don't<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> title<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
same game so I don't think the title of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
same game so I don't think the title of
Ground<00:00:36.989> Zero<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.440> any<00:00:37.739> real<00:00:38.309> title<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
Ground Zero is any real title I think it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.400 
Ground Zero is any real title I think it
was<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> practiced<00:00:39.690> how<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
was like a practiced how they want to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.650 
was like a practiced how they want to

somehow major 0 was somehow involved

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
somehow major 0 was somehow involved
because<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.430> believe<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> point<00:01:21.509> in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
because I believe he at this point in

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
because I believe he at this point in
time<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:22.530> would<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> only<00:01:23.189> person<00:01:23.790> who

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
time he would be the only person who

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.289 
time he would be the only person who
could<00:01:24.270> incorporate<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.960> military<00:01:25.409> strike<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
could incorporate a military strike of

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.319 
could incorporate a military strike of
that<00:01:27.299> type<00:01:28.310> really<00:01:29.310> against<00:01:29.700> big<00:01:29.850> boss<00:01:30.060> since

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
he would know his tactics and he would

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
he would know his tactics and he would
actually<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:32.939> some<00:01:33.659> motivation<00:01:33.869> for

that's<00:02:26.980> possible<00:02:27.580> idea<00:02:28.110> one<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> biggest

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
that's possible idea one of the biggest

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.530 
that's possible idea one of the biggest
surprises<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.790> trailer<00:02:31.060> showed<00:02:31.300> is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
surprises that this trailer showed is

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.500 
surprises that this trailer showed is
this<00:02:31.960> guy<00:02:32.170> here<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.340> may<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.640> wrong<00:02:34.030> no

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
this guy here and I may be wrong no

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.940 
this guy here and I may be wrong no
one's<00:02:34.690> confirmed<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.260> or<00:02:35.380> not<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.830> believe

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
one's confirmed it or not but I believe

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.820 
one's confirmed it or not but I believe
this<00:02:36.400> could<00:02:36.640> be<00:02:36.700> Ocelot<00:02:37.450> yeah<00:02:38.350> revolver

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
this could be Ocelot yeah revolver

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.300 
this could be Ocelot yeah revolver
ocelot<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:40.120> makes<00:02:40.840> general<00:02:41.200> sense<00:02:41.590> because<00:02:42.070> at

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
ocelot it makes general sense because at

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.400 
ocelot it makes general sense because at
this<00:02:42.610> point<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:42.940> time<00:02:43.120> philosophy<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.230> don't

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
this point in time philosophy you don't

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.340 
this point in time philosophy you don't
know<00:02:44.530> Ocelot<00:02:45.160> admired<00:02:45.820> big<00:02:46.330> boss<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.110> makes

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
know Ocelot admired big boss so it makes

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.410 
know Ocelot admired big boss so it makes
sense<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.560> he<00:02:47.740> want<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.160> help<00:02:48.520> him<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
sense that he want to help him and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.270 
sense that he want to help him and
although<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.810> can't<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.470> did<00:02:50.680> was<00:02:50.860> not<00:02:51.010> able<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
although I can't I did was not able to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.880 
although I can't I did was not able to
get<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.610> good<00:02:52.060> picture<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.020> but<00:02:53.290> if<00:02:53.680> you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
get a good picture of this but if you

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.890 
get a good picture of this but if you
actually<00:02:54.070> watch<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.970> trail<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.480> look<00:02:55.720> at

reproject took place in 1972 would
you<00:04:26.560> know<00:04:26.680> was<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.070> cloning<00:04:27.760> project<00:04:28.270> for<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
you know was the cloning project for the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.020 
you know was the cloning project for the
creation<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.170> solid<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:29.890> liquid<00:04:29.950> snake<00:04:30.670> and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
creation of solid and liquid snake and

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.010 
creation of solid and liquid snake and
the<00:04:31.810> peace<00:04:32.080> walker<00:04:32.350> incident<00:04:32.890> took<00:04:32.980> place<00:04:33.040> in

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the peace walker incident took place in

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.010 
the peace walker incident took place in
1974<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.050> at<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.650> time<00:04:36.450> liquid<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.600> solid

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
1974 so at that time liquid and solid

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.370 
1974 so at that time liquid and solid
were<00:04:38.230> um<00:04:38.470> two<00:04:38.980> years<00:04:39.010> old<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.120> although<00:04:41.050> they

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
were um two years old and although they

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.960 
were um two years old and although they
have<00:04:41.410> not<00:04:41.770> confirmed<00:04:41.920> exactly<00:04:42.280> what<00:04:42.790> year

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
have not confirmed exactly what year

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.240 
have not confirmed exactly what year
that<00:04:43.120> this<00:04:43.270> game<00:04:43.480> takes<00:04:43.720> place<00:04:43.960> its<00:04:44.950> carrier

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
that this game takes place its carrier

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.190 
that this game takes place its carrier
takes<00:04:45.520> place<00:04:45.730> sometime<00:04:46.300> after<00:04:46.750> her<00:04:46.810> peace

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
takes place sometime after her peace

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.770 
takes place sometime after her peace
walker<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:47.950> my<00:04:48.520> best<00:04:48.820> guess<00:04:49.030> is<00:04:49.060> maybe<00:04:49.450> a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
walker so my best guess is maybe a

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.580 
walker so my best guess is maybe a
couple<00:04:50.380> months<00:04:50.620> after<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.190> or<00:04:52.020> 1975<00:04:53.020> maybe<00:04:53.440> it

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
couple months after it or 1975 maybe it

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.770 
couple months after it or 1975 maybe it
was<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.800> good<00:04:54.220> date<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:55.150> when<00:04:55.300> he<00:04:55.390> wakes<00:04:55.540> and

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
was a good date and when he wakes and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.690 
was a good date and when he wakes and
when<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.050> big<00:04:56.380> bust<00:04:56.620> wakes<00:04:56.860> up<00:04:57.040> from<00:04:57.160> his<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.400> coma

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
when a big bust wakes up from his a coma

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.520 
when a big bust wakes up from his a coma
in<00:04:57.820> which<00:04:57.970> you<00:04:58.060> seen<00:04:58.330> him<00:04:58.540> as<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:59.320> know<00:04:59.350> his

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
in which you seen him as a you know his

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.670 
in which you seen him as a you know his
arm<00:04:59.860> is<00:05:00.130> gone<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:01.030> doctor<00:05:01.510> who<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.230> believe<00:05:02.560> the

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
arm is gone the doctor who I believe the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.960 
arm is gone the doctor who I believe the
character<00:05:02.980> from<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.190> original<00:05:03.640> Metal<00:05:03.880> Gear

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
nine years which would mean that during

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.660 
nine years which would mean that during
the<00:05:11.050> hospital<00:05:11.680> scene<00:05:11.920> it<00:05:12.160> would<00:05:12.340> have<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.640> be
