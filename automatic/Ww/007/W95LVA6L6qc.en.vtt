00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi to all if you are looking at this 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.060
 video is because you are interested in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.520
 make the very famous drop-shaped buttonhole 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.430
 which is realized along the beam for 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.980
 connect for example a terminal in 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:22.710
 this one this side or it is cut 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 to realize for example suffered or for 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.609
 tie us a totanara then binding 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 pitto tanaro more love or more tataki a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:39.620
 depending on the use to make it yes 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:44.820
 proceed in this way the yarn is doubled 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.690
 realizing this circle then we pass 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:58.100
 to carry out three or four turns with 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.100
 these two declines with these two parts 123 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.700
 4 the circle is stretched with the two averages 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.740
 for convenience then then between this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.520
 space is passed the part 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.660
 lower than the circle one is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.660
 previously realized 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.850
 in this way 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.850
 and finally we move on to tighten the knot 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.930
 therefore it does not want on a beam if it is 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.220
 can achieve more than 16 as you wish 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.640
 procedure is always the same as is done 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:48.170
 naked holding it with indexes and yes 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:53.290
 make the coils in this way yes 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.290
 it passes and it tightens the whole thing 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.860
 therefore as said they can also be 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.520
 cut the known will also be cut 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 more down 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.140
 here it is
