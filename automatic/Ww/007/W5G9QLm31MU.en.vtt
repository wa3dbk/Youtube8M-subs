in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> game<00:00:57.059> which<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.719> gotta<00:00:57.930> admit

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
in the game which I gotta admit

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.510 
in the game which I gotta admit
surprises<00:00:59.160> me

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
surprises me

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
surprises me
I<00:00:59.550> thought<00:01:00.180> dome<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> smallest<00:01:01.350> map

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I thought dome was the smallest map

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
I thought dome was the smallest map
because<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> simplistic<00:01:02.699> layout<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
because of the simplistic layout but I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
because of the simplistic layout but I
guess<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.229> wrong<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:05.040> reading<00:01:05.489> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
guess I was wrong I'm reading this

hat is physically the smallest map in
the<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:09.990> surprised<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the game and I'm surprised because the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
the game and I'm surprised because the
map<00:01:11.189> doesn't<00:01:11.430> play<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.810> pace

map doesn't play like it is the pace

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.770 
map doesn't play like it is the pace
fast<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.860> course<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> royal<00:01:15.210> cluster

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
fast of course but is it a royal cluster

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800 
fast of course but is it a royal cluster
like<00:01:16.470> rust<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.159> nuketown<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:18.000> black<00:01:18.210> ops<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
like rust or nuketown from black ops I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.410 
like rust or nuketown from black ops I
say<00:01:19.350> no<00:01:19.619> maybe<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.939> me

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
say no maybe that's just me

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.690 
say no maybe that's just me
anyway<00:01:21.990> let's<00:01:22.409> move<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.100> keep<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.520> on

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
anyway let's move on to keep up on

good all-purpose weapon the map features

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
good all-purpose weapon the map features
mostly<00:01:29.040> close<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.549> medium<00:01:29.729> range<00:01:29.909> combat<00:01:30.659> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
mostly close to medium range combat so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.319 
mostly close to medium range combat so

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
on the salt rifle SMG or machine pistol
makes<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> most<00:01:33.900> sense<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.130> these

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
makes the most sense all of these

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
makes the most sense all of these
weapons<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.850> handle<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> kind<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.659> fight

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
weapons can handle the kind of fight

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
weapons can handle the kind of fight
you'll<00:01:37.020> encounter<00:01:37.320> hardhat<00:01:38.130> constantly

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you'll encounter hardhat constantly

switches from close to medium range

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
switches from close to medium range
fight<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.130> need<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> primary<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.180> can

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
fight so you need a primary that can

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
fight so you need a primary that can
handle<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.899> various<00:01:43.170> battles<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:44.130> be

you can guess the tunnel is a hot route
