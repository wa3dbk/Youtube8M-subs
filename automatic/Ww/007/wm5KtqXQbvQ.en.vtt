00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.140
 good here we have a jeep compass 2007 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.470
 7 in the bin 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.380
 contained in the manual but unfortunately 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.530
 take online 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.810
 and that has to send to Europe is a 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.390
 93 176 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.390
 then we put them online but let's go 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.650
 well here we are with the dj pro as 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.290
 We said the tacho gives us the facility 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.350
 than send them online in this type of 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.490
 car 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.910
 there is no ease we are going to look for chip 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.400
 we have alpha 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.320
 bryant chevrolet crisis train 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.320
 grace leave 2 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.430
 ford gm holden wave hammer script 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.970
 infinity your jeep 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.650
 let's go to the chip 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.650
 this is a compass 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.090
 we can do it via hebrón or via 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.899
 diagnosis that is via vd 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.600
 let's go to the agnostic transport is the 16 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.659
 What is it 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.460
 the lobe we have here the mileage 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.460
 what's on the girl where are they 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.810
 we have it 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.840
 139 1790 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.100
 why 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 then we give it 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.030
 okay 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.950
 there is a reading we can hundred between 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.939
 1760 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.939
 98 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.890
 you are reading the eye as I said is 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.569
 this reader is online 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.630
 but we can be video you can insert 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.060
 the board 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.750
 when he has 139 thousand 792 of the machine and 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.830
 here says 139 thousand seven hundred ninety 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.830
 how much you want 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.300
 then here we put 60 there 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.159
 4000 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.160
 eye we go back to repeat the old one has 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:56.920
 139 1790 diagnostic path 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:01.260
 we go back to review almost 110 1790 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.260
 we give it simply ok 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.360
 let's see the board 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.360
 to 104 thousand 699 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.459
 here says flechado 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.600
 there I wanted what I wanted but for a 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.590
 kilometer bar is no longer not accurate to say 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.120
 let's reject the value 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.120
 here compass 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.900
 and diagnosis 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.410
 16 ok that 's where he starts reading the 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.410
 binary codes 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.390
 and I repeat again this is done via 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.720
 on-line 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:54.630
 it is not done via online track reading 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.630
 but with how to serve vd 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.600
 is reading all the ebro readings 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.459
 of 24,100 it is true that it says 64,100 but 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.550
 here appears 64 1099 now if you 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.630
 can move we are going to do a test 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.880
 Clear the client does not want that but 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.540
 let's put another let's put 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.540
 hundred 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.590
 110,000 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.200
 we are going to give him ok let's see the board 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.890
 how to flash I will move the camera to 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.890
 see on the board 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.039
 they realized 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.840
 now let's return it to what the 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.770
 customer wanted 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.770
 but the jeep 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:54.469
 but the work is really yes with the 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.849
 presence in 30 seconds of the hand and 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.849
 neither box hug silver 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.170
 compass 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.270
 here we are not talking about 34 minutes 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.030
 to demonstrate the video 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.020
 when I wanted 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.020
 let's read 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.780
 let's put 5 401 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.840
 when 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.530
 to italy in the mileage 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.279
 as the highest mileage goes to 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:37.990
 start brother 110,000 always by 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:43.800
 one never different you want 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:46.190
 64 then let's put one more 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.849
 6 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:56.139
 42 51 64 51 also then pérez 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.139
 I'm good at it 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.070
 but surely a world 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:08.070
 500 you want when you want 4 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.070
 500 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:17.000
 501 we are going to lose 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.249
 there we have 64 thousand 501 we are going to give him ok 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.359
 but let's see also 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.359
 now another panorama 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.580
 does not waver 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:32.780
 64,500 500 500 for 1 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.889
 christian black valdez to serve you 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.639
 anything 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.639
 they see me
