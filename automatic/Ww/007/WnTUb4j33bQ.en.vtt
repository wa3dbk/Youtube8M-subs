 for the library Red 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.500
 then let's pretend that these agents make bamboo fibers 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 drive in color 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.090
 the change does not happen again and again 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.920
 and then he probably will not reintroduce Arnim 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 easier for bankers 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.860
 it could be done too 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.000
 the house could actually continue 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.370
 since she left small

 make it very clear that he still so small and also have that I'm quite good 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.299
 let's do it as long as we park 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.480
 I mean why

 Gang like the others 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.990
 so I thought so next to such a small group g 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 7 percent is enough 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.319
 May not bother 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.139
 it works 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.589
 so 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.339
 8 red

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.019
 and then again not percent that were about to collect such 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 to then make it with the gear to 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.629

 square shapes absurd shapes we did not go along 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.229
 Of course we can also simply demanded in a square that the federal government already
