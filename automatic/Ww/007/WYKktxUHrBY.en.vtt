00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.750
 [Music] 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.090
 could here 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.650
 What is that thing for the legend 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.650
 his ground 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.810
 the pointless 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.970
 let's go live 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.020
 she wanted it that way 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.020
 stay with the wall for years 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.560
 bet 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.950
 now it is only as it was 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.950
 captured 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.239
 we flee this time you are holding 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.920
 German all like to search 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.070
 We already caught with us 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.070
 have to 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.350
 was that really a bring in the end 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.550
 his days 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.550
 we better get on our way 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:14.670
 Here we have to go 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.670
 The dragon destroys the fortress 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.390
 I'm on rides did you hear that? 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.690
 Mental storm maybe let her along 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.690
 to talk 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.300
 [Music] 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.910
 deserves the cause but is persistent 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.360
 What are you doing? We have to get out of here 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.460
 Heroes immediately store this Imperial 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.460
 We will need drinks 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.569
 [Music] 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:37.820
 [Music] 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:40.730
 And finally the torture chamber commutes her 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.830
 Just come in time for this 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.560
 boys seemed a little upset 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.979
 to be about the way I am 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.750
 have entertained your mates know 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:56.930
 you do not even know what's going on 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:58.780
 Please do not use a dragon against concord 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.240
 with such a nonsense 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.340
 although if I think about it 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.870
 I hear strange noises from over there 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.650
 heard and with us we have to get out of here 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.090
 nothing to say here 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.560
 Did not you hear me ? I said that 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.290
 fortress is attacked 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.380
 forget the old man I accompany 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.380
 you 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.970
 Where is the output has fallen 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.850
 This way we should lead the word 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.850
 better try this way 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.129
 that will live through me to him 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.150
 forgive 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.660
 Stop directly for us is uncertain 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.660
 you see her 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.969
 I want to lie with that one now 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.319
 not to the 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.349
 we can not pass her by 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:43.589
 always sneak slowly and what 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:46.729
 where on I go before big 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:46.729
 follow and cover 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.540
 it looks again like a lot already a 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.050
 to doubt if that ever will succeed 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.050
 would
