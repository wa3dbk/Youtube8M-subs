00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 door folding the problem with the solution 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.010
 and also see partitions with door 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 Today 's tip is defective. 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 do not bugger 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.619
 the folding door and brightness of your 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.590
 home is by everyday use 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 inevitably a problem will happen 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.160
 seriously here on this top rail 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.160
 What 's going to happen? 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 she is very thin she will break 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.190
 so that these screws 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.190
 fixing the head of a kayak 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.469
 Gabriela, she's going to have a child. 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.079
 door will fall 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.910
 here people do not sell this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.379
 ask separately this face here 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.719
 then it already shows anxiety that will be 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.160
 a solution that could solve this 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.989
 problem 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 Do you remember a long time ago? 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.549
 post a video on how to make doors 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.619
 or sliding partitions of pvs with 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.340
 very fragile solution and I found that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.369
 protect the car from direct action of the sun 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.250
 it was from there that came this idea of 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.570
 do this repair in a folding door 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.939
 so on the occasion that I did that route 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 had done only two is time of 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.770
 opening then I decide then make a 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 third it was in this third one that I found 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 that the solution to solve the problem 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 of the folding doors had 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.729
 placed is two child fixed on the face of the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.460
 with you are seeing here and 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.290
 I chose to boot a third door that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.909
 did not have space on one side of the wood 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.619
 neither of the other then I decided to put 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.100
 here is is aquino in this part of the wood 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.070
 on the bottom 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.350
 so in this work here because people 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.659
 saw the solution to the problem bet was 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.750
 nothing then the process is basically the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.350
 You 'll even make the one that ends here. 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.870
 in the pvc fixing pipe 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.950
 excellency with screws catching here 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.800
 inside will leave some previously ready 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.820
 in order to facilitate at the time of 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.100
 fixing the barrel 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.600
 then this face may be smaller than 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.210
 This one is putting a bet on this one. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.800
 baked then it might be that no more 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.800
 we feel it is enough 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.820
 after being removed to its folding door 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.270
 bathroom and have installed there is there is a 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.630
 our improvised box will do 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:00.530
 that alignment of the screws will 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.530
 be in the box on it in pvc pipe 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.690
 this way here 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.440
 think was was placed 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.440
 once a blog friend asked if 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.800
 was in a position to make a 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.160
 purchase of these folding door I said 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.260
 that the problem would be to find a team in 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.030
 new physical to hold three or more 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.580
 four doors so I think with this 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.310
 system if you choose to make a 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.390
 partition is buying several door 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.780
 then I think with this 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.299
 system here it will be possible to do this 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.380
 that several doors and make 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.270
 a partition to leave the finish is 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.640
 in that cane you do not want him to stay 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.710
 this color and the gray that does not really have 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.140
 nothing to see if it may be highlighting him 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.400
 and painting it with white spray paint 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:37.890
 is not this the tip will take the arms with 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.890
 God, everything is good
