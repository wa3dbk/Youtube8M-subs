00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.100
 hello youtube and welcome to my 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.680
 chain then today I would like 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.470
 make a very short video 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.330
 it's in response to a question that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 keeps coming back at the sales level 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.220
 well I'm going to make a video on the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 ballistic so at the level of the 22 long 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 rifle I am regularly asked if we 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.880
 tell me it's a little played is what 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's really effective 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.880
 yes free is really very very 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.940
 widely effective is to say also 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.379
 effective than 50 shepherd caliber since 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.840
 it's the same job it's the result 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.680
 is the same you are dead so yes 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.190
 it's effective 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.649
 we are not talking about passing a bullet 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.050
 a parent etc the wildlife is not talking 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.030
 to attack a leclerc tank we talk about 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 defense talks about hunting so yes the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.019
 22 long rifle very effective no it's 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 not a toy so I would just like to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.330
 talk about the psychological impact 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.700
 weapons so stop focusing 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.600
 on the image that gives a weapon 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.940
 in fact it's simple but if I 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.580
 address you with an opinion 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.620
 you almost have to smile 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.440
 when the opinel brings it back to the knife 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.330
 two big fathers with sees the pp who 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.990
 make sausage in the field with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.390
 the small the small baker of redhead 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.580
 it kills an opinel that kills as well as a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.890
 broken and cat and quinquas tote or this 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.210
 what you want is a piece you 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.570
 will be well cut in point which 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 cut so it does the job 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.140
 if I attack you with a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.790
 butterfly knife butterfly knife him 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.200
 there he has rather this negative image of 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.520
 gangsters let's say so here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.830
 the same if I attack you with a sword 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.400
 a medieval sword 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.100
 still it will cost will cut that 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.310
 an image the sword to the an outdated image 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.770
 in fact this finished that time there it is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.530
 it's all effective if I attack you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.780
 with a machete 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.459
 there you go a little more afraid 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.010
 why because the machete actually 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.780
 she gives off an image 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.829
 of settlement of accounts as the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.370
 massacre in Rwanda or things like 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.280
 so that's actually a question 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.439
 Image 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 when you defend yourself if you 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.590
 defend 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.019
 no matter what you do 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.319
 defend there is an image that retransmits 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.720
 if you have a bombshell 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.620
 teargas 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.090
 they are also called bombs of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.260
 defense and it's very rare 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.750
 excessively rare that it is used 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.639
 for the attack so automatically 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.139
 when you use this loan a spread 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.519
 defense 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.950
 you put in the defensive position 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.760
 so in the position of victim 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.150
 automatically so you your morale 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.680
 will be defensive with an object like this 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.269
 you will be more defensive than on 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.049
 the attack 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.200
 remember that the best defense is 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:23.060
 attacked your your opponent him 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.139
 are worth without even thinking it's 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.609
 the unconscious is going to be it all 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.680
 immediately in position of superiority 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.419
 since he's the one on the initiative he's the one who 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.690
 attack and you defend yourself with that 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:39.440
 so it's the victims who are defending themselves 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.250
 if I show you that the little one 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:49.250
 grandfather's rifle yes it does more 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:53.580
 or less scary good so that's it if I you 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.780
 show that if I get there 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.840
 if you show that right now 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.640
 you are no longer impressed by his 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.980
 why it's exactly the same 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.830
 town the result will be the same 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.680
 knew she said m a 22nd a caliber 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.660
 12 in the torso or in the head the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.670
 result will be the same 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.380
 it will make no difference but why 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.080
 because it's bigger than that 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.180
 more noise 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.560
 and here it is simple but I 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.150
 want for proof is that this is a 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.320
 semi automatic believe me in the army 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.320
 that's what we use semi 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.480
 automatic and without stopping without stopping 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.040
 all the time I'm asked and shot at 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.970
 pump 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.190
 but why because it's the image 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.560
 that's the image that's got of it 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.350
 in fact so stop turning on 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.280
 the image that emanates from a weapon is rather 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.950
 about its real usefulness and this to his 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.420
 real potential 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.130
 so that was just to give back 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.220
 this little global idea 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.440
 so stop asking me if the 22 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.540
 are effective yes it's 5 56 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.380
 agree like the famas like the m16 cdu 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.130
 5.56 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.830
 it's the same caliber we developed the 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.650
 22nd step compared to 5 56 by 45 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.419
 but we developed the 5 56 by 15 to 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.350
 through the sale of lots rifle before 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.919
 okay so that means we took 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:31.890
 this model agreement to develop the 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:34.980
 caliber that will guide the m16 the famas while 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.560
 that and if it was equipped with assault rifles 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.510
 this caliber is not for nothing it's 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.630
 because they encompass this caliber one 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.729
 penetration ability an index of 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.780
 penetration who is who who is crazy 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.570
 it is she salutes if not this thing and it is 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.700
 extremely powerful so yes the 22 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.920
 long rifle it's very very effective no 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.430
 it's not replayed 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.010
 trust me, it's difficult 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.320
 it's almost impossible to perform 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.530
 a shot at this distance but you 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.530
 would have hit in the head a 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.400
 guy at 800 m with a 22 long rifle the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:16.790
 folk or chain here is yes the 22 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.240
 long rifle his features it's very 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.810
 effective 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.310
 we can go up to 400 m we will say 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.740
 with a good 22 a good glasses and 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.500
 good conditions 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.930
 you are overlooking the target being in 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.910
 below and you have no wind 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.050
 ok it's nice humidity 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:38.030
 correct you can go up to 400 m 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.210
 with a 22 there is no problem and 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.000
 you will type a sheet without worry 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:48.230
 at 200 m a medium shooter grouped in 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.220
 its with a medium rifle bezel 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.150
 average and ammunition mean 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.700
 okay he goes group and I say no 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.740
 stevie wonder will not do it but 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.740
 so good go to next two videos
