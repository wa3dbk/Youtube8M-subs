we can I think we should have socialized
medicine<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.790> I<00:00:45.940> think<00:00:46.150> we<00:00:46.210> should<00:00:46.360> go<00:00:46.480> ahead

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
medicine and I think we should go ahead

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
thing to say in all of human history and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.570 
thing to say in all of human history and
we<00:02:59.960> should<00:03:00.020> all<00:03:00.290> every<00:03:00.710> one<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:01.010> us<00:03:01.100> listen<00:03:01.490> to

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
we should all every one of us listen to

we should all every one of us listen to
it<00:03:01.700> quick<00:03:01.940> or<00:03:02.180> we'll<00:03:02.600> be<00:03:02.750> kicking<00:03:02.960> ourselves

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
it quick or we'll be kicking ourselves

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.080 
it quick or we'll be kicking ourselves
for<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.680> rest<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.980> human<00:03:04.280> history<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.730> think<00:03:05.000> if

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.520

about<00:03:06.710> First<00:03:06.980> Amendment<00:03:07.400> rights<00:03:07.610> they

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
about First Amendment rights they

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.370 
about First Amendment rights they
probably<00:03:08.390> don't<00:03:08.600> understand<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.170> First

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.040

Amendment<00:03:12.170> rights<00:03:12.590> they<00:03:13.040> should<00:03:13.070> go<00:03:13.340> back<00:03:13.520> and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
Amendment rights they should go back and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.280 
Amendment rights they should go back and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
read the whole amendment I think pot

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.140 
read the whole amendment I think pot
should<00:03:15.530> be<00:03:15.650> legalized<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.370> think<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> solution

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
should be legalized I think the solution

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.240

to<00:03:17.360> serious<00:03:17.810> sex<00:03:18.050> offenders<00:03:18.470> probably<00:03:18.980> isn't

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.430 
to serious sex offenders probably isn't
registration<00:03:19.910> or<00:03:20.120> even<00:03:20.390> prison<00:03:20.810> it's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
registration or even prison it's

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.650 
registration or even prison it's
castration<00:03:22.160> or<00:03:22.340> execution<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.330> think

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
castration or execution I think

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.840 
castration or execution I think
cap-and-trade<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.500> horrible<00:03:24.920> idea<00:03:25.070> it

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
cap-and-trade is a horrible idea it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.550 
cap-and-trade is a horrible idea it

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.540 
Hansen's 100% dividend or fight I think

be the greatest threat this country has

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.960 
be the greatest threat this country has
ever<00:03:39.230> known<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:40.010> think<00:03:40.340> we<00:03:40.430> shouldn't<00:03:40.700> remove

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
ever known I think we shouldn't remove

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.340

any of the dams from the Pacific

Northwest<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:43.370> salmon<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:43.910> aren't<00:03:44.150> worth

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
Northwest the salmon just aren't worth

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.480 
Northwest the salmon just aren't worth
it<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.630> think<00:03:45.020> before<00:03:45.140> any<00:03:45.530> US<00:03:45.830> citizen<00:03:46.100> can

it I think before any US citizen can

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.310 
it I think before any US citizen can
