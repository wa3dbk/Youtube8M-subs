00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
called Noir it allows you to add

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.919 
called Noir it allows you to add
vignettes<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:14.880> some<00:00:15.059> color<00:00:15.269> processing

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
vignettes and do some color processing

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.050 
vignettes and do some color processing
to<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.350> images<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.310> without<00:00:17.520> further<00:00:17.699> ado

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
to your images so without further ado

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.300 
to your images so without further ado
let's<00:00:18.480> look<00:00:18.660> at<00:00:18.810> new<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.199> Noir<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> an

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
let's look at new our Noir is an

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.380 
let's look at new our Noir is an
application<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.880> allows<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> add

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
application that allows you to add

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
application that allows you to add
vignettes<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.199> color<00:00:22.800> tones<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.340> your<00:00:23.460> image

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
vignettes and color tones to your image

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460 
vignettes and color tones to your image
so<00:00:24.119> when<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> open<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.869> opens<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
so when you open it it opens with the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.320 
so when you open it it opens with the
last<00:00:25.680> image<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.640> working<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
last image that you are working on and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.759 
last image that you are working on and
so<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> picture<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> downtown<00:00:28.380> Phoenix

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
so this is a picture of downtown Phoenix

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.640 
so this is a picture of downtown Phoenix
so<00:00:29.369> what<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> there's<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.650> icon

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
so what I can do is there's this icon

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.020 
so what I can do is there's this icon
right<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.250> allows<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> open

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
right here and that allows you to open

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.030 
right here and that allows you to open
the<00:00:33.360> photo<00:00:33.570> library<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> glitches

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the photo library one of the glitches

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680 
the photo library one of the glitches
though<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.510> working

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
though is that if you're working

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.959 
though is that if you're working
horizontally<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.649> photos<00:00:37.950> open<00:00:38.370> vertically

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
horizontally the photos open vertically

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
horizontally the photos open vertically
so<00:00:39.690> hopefully<00:00:40.020> they'll<00:00:40.200> fix<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
so hopefully they'll fix that in the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.170 
so hopefully they'll fix that in the
future<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> my

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
future so I'm going to go in here to my

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.660 
future so I'm going to go in here to my
camera<00:00:42.600> roll<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> scroll<00:00:44.430> up

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
camera roll and I'm going to scroll up

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
camera roll and I'm going to scroll up
and<00:00:44.940> grab<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> photo<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.050> friend<00:00:46.320> Craig

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
and grab a photo of my friend Craig

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
and grab a photo of my friend Craig
because<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.340> sort<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> pick<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.120> them

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
because I sort of like to pick on them

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
because I sort of like to pick on them
so<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> once<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
so what we can do here is once we get a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
so what we can do here is once we get a
photo<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.780> use<00:00:51.899> any<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> these

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
photo in we can use any one of these

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
photo in we can use any one of these
presets<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> choose<00:00:54.120> one

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
presets so I'm just going to choose one

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
presets so I'm just going to choose one
of<00:00:54.360> these<00:00:54.480> presets<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> does

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
of these presets here and what it does

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
of these presets here and what it does
is<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> puts<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> vignette<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.930> color<00:00:58.260> tone

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
is it puts a vignette and a color tone

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
is it puts a vignette and a color tone
and<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.399> click<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.539> adjust<00:01:00.989> where<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and if I click I can adjust where the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.130 
and if I click I can adjust where the
vignette<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.219> being<00:01:02.699> placed<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> image<00:01:03.989> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
vignette is being placed on the image I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
vignette is being placed on the image I
can<00:01:04.290> move<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.530> around<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> larger

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
can move it around I can make it larger

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.590 
can move it around I can make it larger
or<00:01:06.270> smaller<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.040> always<00:01:08.220> sort<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> skew

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
or smaller and I can always sort of skew

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
or smaller and I can always sort of skew
this<00:01:09.780> around<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.380> nice<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.920> I've<00:01:10.979> got

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
this around it's really nice so I've got

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.160 
this around it's really nice so I've got
these<00:01:11.250> control<00:01:11.700> points<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.049> do

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
these control points here so I can do

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
these control points here so I can do
that<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.950> other<00:01:14.100> thing<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that the other thing I can do here is I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.749 
that the other thing I can do here is I
can<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> built-in<00:01:16.380> presets<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
can use one of the built-in presets and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
can use one of the built-in presets and
so<00:01:17.939> these<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.330> left<00:01:18.630> hand<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.110> so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so these are on the left hand side so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
so these are on the left hand side so
here's<00:01:19.710> sort<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> gradient<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:20.670> left<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
here's sort of a gradient from left to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.080 
here's sort of a gradient from left to
right<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.900> looks<00:01:22.110> pretty<00:01:22.170> cool<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
right it looks pretty cool I can do a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.890 
right it looks pretty cool I can do a
gradient<00:01:25.250> horizontally<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.240> darker<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
gradient horizontally so it's darker and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.410 
gradient horizontally so it's darker and
brighter<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.710> put<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> vignette<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.329> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
brighter I can put a vignette right in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
brighter I can put a vignette right in
the<00:01:30.479> middle<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.990> larger<00:01:31.619> vignette<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> different

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the middle a larger vignette a different

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.550 
the middle a larger vignette a different
tone<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.079> always<00:01:34.229> move

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
tone one to the right I can always move

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
tone one to the right I can always move
that<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.540> basic

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that if I want to and then just a basic

these<00:01:39.060> are<00:01:39.240> all<00:01:39.390> customizable<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> can

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
these are all customizable and so I can

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
these are all customizable and so I can
go<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.549> top<00:01:42.420> dial<00:01:43.409> right<00:01:43.619> here

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
go in here this top dial right here

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.460 
go in here this top dial right here
changes<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> exposure<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> contrast

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
changes the exposure I mean the contrast

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.130 
changes the exposure I mean the contrast
so<00:01:47.130> less<00:01:47.460> contrast<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.689> contrast

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so less contrast a lot more contrast

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
so less contrast a lot more contrast
I'll<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> somewhere<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> middle

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I'll put it somewhere in the middle

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
I'll put it somewhere in the middle
there<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.509> here<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.439> inner

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
there this right here is for the inner

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.300 
there this right here is for the inner
glow<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> lot<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:54.689> glow<00:01:55.140> less<00:01:55.680> glow<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
glow so a lot more glow less glow and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.940 
glow so a lot more glow less glow and
this<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.570> will<00:01:57.840> adjust<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> vignette

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this right here will adjust the vignette

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.969 
this right here will adjust the vignette
on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> outside<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.439> outside<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
on the outside so it's the outside the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.340 
on the outside so it's the outside the
inside<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> overall<00:02:03.060> contrast<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
inside and the overall contrast the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.870 
inside and the overall contrast the
other<00:02:04.380> thing<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
other thing you can do with this is you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
other thing you can do with this is you
can<00:02:06.030> choose<00:02:06.689> different<00:02:06.869> colors<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.829> here's
