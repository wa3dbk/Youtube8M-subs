the<00:02:27.700> bird's<00:02:27.940> wings<00:02:28.480> back<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.080> forth<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the bird's wings back and forth in a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.920 
the bird's wings back and forth in a
slow<00:02:31.450> rotating<00:02:32.080> manner<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.909> that<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.360> soapy

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
slow rotating manner so that the soapy

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.339 
slow rotating manner so that the soapy
water<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.470> cut<00:02:35.739> through<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.459> down<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.349> the

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
water will cut through the down and the

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.619 
water will cut through the down and the
powder<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.980> are<00:02:39.730> naturally<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.390> bird's

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
powder that are naturally in a bird's

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.130 
powder that are naturally in a bird's
feathers<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> bird<00:02:43.180> can't<00:02:43.510> fly

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
feathers so that the bird can't fly

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.550 
feathers so that the bird can't fly
once<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.739> out<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.040> landing<00:02:45.370> board<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
once it's out on the landing board so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.410 
once it's out on the landing board so
normally<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.129> count<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.700> number<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.060> times

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
normally I count the number of times

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.160 
normally I count the number of times
that<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:51.120> move<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.269> hand<00:02:52.510> back<00:02:52.659> and<00:02:52.690> forth<00:02:52.900> I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
that I move my hand back and forth I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.960 
that I move my hand back and forth I
only<00:02:53.409> do<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.860> because<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.250> found<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.819> it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
only do that because I found that it

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.199 
only do that because I found that it
takes<00:02:55.120> about<00:02:55.620> 20<00:02:56.620> times<00:02:56.799> 20<00:02:57.250> rotations<00:02:57.549> to

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
takes about 20 times 20 rotations to

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.599 
takes about 20 times 20 rotations to
really<00:02:58.540> soak<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.620> bird's<00:02:59.829> feathers<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.430> such

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
really soak the bird's feathers in such

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.780 
really soak the bird's feathers in such
a<00:03:00.640> way<00:03:00.879> they<00:03:01.540> can't<00:03:01.810> fly

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
a way they can't fly

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.339 
a way they can't fly
okay<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.940> young<00:03:04.120> birds<00:03:04.359> soak<00:03:04.959> now<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:08.109> powder

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
okay the young birds soak now the powder

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.410 
okay the young birds soak now the powder
is<00:03:08.680> pretty<00:03:08.980> much<00:03:09.099> washed<00:03:09.489> out<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.940> its<00:03:10.090> its

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
is pretty much washed out of its its

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.170 
is pretty much washed out of its its
feathers<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:12.340> wet<00:03:12.579> enough<00:03:12.609> that<00:03:12.909> it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
feathers and it's wet enough that it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.170 
feathers and it's wet enough that it
can't<00:03:13.420> fly<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.769> now<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.010> put<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.819> through<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
can't fly so now I put it through the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.830 
can't fly so now I put it through the
trap<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:17.250> let<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.340> walk<00:03:18.519> out<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.120> landing
