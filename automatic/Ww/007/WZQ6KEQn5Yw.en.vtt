00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.580
 Speaks guys, mic and dance guys want to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.180
 show you how life is made 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.910
 is f 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.070
 the light bulb just enough electricity is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 simple but they are enough pieces to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.740
 then over the map to show a to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.199
 you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.119
 The first piece is a purple disc where it is 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 who will find the good piece to find 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.510
 around the 29th I only found two 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.380
 steps to it so I guess I just have 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 two months I think it does not exist 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.849
 third party and the first of the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 side of the punk ram machine on top 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.109
 from that table wherever I go 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 catch mine and the second one is next door 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 of the day 9 exit because there is a cart 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.219
 stopped and on that car you go 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.899
 see the disco the good it is only you to catch and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.730
 to the next pieces 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.920
 besides the record we have three more 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.570
 pieces to catch using the tank people 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 You need to get into the tank and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 him there in certain places 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.120
 the first is this one just after 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 huge and chile place where I go 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 jump and then just follow the path 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.350
 take the piece and then go back to the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.090
 same way and in that first you go 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 down straight ahead even if you already 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.680
 knows generator 2 which is where the tank to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 to cool the engines and from new to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 the tank to leave for the second 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.210
 workpiece location that the third piece 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.619
 go get 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.600
 in the case of the second you get a 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.130
 tank is in the pec to punch you go seeing 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 then I'll shoot in the place where you 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 You're going to have to jump, and once and then you just jump. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.680
 You have to follow the path to get the piece and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.869
 coming back this time will not be able to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 Back to NATO you're going to have to go there 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.890
 to the garage in the church to get the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.509
 tank once again to pay for this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.850
 because it follows a path that you do not 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.810
 you have access so you have to lose 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.970
 money 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.549
 fourth in the case of the third and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.500
 last stage with tank is shortly after 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.970
 panting is on the side of the church in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.130
 reality in the church but she jumped off the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.780
 side of her you will follow in the tank will 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 having to look again next trip 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.070
 then just where I let go and follow the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 way to enter the church behind is a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.689
 area you are interested in pick up 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 the piece and then leave when you have all 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.189
 the pieces you will chase for each one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.229
 is lightning inscribed and there you go 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.280
 pick up your gramophone wanted to click on the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.500
 previous video 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 Downstairs you will have to put it. 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.420
 in the same you can put it will open 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.640
 the portal to another vital dimension 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 and there you will have how to pay the last 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.930
 ask for the element you need to 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.650
 ride the baton then it's only you come back 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.349
 at least a little 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.150
 When you pick up the gramophone and up there 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.760
 pant there you will put grass was 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.799
 again will open a staircase evidence 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.689
 and went downstairs to see four 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.819
 giants in the case of the four rather than 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.700
 I could assemble you will select the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.409
 purple light in random electricity 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.840
 to lease when you arrive 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.450
 if you press x hold it to ride 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.069
 the bat and get good so that's it 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.109
 I'm going to stay here I 'm near 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.109
 video A hug said I went
