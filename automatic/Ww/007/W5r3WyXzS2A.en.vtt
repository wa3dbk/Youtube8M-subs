while<00:03:10.620> flashing<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:12.030> always<00:03:12.269> flashback

while flashing you can always flashback
to<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.380> other<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.519> does<00:03:14.700> support<00:03:14.970> 3

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180

connectors nice and color-coded I like

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.760 
connectors nice and color-coded I like
that<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.510> like<00:04:54.540> how<00:04:54.810> it's<00:04:54.990> sort<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.590> in<00:04:55.680> this

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
that and like how it's sort of in this

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.590 
that and like how it's sort of in this
little<00:04:56.010> plastic<00:04:56.250> box<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.090> don't<00:04:57.240> bend<00:04:57.480> the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
little plastic box so you don't bend the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.210 
little plastic box so you don't bend the
pins<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.500> doesn't<00:04:58.680> look<00:04:58.710> like<00:04:58.830> crap<00:04:59.160> when

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
pins and it doesn't look like crap when

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.370 
pins and it doesn't look like crap when
they're<00:04:59.730> in<00:04:59.910> 10<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:01.080> have<00:05:01.170> right

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
they're in 10 you have right

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.620 
they're in 10 you have right

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
handle right angled connectors I believe

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.590 
handle right angled connectors I believe
all<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.380> these<00:05:04.710> are<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:06.090> probably<00:05:06.390> won't<00:05:06.540> be

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
all of these are you probably won't be

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.260 
all of these are you probably won't be
able<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.780> see<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.160> but<00:05:08.160> there's<00:05:08.370> six<00:05:08.670> USB

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
able to see that but there's six USB

new case um if you have smaller cases
that<00:05:19.410> say<00:05:19.830> they<00:05:19.980> fit<00:05:20.190> ATX<00:05:20.669> but<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:22.290> fits<00:05:22.530> right

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
that say they fit ATX but it fits right

didn't fit in there either so this is an
ATX<00:05:38.220> board<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:38.970> let's<00:05:39.330> go<00:05:39.540> over<00:05:39.720> some<00:05:39.750> other

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
ATX board so let's go over some other

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.679 
ATX board so let's go over some other
stuff<00:05:40.850> what<00:05:41.850> else<00:05:42.000> you

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689

stuff what else you
have<00:05:42.779> four<00:05:43.349> pin<00:05:43.559> cpu<00:05:43.979> Finn<00:05:44.219> is<00:05:44.639> do<00:05:44.909> that<00:05:45.119> excuse

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
have four pin cpu Finn is do that excuse

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.269 
have four pin cpu Finn is do that excuse
me<00:05:45.619> 4-pin<00:05:46.619> cpu<00:05:47.099> fan<00:05:48.289> system<00:05:49.289> fan<00:05:49.619> too<00:05:49.889> that's<00:05:50.189> a

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
me 4-pin cpu fan system fan too that's a

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.149 
me 4-pin cpu fan system fan too that's a
3-pin<00:05:50.729> assistant<00:05:51.569> and<00:05:51.779> one<00:05:52.049> which<00:05:52.409> is<00:05:52.529> a<00:05:52.559> 4-pin

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
3-pin assistant and one which is a 4-pin

00:05:53.159 --> 00:06:00.199 
3-pin assistant and one which is a 4-pin
so<00:05:54.059> that's<00:05:54.299> three<00:05:54.799> let's<00:05:55.799> see<00:05:56.189> ah<00:05:56.449> and<00:05:58.579> p<00:05:59.579> WR
