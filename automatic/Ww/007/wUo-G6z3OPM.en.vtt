have here actual testing data we
actually<00:00:35.680> know<00:00:36.190> where<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.489> craft<00:00:36.730> came<00:00:37.000> down

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
actually know where the craft came down

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.220 
actually know where the craft came down
in<00:00:38.680> this<00:00:38.980> water<00:00:39.430> course<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.080> pictures<00:00:41.080> of

in this water course and pictures of
Chuck<00:00:41.470> Wade<00:00:41.710> digging<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:44.320> also<00:00:44.500> have<00:00:44.830> soil

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
Chuck Wade digging and we also have soil

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.810 
Chuck Wade digging and we also have soil
analysis<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:48.280> also<00:00:48.400> have<00:00:48.670> more

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
analysis and we also have more

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.610 
analysis and we also have more
information<00:00:49.420> on<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.660> little<00:00:49.840> gold<00:00:50.350> wire

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
information on that little gold wire

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
information on that little gold wire
that<00:00:50.890> was<00:00:51.010> found<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.460> artificial<00:00:52.000> heart

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that was found in the artificial heart

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.930 
that was found in the artificial heart
so<00:00:53.710> our<00:00:53.950> testing<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:55.600> ongoing<00:00:55.660> and<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:57.820> be

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
so our testing is ongoing and we will be

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.790 
so our testing is ongoing and we will be
continuously<00:00:58.809> updating<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.500> with<00:00:59.530> more

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.920 

yep<00:01:08.920> okay<00:01:09.730> well<00:01:10.000> as<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.300> lighting<00:01:10.720> some

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
yep okay well as is lighting some

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.710 
yep okay well as is lighting some
ordinary<00:01:11.260> tinfoil<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:16.000> what<00:01:16.150> we<00:01:16.300> observe

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
ordinary tinfoil and what we observe

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.580 
ordinary tinfoil and what we observe
here<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.580> tinfoil<00:01:19.590> melting<00:01:22.230> it's<00:01:23.230> going

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
here is the tinfoil melting it's going

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.170 
here is the tinfoil melting it's going
red<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:24.040> fact<00:01:24.370> it's<00:01:24.760> gonna<00:01:25.060> melt<00:01:28.140> okay<00:01:30.120> now<00:01:31.120> we

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
red in fact it's gonna melt okay now we

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:40.580 
red in fact it's gonna melt okay now we
take<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.840> equivalent<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.530> Roswell<00:01:33.400> wreckage

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:55.139 

and<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:43.210> light<00:01:43.420> it

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.859 

it's<00:01:55.689> turning<00:01:55.899> red<00:01:56.049> but<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.670> glows<00:01:58.030> red<00:01:58.179> and

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
it's turning red but it glows red and

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's turning red but it glows red and
masses<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.799> we<00:02:02.920> do<00:02:03.039> not<00:02:03.130> observe<00:02:03.520> any<00:02:03.729> melting

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
masses but we do not observe any melting

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.960 
masses but we do not observe any melting
even<00:02:04.479> at<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:04.689> very<00:02:04.719> very<00:02:05.259> thin<00:02:05.590> edge<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:11.200> is

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
even at the very very thin edge this is

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.210 
even at the very very thin edge this is
weighed<00:02:12.970> 11<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:14.830> very<00:02:15.099> thin<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.069> do

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
weighed 11 very very thin so we do

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.699 
weighed 11 very very thin so we do
expect<00:02:18.549> this<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.879> melt<00:02:25.019> well<00:02:26.019> it's<00:02:26.170> not<00:02:26.319> melted

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
expect this to melt well it's not melted

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.319 
expect this to melt well it's not melted
at<00:02:26.830> all<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.579> it's<00:02:27.760> tinted<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.390> tinfoil

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
at all and it's tinted in the tinfoil

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.120 
at all and it's tinted in the tinfoil
look<00:02:31.329> at<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.720> Chuck<00:02:31.900> glowing<00:02:32.739> red

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
look at that Chuck glowing red
