know<00:01:48.600> growing<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.250> really

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
know growing up so that you can really

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.990 
know growing up so that you can really
use<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:50.939> space<00:01:51.720> efficiently<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.820> on

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

your windowsill
you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.380> grow<00:01:55.620> microgreens<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.360> grow

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you can grow microgreens you can grow

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.560 
you can grow microgreens you can grow
you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.200> herbs<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:59.070> basil<00:02:00.470> chives<00:02:01.470> parsley

mint AB cement is a very happy plant to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.949 
mint AB cement is a very happy plant to
grow<00:02:06.690> anywhere<00:02:07.290> um<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.240> things<00:02:09.810> like

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
grow anywhere um you know things like

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.840 
grow anywhere um you know things like
root<00:02:10.289> crops<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.770> want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.160> bigger<00:02:11.400> space

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
root crops you want to have bigger space

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.970 
root crops you want to have bigger space
for<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:12.810> you're<00:02:12.959> doing<00:02:13.230> containers<00:02:13.770> you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
for so if you're doing containers you

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
for so if you're doing containers you
want<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.459> about<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.540> root<00:02:15.720> space

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
want to think about the root space

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.540 
want to think about the root space
that's<00:02:16.110> why<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> set<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> five-gallon<00:02:17.190> bucket

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that's why I set a five-gallon bucket

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.070 
that's why I set a five-gallon bucket
for<00:02:17.730> tomato<00:02:18.030> plants<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
for tomato plants because they have a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.949 
for tomato plants because they have a
big<00:02:19.319> root<00:02:19.530> space<00:02:19.860> mm-hmm<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:21.840> things

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
big root space mm-hmm but for things

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.350 
big root space mm-hmm but for things
like<00:02:22.200> kale<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.730> do<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.180> much

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
like kale you can do it in a much

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.110 
like kale you can do it in a much
smaller<00:02:25.130> container<00:02:26.130> obviously<00:02:26.730> these<00:02:26.940> are

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
smaller container obviously these are

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.660 
smaller container obviously these are
huge<00:02:27.570> kale<00:02:27.989> plants<00:02:28.410> behind<00:02:28.680> us<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.160> huge

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
huge kale plants behind us and huge

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640 
huge kale plants behind us and huge
Swiss<00:02:30.269> chard<00:02:30.450> plants<00:02:30.930> behind<00:02:31.230> us<00:02:31.350> yeah

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
Swiss chard plants behind us yeah

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.970 
Swiss chard plants behind us yeah
however<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.930> baby<00:02:33.930> kale<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.680> baby

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
however you can do baby kale and baby

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.699 
however you can do baby kale and baby
Swiss<00:02:35.310> chard<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.690> know<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.170> much<00:02:37.350> soil

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
Swiss chard and you know that much soil

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.810 
Swiss chard and you know that much soil
that's<00:02:38.280> crazy

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
that's crazy

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.940 
that's crazy
so<00:02:38.940> that's<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.440> good<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.800> know

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so that's that is so good to know

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.430 
so that's that is so good to know
because<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.430> many<00:02:41.489> people<00:02:41.610> spend<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.300> $2<00:02:43.200> on

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
because so many people spend like $2 on

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.890 
because so many people spend like $2 on
kale<00:02:43.650> every<00:02:43.980> single<00:02:44.280> time<00:02:44.459> how<00:02:45.450> much<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.840> you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
kale every single time how much do you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.160 
kale every single time how much do you
think<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.140> costs<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.769> start<00:02:47.070> growing<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.000> um<00:02:48.420> it

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
think it costs to start growing it um it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.320 
think it costs to start growing it um it
depends<00:02:49.860> what<00:02:50.070> you're<00:02:50.220> doing<00:02:50.640> if<00:02:50.910> you're

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
depends what you're doing if you're

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
know and good organic seed so these are

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.970 
know and good organic seed so these are
very<00:03:17.160> reasonable<00:03:18.060> they're<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:19.260> very<00:03:19.620> cheap

do you get out of a packet like that if
this<00:03:26.850> kale<00:03:27.209> crop<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.930> probably<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.549> get<00:03:29.730> a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
this kale crop is probably if you get a

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.460 
this kale crop is probably if you get a
normal<00:03:30.180> packet<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.750> seeds<00:03:31.019> is<00:03:31.380> probably<00:03:32.160> Oh

what we're paying for food obviously

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.750 
what we're paying for food obviously
there's<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.260> value<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.549> you're

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
there's a value to it but if you're
