liner how I wanted to be and in which
direction<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:22.049> want<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
direction I want to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.960 
direction I want to
to<00:02:22.480> go<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.590> I'm<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:23.800> trying<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.370> perfectly

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to go so I'm not trying a perfectly

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.420 
to go so I'm not trying a perfectly
straight<00:02:25.420> line<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:26.319> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.040> kind<00:02:27.340> of

straight line it's going to be kind of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.800 
straight line it's going to be kind of
curved<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.630> little<00:02:29.020> bit<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.690> I'm

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
curved a little bit like so then I'm

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.760 
curved a little bit like so then I'm
going<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.410> go<00:02:33.190> over<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.840> base<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.410> my

decided to do something like that as

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.800 
decided to do something like that as
well<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.639> under<00:04:40.940> certain<00:04:41.180> lights<00:04:41.539> and
