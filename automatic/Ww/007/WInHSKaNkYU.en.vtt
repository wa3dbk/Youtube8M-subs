00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
hahaha anyway the point of this is to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
hahaha anyway the point of this is to
keep<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:29.880> pro-life<00:01:30.090> fourteen<00:01:30.720> percent

gotta stay alive bumpers light thumper

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.930 
gotta stay alive bumpers light thumper
which<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> had<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.220> tiny<00:02:14.489> thumper<00:02:14.760> light

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
which what I had this tiny thumper light

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.190 
which what I had this tiny thumper light
thumper<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.300> I'm<00:02:15.450> guessing<00:02:15.840> they're<00:02:15.930> put

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
thumper and I'm guessing they're put

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
thumper and I'm guessing they're put
medium<00:02:16.590> supper<00:02:16.950> large<00:02:17.459> supper<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.060> forth

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
medium supper large supper and so forth

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.500 
medium supper large supper and so forth
but<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.110> light<00:02:19.560> supper<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.580> considerably

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
but a light supper is considerably

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.050 
but a light supper is considerably
harder<00:02:21.780> than<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.800> tiny<00:02:23.250> thumper<00:02:23.670> which

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
harder than a tiny thumper which

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.729 
harder than a tiny thumper which
basically<00:02:24.330> means<00:02:24.570> gonna<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> lot<00:02:25.380> more<00:02:25.410> bad

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739
