00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.780
 she represents quad hamer 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.299
 mounting 200 lux 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.099
 i.e. lux mean what it is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.289
 dry model of this that is the same 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.340
 expensive equipment of this quad and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.340
 from sports to mean 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.189
 a light alloy 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.870
 more expensive more quality tire 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.930
 that is, the tire is easily suited for 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.329
 a dream for solid experience roughly speaking 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.739
 so versatile 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.649
 usually on site when liquid 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.109
 quad bike front tires a little bit already 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.109
 back tire will she sew up 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.780
 Now it's the Dnieper 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.720
 what's next 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 and slides seaman 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.360
 that is, which show and turnovers 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.990
 engine and speedometer and total mileage 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.210
 daily mileage transfer indicators then 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.210
 that in principle for that tidy is all 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.440
 the engine remains the same it is 200 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.310
 cubic centimeters adoption 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.940
 air forced cooling 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.330
 there is an impeller such 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.580
 which serves 1 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.460
 it rotates constantly 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.869
 Ie carburetor 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.070
 squared city 17 horsepower and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.250
 gearbox variator that is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.760
 switches using such a depressing 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.979
 forward gears 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.390
 neutral transfer and transfer back 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.390
 it turns on very easily 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.990
 dependently these are two different reasons 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.540
 which on ball is the most reliable 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.820
 suspension 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.940
 will be installed two times oil 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.940
 shock absorber 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.900
 which can be regulated 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.950
 rigidity 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.950
 why preload springs 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.450
 disc brakes on each wheel and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.560
 front mounted 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.560
 1 piston calipers 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.760
 disk brake 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.400
 then everything will be with 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.810
 rear-wheel drive and it rotates using here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.719
 this is the drive chain 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:52.090
 circuit 428 then I myself usually have protection 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.090
 for chain metal disc protection 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.319
 and again will stand mono 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.319
 also gazomaslyany too with adjustment 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.190
 Quad bike works pretty quiet 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.569
 at 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.270
 convenient that there is an alarm in 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.720
 bundled is not only a guard 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.720
 quad bike and remote start 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.720
 it is also possible to remotely him and 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.390
 better it is convenient for those purposes when 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.140
 There are people, children, or something else 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.430
 samson can manage a banquet about 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.910
 control damage here is easy and 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.280
 just brakes completely all on the steering wheel 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.080
 rendered i.e. this is a front brake with 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.920
 right side rear brake there is 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.540
 such are the students 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.340
 which is fixed by a flag that is by 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.470
 squeezed the brake and the quad bike is nowhere 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.040
 starter rides 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.580
 light control dipped high beam 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.720
 engine stop turns off the signal will be 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.060
 below 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.790
 gas control will be such a flag he 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.489
 gently and easily pressed that is how we 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.579
 know this is the safest management 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.579
 quad bike 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.120
 and kvadrik such kuzovatovo here 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.410
 sport class as a rule 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.410
 they are part-time all 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.630
 God can sit at my back 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:06.339
 very talk 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:08.439
 his cool suspension leg trap 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.919
 the simplest of them completely 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.479
 metal there are just such 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.440
 plastic protection that you flew dirt and 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.630
 all so they are very durable 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.139
 about the suspension suspension is awesome in 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.650
 this 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.990
 and there is such a platform for 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.680
 order to put something in front 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.110
 Of course this will not be in front of so 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.610
 Here we write the bumper all-metal 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.759
 Optics are worth a quad bike 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.150
 there are two headlights have dipped there 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.150
 further 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.309
 there are turns 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.940
 in the front and in the back 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.120
 here and again all quad their numbers 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.490
 cannot be registered that is 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.320
 Patrick will leave a reference account 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.980
 customs declaration ie full 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.800
 set of documents for registration 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.080
 about the quality of performance and the 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.030
 quad at the moment this 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.130
 one of the coolest mattresses for them 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:27.960
 cool apiary is completely like him 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.670
 maximum father and did not break on it 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.030
 you can see no scratches that is absolutely 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.030
 nothing
