the<00:00:19.599> problem<00:00:20.050> is<00:00:20.230> not<00:00:20.410> proving<00:00:21.010> that<00:00:21.130> UFOs

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550

they're getting here what scientists

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.890 
they're getting here what scientists
need<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.800> do<00:00:29.980> is<00:00:30.220> they<00:00:30.460> need<00:00:30.699> to<00:00:31.029> look<00:00:31.359> at<00:00:31.599> the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
need to do is they need to look at the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.689 
need to do is they need to look at the
hardcore<00:00:32.650> evidence<00:00:32.970> decide<00:00:33.970> that<00:00:34.690> oh<00:00:34.930> my<00:00:35.260> gosh

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699

thing going on in this planet today and

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.050 
thing going on in this planet today and
yet<00:01:48.979> nobody<00:01:49.160> talks<00:01:49.520> about<00:01:49.640> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
if we come together we can make this

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.930 
if we come together we can make this
happen<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.890> matter<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> months<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:09.569> decades

happen in a matter of months not decades
but<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.140> destiny<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.860> humanity
