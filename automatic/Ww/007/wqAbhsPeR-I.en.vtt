00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
them out as a central mid-south

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
them out as a central mid-south
attacking<00:01:50.640> mid<00:01:50.909> central<00:01:51.630> defensive<00:01:52.020> mid<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
attacking mid central defensive mid it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
attacking mid central defensive mid it
really<00:01:52.649> depends<00:01:53.009> where<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> put<00:01:53.640> him

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
really depends where you want to put him

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.810 
really depends where you want to put him
he<00:01:54.210> fits<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.720> categories<00:01:55.290> because<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:56.189> has

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
he fits all categories because he has

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520 
he fits all categories because he has
really<00:01:56.850> good<00:01:57.299> defensive<00:01:57.840> stats<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
really good defensive stats and at the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
really good defensive stats and at the
same<00:01:58.680> time<00:01:58.740> he<00:01:59.430> has<00:01:59.670> really<00:02:00.030> good<00:02:00.119> attacking

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
same time he has really good attacking

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
same time he has really good attacking
stat<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.409> depends<00:02:01.740> where<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> want

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
stat so it really depends where you want

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
stat so it really depends where you want
to<00:02:02.430> play<00:02:02.549> him<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.780> missing<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
to play him and what you're missing in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
to play him and what you're missing in
your<00:02:04.560> team<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.250> obviously<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> his<00:02:06.090> main

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
your team but obviously one of his main

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.449 
your team but obviously one of his main
attractions<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.320> strong<00:02:07.770> he<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
attractions is how strong he is and I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.070 
attractions is how strong he is and I
think<00:02:08.700> some<00:02:08.970> players<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.479> try<00:02:09.720> them<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:09.869> as

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
think some players will try them out as

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
think some players will try them out as
a<00:02:10.110> striker<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.800> could<00:02:10.950> see<00:02:11.129> him<00:02:11.280> being<00:02:11.580> you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
a striker and I could see him being you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.260 
a striker and I could see him being you
know

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
know

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790 
know
an<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.870> strike<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.380> not<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> best

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
an all right strike are not the best

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
an all right strike are not the best
because<00:02:14.550> I'll<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
because I'll get to that in just a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
because I'll get to that in just a
second<00:02:16.080> now<00:02:16.170> when<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.440> comes<00:02:16.470> down<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> this

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
second now when it comes down to this

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.820 
second now when it comes down to this
guy<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.310> finishing<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.570> isn't<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.230> best<00:02:19.470> so

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
guy is finishing it isn't the best so

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980 
guy is finishing it isn't the best so
inside<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> penalty<00:02:20.640> area<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.270> didn't<00:02:21.840> find

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
inside the penalty area I didn't find

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.750 
inside the penalty area I didn't find
him<00:02:22.140> clinical<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.800> he<00:02:22.920> lost<00:02:23.130> quite<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.490> bit<00:02:23.580> of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
him clinical and he lost quite a bit of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.120 
him clinical and he lost quite a bit of
opportunities<00:02:24.470> after<00:02:25.470> making<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:25.920> pretty

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
opportunities after making some pretty

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.850 
opportunities after making some pretty
amazing<00:02:26.400> runs<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.380> outside<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> penalty<00:02:28.620> area

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
amazing runs so outside the penalty area

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.790 
amazing runs so outside the penalty area
he's<00:02:29.280> amazing<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.180> inside<00:02:30.630> he<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.590> bit

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
he's amazing but inside he is a bit

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800 
he's amazing but inside he is a bit
shaky<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.490> finishing<00:02:32.880> isn't<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.390> grace<00:02:33.600> I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
shaky so finishing isn't the grace I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.060 
shaky so finishing isn't the grace I
look<00:02:33.960> nice<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.350> games<00:02:34.500> that's<00:02:34.740> because<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
look nice in games that's because I

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.950 
look nice in games that's because I
wanted<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.580> why<00:02:35.850> isn't<00:02:36.240> he<00:02:36.330> finishing<00:02:36.780> I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
wanted to see why isn't he finishing I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.200 
wanted to see why isn't he finishing I
love<00:02:37.500> his<00:02:37.680> opportunities<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:38.850> turns<00:02:39.090> out

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
love his opportunities and it turns out

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.360 
love his opportunities and it turns out
he<00:02:39.390> only<00:02:39.540> has<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.900> 74<00:02:40.440> finishing<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.070> isn't

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
he only has like 74 finishing so isn't

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.340 
he only has like 74 finishing so isn't
the<00:02:41.460> greatest<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.480> isn't<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.960> big<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the greatest but it isn't that big of a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.380 
the greatest but it isn't that big of a
problem<00:02:43.590> because<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.400> know<00:02:44.550> he's<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> central

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
problem because you know he's a central

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
problem because you know he's a central
mid<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> synthetic<00:02:46.080> in<00:02:46.470> mid<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.920> he's<00:02:47.460> not

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
mid or a synthetic in mid so he's not

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.060 
mid or a synthetic in mid so he's not
exactly<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.540> know<00:02:48.690> naturally<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> striker<00:02:49.680> so

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
exactly you know naturally a striker so

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.530 
exactly you know naturally a striker so
it<00:02:50.220> shouldn't<00:02:50.490> be<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.610> big<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.060> problem<00:02:51.270> in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
it shouldn't be that big of a problem in

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660 
it shouldn't be that big of a problem in
my<00:02:51.690> opinion<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.230> finishing<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.250> still<00:02:53.520> going

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
my opinion but finishing is still going

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
my opinion but finishing is still going
to<00:02:53.760> be<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.270> negatives<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:55.050> hope<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.500> guys
