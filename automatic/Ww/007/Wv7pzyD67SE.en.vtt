00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.540
 meiners how are you welcome to a 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.980
 new video and some guys in this 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.780
 chance let's talk about a survey 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.090
 made by tomás h more or less 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.410
 about three or two days I do not remember well in 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.420
 which made us choose between all 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.770
 the things we would like to see in 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.840
 micros pocket edition but what's in 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.300
 micros for pc I think I explain myself well 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.740
 then let's start these options are 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.680
 the infinite worlds the caves and 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.029
 canyons the new the redstone more 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.250
 fruits and vegetables that would be the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.079
 carrots watermelons etc etc 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.399
 we have the hundreds we keep more 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.309
 biomes that would be the swamps and jungles 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.050
 etc etc enchantment and experience of 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.300
 the positions of the maps and watches 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.250
 compass we are hungry to be able to run 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.930
 and crouch we have mine cars 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.280
 although I think that the euros are added 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.170
 of mine they would have to add 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.550
 also what are the ways also 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.469
 we have what are the villages and the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.879
 villagers or if it's on the day it would not be very 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.770
 ugly we also have what are the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.090
 horses the software that would be the grass 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 high and I think I already talked about that in a 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.469
 mean we also have the super votes 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.879
 planes and pistons I do not know that these guys 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.680
 then you know please 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.720
 twins were comments although yes I 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 although what I know is that the pistons 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.400
 what pistons that push other blocks 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.800
 I do not know I think that we also have what 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.510
 which is advance color in that if 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.550
 we change language will change what 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.290
 is the color of the grass to a green more 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.810
 dark and if we are in a tropical biome 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.310
 let's say instead a lighter green and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.280
 if we are in a snow biome more 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.290
 dark ok I think that we also have 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 what is the power to see the skin of others 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.770
 which players we would be great 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 we have collective divisions that would be 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.990
 the chests and the intestine the mods that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.700
 I would be very incredible too guys 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.920
