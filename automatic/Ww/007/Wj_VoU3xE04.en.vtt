00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 and if a person knows who his enemy is, then his 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.770
 life immediately acquires structure and purpose 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.139
 for Americans it is throughout 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 For decades there has been an obvious evil empire 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.700
 it was in the east the Soviet Union and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.619
 communism they fought they set 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 strengthening around the world against the red 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.320
 plague a home program against landslides 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.720
 a little under launched it was autumn 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.680
 In 1990, the Soviet Union itself became 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.449
 myself break up 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 in short he said we can no longer 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 Karvachar said that the arms race 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 finished we have no more money for it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.559
 you can beg as much as you want 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.780
 we are no longer participating in this race until 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 you're funny now but the American 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.090
 military industry was in shock 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.629
 the enemy just took and disappeared not even 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.550
 after consulting 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.440
 everyone started talking about peace dividends and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 how now could convince 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 the population of america is that money 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 taxpayers need to spend on 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 crazy military star projects 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.270
 wars fbi and that kind of americans 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.309
 said now the money will go to the peaceful 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.049
 goals we will build schools of the road 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 we will repair us completely 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.100
 there is no medical system and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 anti-collapse system too 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 refresh if you want to do 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.229
 crazy laws that oppress 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
 rights of citizens you need a threat 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.409
 you have to scare people for this you 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.430
 who needs the enemy and the Americans imagine him 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.920
 did they then hussein vile 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.640
 little local despot swelled 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.810
 for their own purposes 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.140
 of course Hussein was always great 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.790
 scoundrel about this even no one argues and 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.509
 that's why he was natural 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.509
 ally usa 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.600
 but never was a threat to the whole world 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.180
 but dad bush and brought the americans to 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.100
 madness before the last war 70 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.200
 percent of americans were sure that 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.630
 Hussein with his missiles can shoot yes 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.759
 America, this stupid people do not even know 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.759
 that there is water between the continents 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.410
 if I would say in 1990 that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.790
 2004 Latvia will enter the European Union 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.900
 adab did not express latvia 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.560
 and this is what the hell is I know that 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 is legalon and what is Latvia do not know 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.390
 this did not yet even exist is 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 then there were all Russians 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.050
 Have you forgotten who is Russian? 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.270
 Russian is the one that stood with us all the time 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.490
 on the threshold our youth is no longer even 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.040
 He does not know the truth if they are in this case, 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.370
 usually polite lybitsya not there yet so 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.380
 this old one needs to know that one again 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.210
 fucking young people when not quite 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.250
 rolls her eyes slightly and thinks 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:08.610
 see now he will tell me again about 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.760
 I 'm familiar with the war, because I myself look 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.130
 recently watched and in one night I 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.960
 I began to see clearly that I began to understand how my grandfather 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 I felt like when he talked about 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.700
 war if you want to feel it too 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.220
 then tell something to the 18 year old about 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.870
 how it was in the year of his birth to you 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.330
 it seems that you are from the trenches something to him 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.030
 tell tell 18-year-old 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.130
 who was born in 1990 that once 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.180
 there was no internet all the phones were from 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.690
 cord maximum 3 meters long and 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.690
 Russian stood at the door 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.689
 and that there was not even a wikipedia 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:01.310
 and how did you do your homework how 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.950
 do we explain to the young man who 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.689
 such a Russian how to explain it to him 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:13.430
 as difficult as explaining to the elderly that 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:17.259
 This Russian wikipedia was for us 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.729
 as terrible as al-Qaida is now 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.739
 only Russian did nothing secret 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.199
 Russian always stood honestly and openly 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.820
 threshold for our young Russians so 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.419
 easy on tv advertising 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.419
 milk bars 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.370
 and until such a 19 year old jerk comes this 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.360
 recently happened hamburg try 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.160
 I explain that Klitschko is from Ukraine 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.160
 that's it the guy in this and funny 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.160
 it was all Russian existed only 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.160
