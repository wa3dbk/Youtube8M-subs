here is that we will have the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.250 
here is that we will have the
orientation<00:02:37.150> from<00:02:37.300> from<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.780> sensor<00:02:38.110> we're

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
orientation from from a sensor we're

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.830 
orientation from from a sensor we're
just<00:02:38.410> still<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.830> prototype<00:02:39.040> phase<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.300> that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.750 
this thing yesterday and we'd already
heard<00:02:47.320> from<00:02:47.350> some<00:02:47.769> people<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:48.190> our<00:02:48.310> facebook

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.780 
page and across Twitter they were
wondering<00:02:50.709> about<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.100> keyboard<00:02:51.519> when<00:02:51.700> you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
wondering about the keyboard when you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.009 
wondering about the keyboard when you
flip<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.000> all<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.300> way<00:02:52.420> around<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:52.900> it's

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
flip it all the way around I think it's

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.229 
flip it all the way around I think it's
a<00:02:53.080> fairly<00:02:53.290> mind-blowing<00:02:54.010> idea<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.489> people<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
a fairly mind-blowing idea to people and

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.550 
a fairly mind-blowing idea to people and
they<00:02:55.330> wondered<00:02:55.690> when<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> keyboard<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.410> then

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they wondered when the keyboard is then

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.380 
they wondered when the keyboard is then
laying<00:02:56.800> down<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.280> facing<00:02:57.640> your<00:02:57.730> desk<00:02:58.030> what

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
laying down and facing your desk what

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.699 
laying down and facing your desk what
protects<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.959> or<00:02:59.050> what<00:02:59.200> keeps<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.530> from

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
protects it or what keeps you from

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.229 
protects it or what keeps you from
hitting<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.070> wrong<00:03:00.250> key<00:03:00.550> when<00:03:00.760> you're<00:03:00.880> holding

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
hitting a wrong key when you're holding

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.970 
hitting a wrong key when you're holding
it<00:03:01.360> as<00:03:01.480> well<00:03:01.660> great<00:03:01.989> question<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.560> first<00:03:02.830> of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
it as well great question so first of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.490 
it as well great question so first of
all<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:04.239> terms<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.690> functionality<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
all in terms of the functionality of the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.590 
all in terms of the functionality of the
keyboard<00:03:05.860> when<00:03:06.459> you're<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:06.760> laptop<00:03:07.060> mode

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
keyboard when you're in your laptop mode

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.180 
keyboard when you're in your laptop mode
you<00:03:07.840> obviously<00:03:08.230> have<00:03:08.380> full<00:03:08.590> function<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.100> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
you obviously have full function of the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.970 
you obviously have full function of the
keyboard<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:09.580> trackpad<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:11.019> get<00:03:11.230> past

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
180 the functionality is shut off so

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.259 
180 the functionality is shut off so
you're<00:03:15.340> not<00:03:15.430> going<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.670> have<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.120> know
