00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
nifty 50 there is a small difference in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
nifty 50 there is a small difference in
the<00:01:17.430> weight<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.880> definitely<00:01:18.030> feel<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the weight you can definitely feel this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.690 
the weight you can definitely feel this
is<00:01:19.080> heavier<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> little<00:01:20.189> bit<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.520> buy<00:01:20.640> too

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
is heavier by a little bit not buy too

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850

much also this lens is a little bit more

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
much also this lens is a little bit more
longer<00:01:23.159> than<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> nifty<00:01:23.939> 50<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.659> can

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
longer than the nifty 50 so you can

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.289 
longer than the nifty 50 so you can
definitely<00:01:25.280> see<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:27.180> bit

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
definitely see that it is a little bit

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
definitely see that it is a little bit
bigger<00:01:27.509> lens<00:01:27.810> overall<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.829> regardless<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bigger lens overall but regardless you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
bigger lens overall but regardless you
still<00:01:29.790> won't<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.570> problems<00:01:31.079> keeping

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
still won't have no problems keeping

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
right now goes to show how well the blur

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.839

works<00:02:44.200> with<00:02:44.469> the<00:02:44.560> lens<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.129> again<00:02:45.459> there<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.819> a

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
works with the lens and again there is a

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.879

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
really extreme blur in this picture I

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.069 
really extreme blur in this picture I
focus<00:02:48.549> more<00:02:48.790> towards<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.239> back<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.840> food

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
focus more towards the back on the food

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.899 
focus more towards the back on the food
so<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.620> front<00:02:50.889> of<00:02:51.040> spring<00:02:51.220> was<00:02:51.370> blurred<00:02:51.669> out

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
so the front of spring was blurred out

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.309 
so the front of spring was blurred out
and<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.389> doesn't<00:02:52.629> look<00:02:52.689> that<00:02:52.750> good<00:02:53.049> because

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
and it doesn't look that good because

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.110 
and it doesn't look that good because
it's<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.530> little<00:02:53.620> bit<00:02:53.799> too<00:02:53.919> extreme<00:02:54.159> and<00:02:54.700> this

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
it's a little bit too extreme and this

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.729 
it's a little bit too extreme and this
goes<00:02:55.389> to<00:02:55.510> show<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.959> get<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.230> focus

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
goes to show that you get to focus

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.490 
goes to show that you get to focus
correctly<00:02:57.220> on<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.819> subject<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.810> want<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.319> be

get<00:03:01.659> blur<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.959> out<00:03:02.109> and<00:03:02.409> I'll<00:03:02.769> be<00:03:02.919> quite<00:03:03.129> honest

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
get blur it out and I'll be quite honest

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.970 
get blur it out and I'll be quite honest
a<00:03:03.549> blurring<00:03:03.790> with<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.569> 1.4<00:03:05.260> aperture<00:03:05.859> and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
a blurring with the 1.4 aperture and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.250 
a blurring with the 1.4 aperture and
this<00:03:06.099> can<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:06.519> really<00:03:06.879> deep<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.450> extreme<00:03:07.870> so

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
this can go really deep and extreme so

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.809 
this can go really deep and extreme so
you<00:03:08.319> really<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.829> be<00:03:08.919> careful<00:03:09.069> with<00:03:09.519> what

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
you really have to be careful with what

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.849 
you really have to be careful with what
you<00:03:10.060> focus<00:03:10.569> on<00:03:10.689> this<00:03:11.079> next<00:03:11.319> photo<00:03:11.530> goes<00:03:11.739> to

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
you focus on this next photo goes to

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.409 
you focus on this next photo goes to
show<00:03:12.010> how<00:03:12.040> well<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.489> blur<00:03:12.790> can<00:03:13.030> actually<00:03:13.329> be

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
show how well the blur can actually be

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.569 
show how well the blur can actually be
really<00:03:13.599> beneficial<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.620> really<00:03:15.250> isolate

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
really beneficial it can really isolate

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.939 
really beneficial it can really isolate
the<00:03:16.269> subject<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.989> as<00:03:17.379> you<00:03:17.500> can<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:17.859> this

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
the subject and as you can see in this

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.309 
the subject and as you can see in this
picture<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.579> food<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.209> focus<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.199> the

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
picture the food I focus on is the

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.960 
picture the food I focus on is the
center<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.129> highlight<00:03:21.549> of<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.729> photo

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
center and the highlight of the photo

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.119 
center and the highlight of the photo
literally<00:03:22.870> everything<00:03:23.290> else<00:03:23.470> next<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:23.919> it<00:03:23.979> is

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
literally everything else next to it is

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.460 
literally everything else next to it is
blurred<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:24.549> even<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.299> little<00:03:25.419> food<00:03:25.810> can

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
blurred out even that little food can

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.439 
blurred out even that little food can
orchestrate<00:03:26.739> all<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.459> way<00:03:27.549> in<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.669> back<00:03:27.879> at

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
orchestrate all the way in the back at

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.839 
orchestrate all the way in the back at
the<00:03:28.629> top<00:03:28.870> left<00:03:29.229> corners<00:03:29.680> even<00:03:29.949> blurred<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.489> so

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
the top left corners even blurred out so

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.309 
the top left corners even blurred out so
this<00:03:30.970> goes<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.209> show<00:03:31.419> how<00:03:31.449> well<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.870> blur<00:03:32.079> will

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
this goes to show how well the blur will

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.039 
this goes to show how well the blur will
work<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:32.919> you<00:03:33.310> focus<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.569> on<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.870> right

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
work if you focus in the on the right

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.140 
work if you focus in the on the right
subject<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.709> have<00:03:35.949> just<00:03:36.159> a<00:03:36.280> perfect<00:03:36.699> focusing

subject and have just a perfect focusing
point<00:03:37.359> that<00:03:37.810> was<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.019> one<00:03:38.169> point<00:03:38.439> for<00:03:38.709> version

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
point that was the one point for version

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.460 
point that was the one point for version
worth<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.030> upgrade<00:03:40.060> over<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.750> 1.8<00:03:41.229> version

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
worth the upgrade over the 1.8 version

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920 
worth the upgrade over the 1.8 version
and<00:03:41.829> as<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.250> guys<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.579> all<00:03:42.759> saw<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.359> in

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and as you guys this all saw that in

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.490 
and as you guys this all saw that in
these<00:03:44.109> photos<00:03:44.439> the<00:03:44.739> 1.4<00:03:45.459> version<00:03:45.819> does

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
these photos the 1.4 version does

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.659 
these photos the 1.4 version does
outperform<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.919> won't<00:03:48.099> point<00:03:48.310> any<00:03:48.459> version

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
outperform you won't point any version

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.610 
outperform you won't point any version
by<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:48.970> little<00:03:49.209> bit<00:03:49.359> even<00:03:49.599> with<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.959> aperture

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
by a little bit even with the aperture

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.649 
by a little bit even with the aperture
and<00:03:50.829> again<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.549> do<00:03:51.669> find<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.180> pictures<00:03:52.509> with

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
and again I do find the pictures with

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.289 
and again I do find the pictures with
the<00:03:52.810> 1.4<00:03:53.470> version<00:03:53.949> at<00:03:54.099> any<00:03:54.280> aperture<00:03:54.549> compared

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
the 1.4 version at any aperture compared

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.819 
the 1.4 version at any aperture compared
to<00:03:55.389> the<00:03:55.509> whole<00:03:55.629> point<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.959> version<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.709> be<00:03:56.799> a

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
to the whole point a version to be a

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.259 
to the whole point a version to be a
little<00:03:56.979> bit<00:03:57.099> more<00:03:57.250> sharp<00:03:57.579> or<00:03:57.819> have<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> little

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
little bit more sharp or have a little

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.999 
little bit more sharp or have a little
bit<00:03:58.389> more<00:03:58.540> contrast<00:03:59.139> so<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.650> definitely

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:00.009 
bit more contrast so that definitely

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.420 
bit more contrast so that definitely
goes<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.639> as<00:04:01.359> a<00:04:01.419> big<00:04:01.840> part<00:04:02.349> also<00:04:03.009> with<00:04:03.159> a<00:04:03.189> little

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
goes in as a big part also with a little

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.219 
goes in as a big part also with a little
extra<00:04:03.759> blur<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.239> can<00:04:04.389> get<00:04:04.569> or<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.989> little

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
extra blur you can get or the little

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.080 
extra blur you can get or the little
extra<00:04:05.560> aperture<00:04:05.949> you<00:04:06.040> can<00:04:06.189> go<00:04:06.340> down<00:04:06.639> with<00:04:06.909> on

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
extra aperture you can go down with on

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.509 
extra aperture you can go down with on
the<00:04:07.419> 1.4<00:04:07.989> version<00:04:08.379> I<00:04:08.470> definitely<00:04:08.859> think<00:04:09.009> it's

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
the 1.4 version I definitely think it's

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.219 
the 1.4 version I definitely think it's
worth<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.849> money<00:04:10.090> if<00:04:10.419> you<00:04:10.540> go<00:04:10.750> ahead<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.079> use

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
worth the money if you go ahead and use

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.830 
worth the money if you go ahead and use
prime<00:04:11.620> lenses<00:04:11.979> a<00:04:12.069> lot<00:04:12.280> or<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:13.000> just<00:04:13.239> really

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
prime lenses a lot or you just really

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.689 
prime lenses a lot or you just really
want<00:04:14.139> a<00:04:14.349> lens<00:04:14.530> kit<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:14.949> goes<00:04:15.159> down<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.459> little

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
want a lens kit that goes down a little

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.210 
want a lens kit that goes down a little
bit<00:04:15.849> lower<00:04:16.060> in<00:04:16.419> aperture<00:04:17.229> for<00:04:17.829> me<00:04:17.979> personally

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
bit lower in aperture for me personally

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.789 
bit lower in aperture for me personally
the<00:04:18.669> 1.4<00:04:19.329> version<00:04:19.690> definitely<00:04:20.109> helped<00:04:20.680> me<00:04:20.769> out

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
the 1.4 version definitely helped me out

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.170 
the 1.4 version definitely helped me out
a<00:04:20.919> little<00:04:21.190> bit<00:04:21.370> when<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.639> was<00:04:21.669> shooting

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
a little bit when I was shooting

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.629 
a little bit when I was shooting

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
an event and that 1.4 aperture have

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.189 
an event and that 1.4 aperture have
really<00:04:24.970> helped<00:04:25.509> me<00:04:25.600> out<00:04:25.630> in<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.960> dark

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
really helped me out in the dark

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
lens is worth the upgrade from the nifty
50<00:04:53.979> because<00:04:54.430> one

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
50 because one

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.210 
50 because one
this<00:04:55.120> can<00:04:55.330> go<00:04:55.449> lower<00:04:55.720> in<00:04:55.840> an<00:04:55.990> aperture<00:04:56.289> and<00:04:56.680> two

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
this can go lower in an aperture and two

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.950 
this can go lower in an aperture and two
it<00:04:57.520> takes<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.820> little<00:04:58.000> little<00:04:58.630> bit<00:04:58.780> better

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
it takes a little little bit better

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.770 
it takes a little little bit better
images<00:04:59.680> than<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.430> 1.8<00:05:01.120> version<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.660> again

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
images than the 1.8 version and again

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.290 
images than the 1.8 version and again
the<00:05:02.349> build<00:05:02.530> quality<00:05:02.680> isn't<00:05:03.099> you<00:05:03.940> know<00:05:04.060> that

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
the build quality isn't you know that

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.870 
the build quality isn't you know that
great<00:05:04.690> of<00:05:04.810> an<00:05:04.960> improvement<00:05:05.320> it's<00:05:05.620> not<00:05:05.949> there

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
great of an improvement it's not there

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.360 
great of an improvement it's not there
to<00:05:07.630> where<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.020> can<00:05:08.169> compare<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.740> an<00:05:08.800> L<00:05:09.009> Series

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
to where you can compare to an L Series

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.640 
to where you can compare to an L Series
lens<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.509> definitely<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.050> improved<00:05:11.560> from

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
lens but it definitely is improved from

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.010 
lens but it definitely is improved from
the<00:05:11.710> nifty<00:05:12.099> 50<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.699> addition<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.419> will<00:05:13.720> see

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
the nifty 50 in addition you will see

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.870 
the nifty 50 in addition you will see
that<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.349> next<00:05:14.770> lens<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.220> goes<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.729> an

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
that the next lens that goes to an

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.110 
that the next lens that goes to an
aperture<00:05:16.180> 1.2<00:05:17.110> with<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.650> 50<00:05:18.009> millimeter<00:05:18.190> focal

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
aperture 1.2 with a 50 millimeter focal

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.110 
aperture 1.2 with a 50 millimeter focal
point<00:05:19.509> is<00:05:19.690> about<00:05:20.349> 1600<00:05:21.099> bucks<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:21.789> that<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.090> a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
point is about 1600 bucks so that is a

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.629 
point is about 1600 bucks so that is a
really<00:05:22.720> big<00:05:22.960> gap<00:05:23.199> as<00:05:23.530> far<00:05:24.130> as<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.370> money<00:05:24.550> goes

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
really big gap as far as the money goes

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.839 
really big gap as far as the money goes
so<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.750> 1.8<00:05:26.260> version<00:05:26.470> is<00:05:26.770> about<00:05:26.830> 110<00:05:27.580> bucks

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
so the 1.8 version is about 110 bucks

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.600 
so the 1.8 version is about 110 bucks
this<00:05:28.330> verse<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.320> 1.4<00:05:30.010> version<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.520> about

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
this verse and the 1.4 version is about

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.100 
this verse and the 1.4 version is about
350<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.630> then<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.580> 1.2<00:05:33.580> versions<00:05:34.060> about<00:05:34.180> 1600

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
350 and then the 1.2 versions about 1600

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.350 
350 and then the 1.2 versions about 1600
bucks<00:05:35.289> that's<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.770> big<00:05:36.159> gap<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.699> money<00:05:36.909> so<00:05:37.300> I

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
bucks that's a big gap the money so I

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.330 
bucks that's a big gap the money so I
think<00:05:37.449> this<00:05:37.720> is<00:05:37.900> probably<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:38.440> lens<00:05:39.159> in<00:05:39.280> the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
think this is probably the lens in the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.670 
think this is probably the lens in the
middle<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:39.820> it<00:05:40.659> definitely<00:05:40.870> is<00:05:41.320> worth<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
middle and it definitely is worth the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.020 
middle and it definitely is worth the
money<00:05:41.830> because<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.400> build<00:05:42.610> quality<00:05:42.820> is

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
money because the build quality is

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.450 
money because the build quality is
decent<00:05:43.210> takes<00:05:44.080> great<00:05:44.349> images<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:44.949> the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
decent takes great images and the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.939 
decent takes great images and the
aperture<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:46.090> can<00:05:46.240> go<00:05:46.389> down<00:05:46.599> to<00:05:46.630> a<00:05:46.870> really<00:05:47.139> low

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
aperture it can go down to a really low

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.680 
aperture it can go down to a really low
aperture<00:05:48.490> as<00:05:48.699> far<00:05:49.150> as<00:05:49.210> you<00:05:49.300> can<00:05:49.419> find<00:05:49.599> the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
aperture as far as you can find the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.540 
aperture as far as you can find the
market<00:05:50.080> today<00:05:50.199> so<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.889> go<00:05:51.009> ahead<00:05:51.159> and<00:05:51.370> conclude

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
market today so to go ahead and conclude

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.670 
market today so to go ahead and conclude
this<00:05:51.849> video<00:05:52.030> there<00:05:52.330> are<00:05:52.360> four<00:05:52.720> reasons<00:05:52.960> why<00:05:53.199> I

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
this video there are four reasons why I

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.830 
this video there are four reasons why I
would<00:05:54.070> go<00:05:54.190> in<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:54.430> upgrade<00:05:54.729> from<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.970> 1.8<00:05:55.539> one

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
would go in and upgrade from the 1.8 one

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.629 
would go in and upgrade from the 1.8 one
reason<00:05:56.229> is<00:05:56.380> it<00:05:56.740> can<00:05:56.919> take<00:05:57.099> slightly<00:05:57.370> better

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
reason is it can take slightly better

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.270 
reason is it can take slightly better
images<00:05:58.150> than<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.419> 1.8<00:05:58.930> -<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.949> build<00:06:00.130> quality

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
images than the 1.8 - the build quality

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.100 
images than the 1.8 - the build quality
is<00:06:00.580> a<00:06:00.610> little<00:06:00.639> bit<00:06:00.909> more<00:06:01.030> improved<00:06:01.570> than<00:06:01.810> the

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
is a little bit more improved than the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.460 
is a little bit more improved than the
1.8<00:06:02.680> which<00:06:02.860> is<00:06:03.009> definitely<00:06:03.340> a<00:06:03.699> big<00:06:04.150> deal<00:06:04.419> and<00:06:04.630> 3

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
1.8 which is definitely a big deal and 3

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.860 
1.8 which is definitely a big deal and 3
I<00:06:05.710> can<00:06:06.039> go<00:06:06.340> a<00:06:06.370> little<00:06:06.610> bit<00:06:06.820> lower<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:07.210> up<00:06:07.360> short

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
I can go a little bit lower and up short

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.810 
I can go a little bit lower and up short
compared<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.409> 1.8<00:06:08.919> and<00:06:09.130> to<00:06:09.460> be<00:06:09.580> quite

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
compared to the 1.8 and to be quite

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.879 
compared to the 1.8 and to be quite
honest<00:06:10.210> aperture<00:06:10.810> really<00:06:11.110> does<00:06:11.650> make<00:06:11.860> a

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
honest aperture really does make a

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.260 
honest aperture really does make a
difference<00:06:11.979> because<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.580> lot<00:06:12.789> of<00:06:12.820> people<00:06:13.150> go

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
difference because a lot of people go
