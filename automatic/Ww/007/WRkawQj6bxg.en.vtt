00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
pocket change but the main reason is

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.809 
pocket change but the main reason is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
think to myself if I'm going to make a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.520 
think to myself if I'm going to make a
video<00:03:30.390> there's<00:03:30.780> no<00:03:30.870> point<00:03:31.049> me<00:03:31.170> having<00:03:31.440> it

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
video there's no point me having it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.870 
video there's no point me having it
sitting<00:03:31.769> on<00:03:31.890> my<00:03:31.980> hard<00:03:32.130> drive<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.519> mother<00:03:32.760> just

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
sitting on my hard drive a mother just

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.030 
sitting on my hard drive a mother just
upload<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.359> straight<00:03:33.569> away<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.140> now<00:03:34.680> I'll<00:03:34.920> be

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
upload it straight away but now I'll be

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.620 
upload it straight away but now I'll be
able<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.340> upload<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.819> video<00:03:36.060> said<00:03:36.420> when<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
able to upload the video said when it

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.030 
able to upload the video said when it
goes<00:03:36.750> live<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.410> sort<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.650> build<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
goes live so I can sort of build a

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.699 
goes live so I can sort of build a
backlog<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.579> videos<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.500> makes

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
backlog on videos and if that makes

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.740 
backlog on videos and if that makes

sense and obviously the banners a nice

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.780 
sense and obviously the banners a nice
touch<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.200> well<00:03:43.280> he<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.340> gives<00:03:44.700> you
