 Here is such a delicious enough 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.390
 far down like 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.390
 save up and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:55.290
 I think it's called she'd have 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.240
 that is, well, in other words tracker name 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 gave it to him because of those 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.740
 tools that is like three pirates 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.659
 boredom besides i'm a hunter who 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 hunt using traps and 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.119
 some small game that can 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.330
 get there 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.890
 catch rabbits there 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:21.090
 beavers there so on and then he needs and 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.530
 remove the skin and that's not to pierce 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 when removing do not pierce the resort 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.220
 used here 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:34.980
 leg plan usual less ordinary 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:39.330
 legs here here so here in search 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.500
 light on the name given here is some 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.570
 Mass repair masonic probably symbol 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.530
 here is what is here 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:56.900
 is written do not see a little 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 screen and something did not write tea on 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:07.530
 model name and steel 440 but it is 440 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.110
 and steel, in principle, made good legs 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.720
 he is very very inexpensive at the same time but in 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 In principle, a good box is beautiful itself 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.940
 pain looks nice on its own 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.820
 bolster and brass that's this stuff and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.769
 from not remembers laundering those I'll write in 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.390
 principle, that is, a little bit of flaws 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.850
 small assemblies may be there 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.079
 small gaps so there is no focus 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.930
 here you can see the gap here 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.250
 principle very interesting looking 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.460
 leg as for its price at all 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.350
 raw raider company which makes 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.300
 but they could have a big ruler in 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.100
 principle on the belly but they are 1 and 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.640
 specializations this is exactly traditional 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.700
 american knives made in china 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.320
 they make them so very decent 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:05.330
 quality given the price for which they are 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:08.990
 which they sell them that is of course 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.530
 this is not chris cutlery this is of course not 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.020
 queen drops is not great east 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.570
 cutlery that is it is traditional 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.610
 US companies that collect 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.320
 knives and already there long enough there 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.030
 steward can be that is them of course 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.600
 quality but nowhere else is completely different 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.690
 price they are made us they are in china that's how 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.660
 Here for the Chinese here is this one raw 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.700
 raider epic in my opinion the best 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.030
 choice by price-quality ratio if 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.880
 Here someone is interested here in 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:51.590
 so american traditional style 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:54.980
 the knives that we are cheap at the same time 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.470
 let's say so they make 440 and since steel 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.790
 refuse kees cutlery 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.680
 states does it with 420 steel they don't 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.590
 they say they say surgical is not two 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:14.360
 things are steel or do they also do it 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.550
 the composition of 1095 case kuffar had such 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.270
 here's a knife 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:24.620
 gift box in company count 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:29.470
 raider inexpensive cute in principle 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.670
 less qualitatively assembled knife 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.870
 american design from china 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.870
 Thanks for attention
