well the next case I've got this morning
looks<00:00:02.610> like<00:00:02.790> quite<00:00:02.970> an<00:00:03.210> interesting<00:00:03.480> one<00:00:03.780> it's

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
looks like quite an interesting one it's

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.349 
looks like quite an interesting one it's
a<00:00:04.049> cat<00:00:04.200> called<00:00:04.380> Tommy<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.790> says<00:00:06.000> on<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
a cat called Tommy and it says on the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.960 
a cat called Tommy and it says on the
the<00:00:07.140> information<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.799> get<00:00:07.950> through<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
the information that we get through the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.089 
the information that we get through the
conversation<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.780> tail<00:00:10.200> been<00:00:10.620> trapped<00:00:10.920> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
conversation and tail been trapped I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.799 
conversation and tail been trapped I
think<00:00:11.340> no<00:00:11.610> movement<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> tail<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.690> that

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
think no movement to tail and that

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.320 
think no movement to tail and that
sounds<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.799> bit<00:00:14.070> suspicious<00:00:14.610> sounds<00:00:15.030> like<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
sounds a bit suspicious sounds like it

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.720 
sounds a bit suspicious sounds like it
could<00:00:15.540> be<00:00:15.770> some<00:00:16.770> damage<00:00:17.010> perhaps<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.609> an

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
could be some damage perhaps from an

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.060 
could be some damage perhaps from an
accident<00:00:18.060> possibly<00:00:18.600> from<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> car<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
accident possibly from a car and the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.060 
accident possibly from a car and the
tail<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.310> quite<00:00:20.609> common<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.060> cats<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> being<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
tail is quite common in cats so being to

is he still eating and the most likely

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.100 
is he still eating and the most likely
cause<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:52.940> something<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.480> some

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
cause of something like this is some

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
cause of something like this is some
kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.469> injury<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.760> looking<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
kind of injury and just looking at that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.860 
kind of injury and just looking at that
he's<00:00:59.600> I<00:01:00.600> mean<00:01:00.899> he's<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.680> appears<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.370> no

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
he's I mean he's got appears to have no

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
he's I mean he's got appears to have no
no<00:01:03.870> muscle<00:01:04.260> tone<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> way

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
no muscle tone there at all all the way

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.289 
no muscle tone there at all all the way
from<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.220> actually<00:01:08.220> yeah<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.670> feel<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
from here and actually yeah I can feel a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.310 
from here and actually yeah I can feel a
lump<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.680> um<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.990> suspect<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
lump there which um I suspect is a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.700 
lump there which um I suspect is a
fracture<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.939> feels<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.259> disease

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
fracture it feels to me that the disease

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.070 
fracture it feels to me that the disease
had<00:01:16.979> am<00:01:17.540> definitely<00:01:18.540> some<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> traumatic

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
had am definitely some kind of traumatic

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.289 
had am definitely some kind of traumatic
incident<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:21.119> quite

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
incident because there's also it's quite

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.649 
incident because there's also it's quite
nobly<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> bit<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
nobly and and what this is is a bit of a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.539 
nobly and and what this is is a bit of a
guess<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.320> happen<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.799> cats<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.250> if

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
guess but what can happen in cats is if

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.319 
guess but what can happen in cats is if
they<00:01:26.970> they're<00:01:27.840> quick<00:01:28.259> enough<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> avoid<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> car

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
they they're quick enough to avoid a car

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.670 
they they're quick enough to avoid a car
they<00:01:30.329> run<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> car<00:01:30.960> come<00:01:31.140> dog<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> car

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
they run on the car come dog in the car

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.550 
they run on the car come dog in the car
goes<00:01:31.860> over<00:01:32.070> their<00:01:32.189> tail<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.530> they

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
goes over their tail and as they as they

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
goes over their tail and as they as they
run<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> pulls<00:01:35.700> their<00:01:35.970> tail<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
run off it kind of pulls their tail and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.830 
run off it kind of pulls their tail and
it<00:01:36.990> dislocates<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.950> bones<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.630> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it dislocates the bones at the back of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.830 
it dislocates the bones at the back of
the<00:01:39.990> tail<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.460> suspect<00:01:42.150> that's<00:01:42.540> what's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the tail here I suspect that's what's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.859 
the tail here I suspect that's what's
happened<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.509> unfortunately<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> most

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
happened and unfortunately the most

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
happened and unfortunately the most
likely<00:01:46.110> outcome<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
likely outcome is that we have to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.710 
likely outcome is that we have to
amputate<00:01:48.090> his<00:01:48.329> tail<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:50.009> recommend

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
amputate his tail what I would recommend

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.020 
amputate his tail what I would recommend
is<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.860> took<00:01:53.070> an<00:01:53.250> x-ray<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.700> his<00:01:53.790> beta

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
is that we took an x-ray of his beta

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
is that we took an x-ray of his beta
term<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.540> could<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.259> serious<00:01:55.770> it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
term that we could see how serious it

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.090 
term that we could see how serious it
was

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
was

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
was
if<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.729> looks<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.240> no<00:01:57.450> chance<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
if it looks like there's no chance of it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
if it looks like there's no chance of it
recovering<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> complete

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
recovering because there's a complete

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.950 
recovering because there's a complete
fracture<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.350> would<00:02:01.469> make<00:02:01.710> sense<00:02:02.009> to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
fracture then it would make sense to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.149 
fracture then it would make sense to
remove<00:02:03.960> his<00:02:04.079> tail<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.469> same<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.040> we

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
remove his tail at the same time as we

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.869 
remove his tail at the same time as we
did<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> x-ray<00:02:06.140> if<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.619> looks<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.160> actually

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
did the x-ray if it looks like actually

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
did the x-ray if it looks like actually
there's<00:02:09.149> there's<00:02:09.450> no<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.800> completely

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
there's there's no it's not completely

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
there's there's no it's not completely
out<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.459> place<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.030> hope<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.930> could

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
out of place as a hope then we could

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.620 
out of place as a hope then we could
leave<00:02:13.349> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
leave it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.910 
leave it

response he made we'll get him fixed up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.700

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
gonna anesthetize him and the first

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.670 
gonna anesthetize him and the first
thing<00:02:28.660> we're<00:02:28.750> gonna<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.050> take<00:02:29.170> an<00:02:29.320> x-ray

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
thing we're gonna do is take an x-ray

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.920 
thing we're gonna do is take an x-ray
and<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.850> assess<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.270> extent<00:02:31.630> of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
and see if we can assess the extent of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.810 
and see if we can assess the extent of
the<00:02:32.020> damage<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.410> his<00:02:32.680> tail<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.190> check<00:02:33.700> for

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
the damage to his tail and check for

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.800 
the damage to his tail and check for
other<00:02:33.880> injuries<00:02:34.240> particularly<00:02:34.570> with<00:02:34.780> his

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
other injuries particularly with his

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.120 
other injuries particularly with his
pelvis<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:36.070> area<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> Tommy's<00:02:38.830> asleep

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
pelvis and that area so Tommy's asleep

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.190 
pelvis and that area so Tommy's asleep
now<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> better<00:02:40.360> examination<00:02:41.080> of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
now we can have a better examination of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.050 
now we can have a better examination of
him<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.500> he's<00:02:41.770> he's<00:02:42.190> lost<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:42.520> fur<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.760> that

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
him and he's he's lost some fur on that

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.310 
him and he's he's lost some fur on that
leg<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.690> down<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:45.300> his<00:02:46.300> nails<00:02:46.570> look<00:02:46.900> okay

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
leg and down there his nails look okay

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.220 
leg and down there his nails look okay
but<00:02:48.330> there's<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> really<00:02:49.720> there's<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.050> big

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
but there's a really there's a big

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.860 
but there's a really there's a big
swelling<00:02:50.740> at<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.550> base<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:52.090> his<00:02:52.240> tail<00:02:52.300> there

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
swelling at the base of his tail there

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.170 
swelling at the base of his tail there
which<00:02:53.080> feels<00:02:53.350> like<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.940> quite<00:02:54.940> serious

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
which feels like a quite serious

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.790 
which feels like a quite serious
fracture<00:02:55.720> or<00:02:55.780> dislocation<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.410> his<00:02:56.560> tail

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
fracture or dislocation of his tail

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.920 
fracture or dislocation of his tail
which<00:02:57.490> is<00:02:57.520> why<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:57.970> gone<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.300> floppy<00:02:58.630> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
which is why it's gone so floppy and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.560 
which is why it's gone so floppy and
then<00:02:59.350> at<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.560> end<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.920> his<00:03:00.010> tail<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:01.360> all

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
then at the end of his tail that's all

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.450 
then at the end of his tail that's all
kind<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.870> fused<00:03:02.590> together<00:03:02.740> which<00:03:03.040> might<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.370> an

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
kind of fused together which might be an

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.270 
kind of fused together which might be an
old<00:03:03.610> injury<00:03:04.390> or<00:03:05.230> was<00:03:05.410> possibly<00:03:05.860> somehow

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
old injury or was possibly somehow

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.390 
old injury or was possibly somehow
connected<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:06.970> as<00:03:07.150> well<00:03:07.330> but<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:08.400> can't

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
connected to this as well but I can't

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.160 
connected to this as well but I can't
feel<00:03:09.550> any<00:03:09.760> other<00:03:09.910> injuries<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.810> his<00:03:10.900> pelvis

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
feel any other injuries of his pelvis

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.890 
feel any other injuries of his pelvis
which<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.710> encouraging<00:03:12.040> because<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.810> know

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
which is encouraging because you know

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.960 
which is encouraging because you know
that<00:03:14.050> would<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.430> make<00:03:15.430> his<00:03:15.550> injuries<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.910> lot

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
that would be make his injuries a lot

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.910 
that would be make his injuries a lot
more<00:03:16.270> serious<00:03:16.660> but<00:03:16.810> as<00:03:17.050> it<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.530> think<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
more serious but as it is I think the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.950 
more serious but as it is I think the
likely<00:03:18.340> outcome<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.700> he's<00:03:19.510> gonna<00:03:19.690> end<00:03:19.870> up

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
likely outcome is he's gonna end up

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.710 
likely outcome is he's gonna end up
being<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.470> cat<00:03:20.680> with<00:03:20.830> no<00:03:20.950> tail<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:25.420> joe<00:03:25.600> ingles

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
being a cat with no tail it's joe ingles

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.500 
being a cat with no tail it's joe ingles
here<00:03:26.050> from<00:03:26.260> vets<00:03:26.470> clinic<00:03:26.910> district<00:03:27.910> yeah<00:03:28.360> he's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
here from vets clinic district yeah he's

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.600 
here from vets clinic district yeah he's
fine<00:03:28.750> yes<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.160> let<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.370> know<00:03:30.400> we've

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
fine yes and just to let you know we've

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.760 
fine yes and just to let you know we've
done<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.910> x-rays<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.630> had<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.320> further<00:03:32.590> look

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
done the x-rays and had a further look

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.410 
done the x-rays and had a further look
at<00:03:32.830> his<00:03:32.950> tail<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.310> we<00:03:33.430> we<00:03:33.670> are<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.060> opinion

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
at his tail and we we are of the opinion

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.320 
at his tail and we we are of the opinion
it<00:03:34.540> makes<00:03:34.660> sense<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.260> amputate<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:36.330> because

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
it makes sense to amputate it because

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.720 
it makes sense to amputate it because
there's<00:03:37.720> quite<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.900> clear<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.580> area<00:03:39.580> of

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
there's quite a clear and area of

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.760 
there's quite a clear and area of
fracture<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.180> dislocation<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.680> is

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
fracture and dislocation so and there is

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.890 
fracture and dislocation so and there is
a<00:03:41.800> small<00:03:42.160> chance<00:03:42.550> that<00:03:42.820> if<00:03:43.180> left<00:03:43.450> he<00:03:43.720> might

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
a small chance that if left he might

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.900 
a small chance that if left he might
regain<00:03:44.110> feeling<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.340> it's<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.760> pretty

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
regain feeling but it and it's a pretty

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.970 
regain feeling but it and it's a pretty
small<00:03:46.030> charge<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.290> think<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.650> just<00:03:47.680> makes

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
small charge and I think it just makes

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.500 
small charge and I think it just makes
sense<00:03:48.100> while<00:03:48.370> he's<00:03:48.550> asleep<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:49.180> do<00:03:49.330> that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
sense while he's asleep to do that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.150 
sense while he's asleep to do that
because<00:03:49.690> he'll<00:03:49.900> cope<00:03:50.140> fine<00:03:50.410> without<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.950> tail

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
because he'll cope fine without the tail

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.940 
because he'll cope fine without the tail
so<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:52.300> would<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.510> our<00:03:52.870> advice<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.590> and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
so and that would be our advice so and

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.560 
so and that would be our advice so and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
you buh-bye right so the x-rays have

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.080 
you buh-bye right so the x-rays have
confirmed<00:04:11.470> what<00:04:11.770> we<00:04:11.890> expected<00:04:12.610> really<00:04:12.880> that

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
confirmed what we expected really that

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.180 
confirmed what we expected really that
he's<00:04:13.270> got<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> quite<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> nasty<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.709> dislocation

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
he's got a quite a nasty and dislocation

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.400 
he's got a quite a nasty and dislocation
of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.910> tail<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.660> sort<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.870> gone<00:04:17.020> out<00:04:17.140> of<00:04:17.170> place

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
of the tail it sort of gone out of place

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.690 
of the tail it sort of gone out of place
and<00:04:17.590> come<00:04:17.739> back<00:04:17.859> in<00:04:18.070> there's<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.310> lot<00:04:18.609> of

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
and come back in there's a lot of

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.030 
and come back in there's a lot of
swelling<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.359> bony<00:04:20.109> damage<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.799> think<00:04:20.920> it's

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
swelling and bony damage so I think it's

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.590 
swelling and bony damage so I think it's
highly<00:04:21.310> unlikely<00:04:21.430> he's<00:04:21.760> ever<00:04:21.970> gonna<00:04:22.120> regain

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
highly unlikely he's ever gonna regain

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.140 
highly unlikely he's ever gonna regain
feeling<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.350> motion<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:23.800> his<00:04:23.890> tail

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
feeling and motion in his tail

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.659 
feeling and motion in his tail
amputate<00:04:26.020> his<00:04:26.139> tail<00:04:26.380> so<00:04:26.710> that's<00:04:27.460> what<00:04:27.580> we're

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
amputate his tail so that's what we're

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.700 
amputate his tail so that's what we're
about<00:04:27.699> to<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.300> he<00:04:28.540> will<00:04:28.930> then<00:04:29.110> go<00:04:29.290> home

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
about to do so he will then go home

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.610 
about to do so he will then go home
-<00:04:30.160> his<00:04:30.280> tail<00:04:30.550> but<00:04:30.850> it'll<00:04:31.660> reduce<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:32.080> pain<00:04:32.320> and

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
- his tail but it'll reduce the pain and

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.200 
- his tail but it'll reduce the pain and
long-term<00:04:33.280> it's<00:04:33.520> gonna<00:04:33.639> be<00:04:33.729> a<00:04:33.759> lot<00:04:33.880> better<00:04:34.030> for

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
long-term it's gonna be a lot better for

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:42.610 
long-term it's gonna be a lot better for
him

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.520 

okay<00:04:43.620> well<00:04:43.800> that's<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.220> operation<00:04:45.000> finished

so call me ease tail no no longer
attached<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.560> him<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:54.380> he'll<00:04:55.380> be<00:04:55.500> an<00:04:55.560> awful

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740

lot<00:04:55.830> better<00:04:55.980> off<00:04:56.130> without<00:04:56.280> it

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640
