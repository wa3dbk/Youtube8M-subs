00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.530
 and very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.140
 here we are in a new career with 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.090
 subscribers and good as you know 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.500
 you have in the description of skype in the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.600
 that you are passing me a reality is not 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.820
 the co and well let's run now is 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.849
 take profit to see how we can 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.150
 solve this so we can win and 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.710
 good to see if we can win this 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.480
 career that is a bit entertaining 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.000
 up quite difficult especially the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.739
 little picture that you will see in the thumbnail that is 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.140
 the hardest thing and I think there's going to be 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.390
 in all this because it 's kind of like 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.870
 of 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.820
 for course 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 you can call for curve law as you see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 I shut up because I thought they were 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 carrying on the phone but not 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.730
 hallucinations of mine come let's go the putada 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.770
 is that I do not have any motorcycle tuned and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.390

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.860
 that we are nine to see if we can at 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.000
 They take the motorbike so it's better and it's good 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.220

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.360
