00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.029
 good guys because it's a unix chevrolet 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.759
 How can you see a beautiful car? 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:14.670
 comfortable car but the general motors 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.690
 made loads on this car and a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.039
 from them 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.039
 I'll show you 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.640
 the design of the car allows the seat 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:39.390
 of the vehicle comes at its end until 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 here is causing friction as 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 you can see a friction in the console and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.440
 this friction has caused nothing more 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 less than wear 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 today the island of a car with six thousand 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.230
 kilometers and five months of use 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.580
 this is how it was opened tite na gm 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 today he says the following to gm asks for 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.840
 that I use the bank do not use the bank until 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.299
 far end 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 The question that remains is whether the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.040
 The car was designed so that the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:25.170
 I was here because I have to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.330
 to use the bank so far has a ticket 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 open the chevrolet dealership 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.950
 career said the guarantee did not cover 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.290
 this kind of problem because the exchange of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
 console does not solve this issue 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.909
 in a short time to consult again 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.259
 This way we are waiting for the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.729
 GM engineering assessment to show 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 You're not only from that side. 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.119
 and I say the problem is not exclusive 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 the problem is not unique to my car 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.619
 the dealer and the prism has the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 same problem a bus also has the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.439
 same problem on my side here where 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 drive is slightly lower 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.580
 I do not know if you can see in the video but 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.030
 also has a little wear here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.370
 put the whole seat back and try 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.040
 focus to win 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.489
 follows that it already has a small wear 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.030
 here o 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:25.940
 a company the size of gm does not have 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.140
 ability to draw a car right in 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 correct form 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.470
 a car of almost 40 thousand reais month six 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.340
 months of use is already in these conditions 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.790
 release this video to gm you need 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.430
 repair the car and so it's a great 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.430
 car but that defect killed a hug
