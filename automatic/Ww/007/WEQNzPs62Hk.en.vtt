 hello to all the guys here in Toulouse 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.369
 and here we are with a new video here 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.950
 we are in the company of our ngm how 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.230
 cabbage is called dynamic max here 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.099
 dynamic maxi so we're going to fight 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.590
 she the gm dynamic mad so now we are 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.450
 on the computer at the same time you can 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.470
 see on the right side here of the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.970
 screen here you see it yes plan of 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.520
 remio mouse our mgm so let's go 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.410
 first to fight this device there 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.020
 will serve this program I will put the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.310
 link of these two headlights rar file 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.910
 description and to download then a 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.630
 Once extracted here you have the drivers here 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.339
 you have drivers for 64 and 32 bits and then here 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.290
 there will be the program is there 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 recovery the cvm because it trains put 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.760
 also then recover it first then 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.450
 what we need to start this program 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.250
 normal with with the administrator is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 practically we saw that we already have it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 burp why before 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.740
 obviously we make a video there 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.650
 succeeds we redo it practically and en 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 route log this program is great 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.299
 for example to send it as a guarantee 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 why call me trek and remove the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.750
 all he once did if he succeeded 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.670
 i hate the loprevite button because 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.140
 I would practically take off connected's 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.369
 all this is nice these gounod 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.580
 when we did you must send in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.619
 guarantee so you will not notice it all 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.420
 so we did it so you don't 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.450
 worry just press this here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.140
 will do at 4 steps 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.100
 will be shown here then not even yes 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.219
 will not even start and you will be here vi 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.259
 you have to overcome then you'll have to restart 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.700
 obviously the device is completely 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.510
 normal 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.370
 then the burp was completed state 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.780
 completed very shortly and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.849
 correctly then the time made 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.860
 all we come to pretty much the cvm 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.959
 cvm we will have to put it because we the us 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.959
 to connect it to the computer 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.910
 we have put here however that it is removed 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.650
 I don't always understand why anyway 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.489
 we put the options here 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.280
 developer night on the failed the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.519
 developer portion had matteo 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.980
 we activated the usb devices so not 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.489
 we had to activate it as a mass memory 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.530
 now you have to go by usb and you need to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.380
 connect it in mass memory because 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.459
 we should put this file 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.769
 image 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.840
 we will have to put it on the card on the sd 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:09.590
 external so as to download an avi file 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.590
 we'll show you on your mobile here 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.840
 empty clerical folders 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.359
 here it goes, then he runs away 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.130
 here it is there is the device then it 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.410
 we remove and where you have to put 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.100
 root here it is placed in the time 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.650
 root you have to go to play store e 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.269
 download this here mobil again 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.790
 practically this piece of furniture is the unleft vi 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.340
 will put the recovery that is you have to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.139
 disable I recommend if it will work 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.530
 where to turn off mass memory 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.590
 if you want to be really sure you can 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.160
 well, remove the cable anyway by going here 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.540
 Let's go mobile uncle went as 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.159
 uncle 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.870
 you must give access with super aser 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:06.140
 will recharge will recharge the program 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:10.579
 as we expect to be go go as ngm 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.640
 you are beautiful here here once 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.519
 go here you have to go to recovery 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.579
 update eve will detect the recovery point 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.840
 image so therefore there is 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.300
 worry next month with the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.190
 Chinese who advise you to download but 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.650
 you have to download this quarry sets 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.419
 you put on the seats you see decorations in 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.509
 file sd card two then followed then 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.860
 if you try me , try them on 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:42.590
 let's see let's not show them 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.750
 as it is activated in cm then we turn off the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.580
 cvm as I said you have to go to the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:54.680
 up key and power key then we take 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:58.990
 t2 until it is switched on at 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.990
 screen with streep with the word ngm 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.460
 here now it had gone so vi 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:12.639
 we do when it won't turn on 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:15.610
 inscribed here it is here dynamic maxi new 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.729
 generation mobile 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.479
 here it is starting to ngm I was wrong 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.479
 admit it 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.710
 so that I advise you to always use 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.949
 that program I now to show you 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.470
 with the keys, however, with that program vi 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:42.770
 just and let the net the recovery will give you 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.630
 will give you the way to go with recovery 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.380
 so don't worry 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:58.840
 so now we go where he died 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:02.930
 pushing it turns off small errors 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.120
 now let's look forward to what it is anyway 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.890
 tell you this problem this program e 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.830
 only works for ngm dynamic maxi and vi 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.050
 I recommend making a backup to save yourself 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.160
 all just an example if a 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.529
 new firmware for ngm you will have i 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.679
 all here he will start 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:29.159
 and just now is also high this 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.879
 however notes go here there stÃ  

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.429
 no way 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:36.389
 you want to do that trent system or right 

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:39.269
 in order to come anyway now the code has not been released 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.849
 cvm written, however, under the first one 

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:44.939
 time it will come out then it doesn't come out anymore 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:48.409
 so I hope this video is there 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:51.659
 was useful in the company of our ngm 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.759

 press all key conditions into 

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:23.549

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:31.139
 do so ok and the real one will install 

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:33.449
 once done ok not the recovery barrels 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:36.929
 of me it requires the first time then 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:40.319
 we do ok and now you see that it will come out 

00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:45.209
 the cmc comes true in this screen 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:48.629
