it
I<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.319> me<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.650> my<00:02:14.680> opinion<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.400> feel<00:02:15.610> like<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
I for me in my opinion I feel like the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.960 
I for me in my opinion I feel like the
step<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.330> between<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.750> ps3<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> ps4<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.310> so

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
step up between the ps3 to the ps4 is so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.960 
step up between the ps3 to the ps4 is so
huge<00:02:19.450> now<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:20.050> more<00:02:20.830> more<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.220> towards<00:02:21.580> you

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
huge now if more more for towards you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.840 
huge now if more more for towards you
know<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> xbox<00:02:22.569> 360<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.230> Xbox<00:02:23.770> one<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.640> me

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
know the xbox 360 and Xbox one for me

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.730 
know the xbox 360 and Xbox one for me
that's<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.690> huge<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.230> difference<00:02:26.620> i

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
that's not that huge of a difference i

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.490 
that's not that huge of a difference i
mean<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> 500<00:02:27.819> megabytes<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.330> ram<00:02:28.600> vs<00:02:29.290> 8

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
mean it is 500 megabytes of ram vs 8

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.370 
mean it is 500 megabytes of ram vs 8
gigabytes<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.489> ram<00:02:30.700> which<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.000> 16<00:02:31.540> x<00:02:31.780> 500

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
gigabytes of ram which is 16 x 500

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.350 
gigabytes of ram which is 16 x 500
megabytes<00:02:32.800> which<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.730> course<00:02:33.760> being<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
megabytes which of course being on the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.540 
megabytes which of course being on the
xbox<00:02:34.750> one<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.110> newer<00:02:35.290> console<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.250> know<00:02:36.370> that

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
xbox one the newer console you know that

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.890 
xbox one the newer console you know that
I<00:02:36.580> surprisingly<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:37.660> think<00:02:37.780> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
I surprisingly you would think that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.540 
I surprisingly you would think that
would<00:02:38.080> make<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> really<00:02:38.530> huge<00:02:38.800> difference<00:02:39.340> but

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
would make a really huge difference but

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.699 
would make a really huge difference but
for<00:02:39.760> me<00:02:39.970> it's<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:41.050> not<00:02:41.170> making<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.560> big

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
for me it's really not making that big

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.110 
for me it's really not making that big
of<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.950> difference<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.400> don't<00:02:42.550> notice<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.940> huge

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
of a difference I don't notice a huge

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.240 
of a difference I don't notice a huge
difference<00:02:43.239> between<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.020> xbox<00:02:44.440> one<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
difference between the xbox one and the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.280 
difference between the xbox one and the
360<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.030> know<00:02:46.150> maybe<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.660> year<00:02:46.690> when<00:02:47.200> they

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
360 you know maybe in a year when they

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.630 
360 you know maybe in a year when they
really<00:02:47.530> figure<00:02:47.800> out<00:02:47.830> how<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.040> really<00:02:48.310> code

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
really figure out how to really code

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.270 
really figure out how to really code
awesomely<00:02:49.630> for<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.080> xbox<00:02:50.500> 1<00:02:50.739> i'll<00:02:50.920> be<00:02:51.040> able<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
awesomely for the xbox 1 i'll be able to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.830 
awesomely for the xbox 1 i'll be able to
notice<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.640> huge<00:02:51.790> difference<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.690> me

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
notice a huge difference but for me

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.330 
what I found the PlayStation 4 that the
graphics<00:04:23.140> are<00:04:23.289> better<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.710> faster<00:04:24.220> it's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
graphics are better it's faster it's

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.339 
graphics are better it's faster it's
smoother<00:04:24.909> the<00:04:25.300> network's<00:04:25.780> better<00:04:26.080> when<00:04:26.260> you

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
smoother the network's better when you

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.540 
smoother the network's better when you
pay<00:04:26.500> for<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.830> that's<00:04:27.190> just

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
pay for that that's just

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.680 
pay for that that's just
you're<00:04:27.699> gonna<00:04:27.789> get<00:04:28.030> when<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.270> pay<00:04:28.449> for<00:04:28.479> a

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
you're gonna get when you pay for a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.390 
you're gonna get when you pay for a
network<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:29.169> just<00:04:29.440> it's<00:04:30.039> going<00:04:30.159> to<00:04:30.280> be

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
network it's just it's going to be

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.350 
network it's just it's going to be
better<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.729> mean<00:04:30.940> they're<00:04:31.030> going<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.210> have<00:04:31.330> a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
better I mean they're going to have a

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.879 
better I mean they're going to have a
lot<00:04:31.629> more<00:04:31.659> money<00:04:31.990> for<00:04:32.169> servers<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.740> lot

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
lot more money for servers and a lot

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.529 
lot more money for servers and a lot
more<00:04:32.919> money<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.370> dedicate<00:04:33.940> into<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.330> network

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
more money to dedicate into the network

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.659 
more money to dedicate into the network
so<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.800> basically<00:04:36.129> how<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.370> works

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
so that's just basically how it works

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.279 
so that's just basically how it works
that's<00:04:36.849> why<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.090> think<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.449> ps4<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:38.050> so

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
that's why I think the ps4 is so

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.050 
that's why I think the ps4 is so
intensely<00:04:38.740> better<00:04:38.979> than<00:04:39.159> the<00:04:39.220> ps3<00:04:39.819> and<00:04:40.030> the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
intensely better than the ps3 and the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.270 
intensely better than the ps3 and the
xbox<00:04:40.780> one<00:04:41.020> really<00:04:41.379> isn't<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.770> much<00:04:41.949> better

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
xbox one really isn't that much better

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.879 
xbox one really isn't that much better
than<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.610> Xbox<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.810> xbox<00:04:44.229> 360<00:04:44.710> was

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
than the Xbox you know the xbox 360 was

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.680 
than the Xbox you know the xbox 360 was
already<00:04:45.159> pretty<00:04:45.310> fast<00:04:45.639> but<00:04:45.789> hopefully<00:04:46.599> you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
already pretty fast but hopefully you

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.969 
already pretty fast but hopefully you
