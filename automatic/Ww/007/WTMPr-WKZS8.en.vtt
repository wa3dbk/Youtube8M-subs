the<00:00:48.719> same<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.350> NBA<00:00:49.680> 2k16<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.079> NBA

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the same in NBA 2k16 as it was in NBA

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
the same in NBA 2k16 as it was in NBA
2k15<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:54.840> let's<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.370> big<00:00:56.610> news

2k15 but now let's go into the big news

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
2k15 but now let's go into the big news
of<00:00:57.000> tonight's<00:00:57.629> video<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> certainly

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of tonight's video and that is certainly

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.529 
of tonight's video and that is certainly
to<00:01:00.000> Kate<00:01:00.510> pro-am<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.070> seen<00:01:02.340> 2k<00:01:02.940> throwing

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to Kate pro-am we have seen 2k throwing

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020

out<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.960> hashtag<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.710> Twitter<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.880> all

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
out the hashtag on Twitter and we all

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
out the hashtag on Twitter and we all
guessed<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> pretty<00:01:07.140> much<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
guessed that it is pretty much going to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.030 
guessed that it is pretty much going to
be<00:01:07.890> something<00:01:08.549> similar<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.450> crew<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
be something similar to crew and it is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
be something similar to crew and it is
certainly<00:01:11.430> starting<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.210> sound<00:01:12.450> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
certainly starting to sound like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.620 
certainly starting to sound like
something<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.460> jrc<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
something that is like the jrc that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.800 
something that is like the jrc that
we've<00:01:15.780> seen<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.110> NBA<00:01:16.409> 2k15<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.330> few

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
playing at the same time now that part

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
playing at the same time now that part
of<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> paragraph<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:39.030> definitely<00:01:39.600> sounds

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
of the paragraph it definitely sounds

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.980 
of the paragraph it definitely sounds
like<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.320> jrc<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.640> moving<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.780> some

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
like the jrc but moving on we got some

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
like the jrc but moving on we got some
new<00:01:43.290> things<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.189> making<00:01:44.670> me<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.060> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
new things that are making me think that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.710 
new things that are making me think that
this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.380> less<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.700> crew<00:01:48.119> mode<00:01:48.450> as

this is more or less like a crew mode as

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.920 
this is more or less like a crew mode as
a<00:01:49.259> walk-on<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.430> compete<00:01:50.939> against<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> 2k

in<00:02:45.630> waiting<00:02:46.080> times<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.980> you're

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
in waiting times and that you're

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.880

actually going to get matchmaking that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.830 
actually going to get matchmaking that
is<00:02:50.070> certainly<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:50.820> I'm<00:02:50.940> hoping<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.720> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
is certainly what I'm hoping is going to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020 
is certainly what I'm hoping is going to
happen<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.739> at<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> end<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> day<00:02:53.610> one

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
happen but at the end of the day one

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.330 
happen but at the end of the day one
thing<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.630> still<00:02:55.020> worrying<00:02:55.650> me<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.130> this

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
thing that is still worrying me at this

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.400 
thing that is still worrying me at this
point<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.760> time<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.840> are<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
point in time is that we are going to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.250 
point in time is that we are going to
have<00:02:58.500> four<00:02:58.950> courts<00:02:59.550> out<00:02:59.700> there<00:03:00.150> 40<00:03:00.900> players

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
have four courts out there 40 players

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.710 
have four courts out there 40 players
playing<00:03:01.709> at<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.130> same<00:03:02.370> time<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.030> can

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
playing at the same time and that can

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.440 
playing at the same time and that can
definitely<00:03:04.320> cause<00:03:04.620> some<00:03:04.920> blackened<00:03:05.760> issues

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
definitely cause some blackened issues

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.140 
definitely cause some blackened issues
hopefully<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.709> not<00:03:07.739> going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.430> happen<00:03:08.670> in

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
hopefully it is not going to happen in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.530 
hopefully it is not going to happen in
