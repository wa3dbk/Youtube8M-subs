00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.850 

so<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:26.630> is<00:00:26.750> how<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.900> pistol<00:00:27.320> ships<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:27.740> you

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860

in this really inexpensive cardboard box

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.350 
in this really inexpensive cardboard box
nothing<00:00:30.680> fancy<00:00:31.250> a<00:00:31.280> little<00:00:31.640> bit<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.820> padding<00:00:32.000> in

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
nothing fancy a little bit of padding in

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.360 
nothing fancy a little bit of padding in
there<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:33.320> don't<00:00:33.500> get<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.680> pistol<00:00:33.950> carrying

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370

manual marks specifically for Wolverine

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.979 
manual marks specifically for Wolverine
supplies<00:00:49.580> so<00:00:50.239> these<00:00:50.420> pistols<00:00:50.840> are

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
supplies so these pistols are

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.410 
supplies so these pistols are
manufactured<00:00:51.739> for<00:00:51.980> Wolverine<00:00:52.460> supplies<00:00:52.820> they

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
manufactured for Wolverine supplies they

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.910 
manufactured for Wolverine supplies they
even<00:00:53.660> have<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:53.870> little<00:00:54.170> detail<00:00:54.530> here<00:00:54.739> in<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
even have a little detail here in the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.040 
even have a little detail here in the
safety<00:00:55.160> with<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.670> Wolverine<00:00:56.180> supplies<00:00:56.600> logo

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
safety with the Wolverine supplies logo

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.250 
safety with the Wolverine supplies logo
so<00:00:57.260> that's<00:00:57.410> kind<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.649> cool<00:00:57.970> but<00:00:58.989> moving<00:00:59.989> on<00:01:00.079> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
so that's kind of cool but moving on to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.500 
so that's kind of cool but moving on to
the<00:01:00.350> pistol<00:01:00.680> itself<00:01:01.090> fit<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.239> finish<00:01:02.480> is

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
the pistol itself fit and finish is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.290 
the pistol itself fit and finish is
excellent<00:01:03.729> considering<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.790> price<00:01:05.000> point

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
excellent considering the price point

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.359 
excellent considering the price point
they're<00:01:06.229> kind<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.560> in<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.770> ballpark<00:01:07.250> of

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
they're kind of in the ballpark of

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.210 
they're kind of in the ballpark of
Norinco<00:01:07.850> pricing<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:08.660> if<00:01:09.380> you<00:01:09.560> expect<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.100> get

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
Norinco pricing so if you expect to get

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920 
Norinco pricing so if you expect to get
Norinco<00:01:10.670> quality<00:01:11.180> you're<00:01:11.630> going<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.840> be

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
Norinco quality you're going to be

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.230 
Norinco quality you're going to be
pleasantly<00:01:12.380> surprised<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.759> lot

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
pleasantly surprised that it's a lot

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.279 
pleasantly surprised that it's a lot
better<00:01:14.740> these<00:01:15.740> pistols<00:01:16.610> have<00:01:17.289> excellent

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
better these pistols have excellent

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.940 
better these pistols have excellent
finishes<00:01:19.210> but<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:20.570> noticed<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.110> they<00:01:21.470> do

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
finishes but we noticed that they do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.490 
finishes but we noticed that they do
seem<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.580> maybe<00:01:22.940> prematurely<00:01:23.690> wear<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.229> little

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
seem to maybe prematurely wear a little

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.230 
seem to maybe prematurely wear a little
bit<00:01:24.680> they<00:01:24.860> come<00:01:25.009> from<00:01:25.399> factory<00:01:25.880> they<00:01:26.030> look

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
bit they come from factory they look

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.230 
bit they come from factory they look
excellent<00:01:26.539> beautiful<00:01:27.200> crisp<00:01:27.700> but<00:01:28.700> we've

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
excellent beautiful crisp but we've

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.230 
excellent beautiful crisp but we've
noticed<00:01:29.830> we<00:01:30.830> were<00:01:30.950> making<00:01:31.340> holsters<00:01:31.759> for<00:01:31.789> them

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
noticed we were making holsters for them

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.150 
noticed we were making holsters for them
so<00:01:32.720> they<00:01:32.869> may<00:01:33.050> have<00:01:33.140> received<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.890> little<00:01:34.009> bit

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
so they may have received a little bit

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.219 
so they may have received a little bit
more<00:01:34.340> wear<00:01:34.640> than<00:01:34.670> normal<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.509> there<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.899> where

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
more wear than normal but there is where

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.230 
more wear than normal but there is where
wear<00:01:36.679> marks<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> slide<00:01:37.490> already<00:01:37.729> as<00:01:38.090> well

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
wear marks on the slide already as well

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.440 
wear marks on the slide already as well
as<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.600> safety<00:01:39.039> but<00:01:40.039> other<00:01:40.250> than<00:01:40.459> that<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
as the safety but other than that the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.580 
as the safety but other than that the
fit<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.720> phenomenal<00:01:43.539> barely<00:01:44.539> any<00:01:44.750> slide<00:01:45.349> play

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
fit is phenomenal barely any slide play

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.490 
fit is phenomenal barely any slide play
at<00:01:45.709> all<00:01:46.209> it<00:01:47.209> matches<00:01:47.720> up<00:01:47.750> really<00:01:47.990> well<00:01:48.440> with

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
at all it matches up really well with

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.240 
at all it matches up really well with
the<00:01:48.800> frame<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:50.330> just<00:01:51.259> overall<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:51.860> looks<00:01:52.069> like

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the frame and just overall it looks like

a<00:01:52.280> high<00:01:52.520> quality<00:01:52.819> handgun<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.050> we're

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
a high quality handgun so we're

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.020

extremely happy with the fit and finish

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.630 
extremely happy with the fit and finish
from<00:01:56.300> these<00:01:56.479> pistols<00:01:57.310> specifically<00:01:58.310> at<00:01:58.429> that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
from these pistols specifically at that

point<00:02:01.030> one<00:02:02.030> thing<00:02:02.300> we<00:02:02.479> didn't<00:02:02.929> like<00:02:03.110> about<00:02:03.679> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
point one thing we didn't like about the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.350 
point one thing we didn't like about the
pistol<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.780> grips<00:02:06.369> they're<00:02:07.369> wooden<00:02:07.849> they

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
pistol is the grips they're wooden they

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.180 
pistol is the grips they're wooden they
don't<00:02:08.720> look<00:02:08.929> wooden<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.709> didn't<00:02:09.920> notice<00:02:10.130> it

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
don't look wooden and I didn't notice it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.150 
don't look wooden and I didn't notice it
until<00:02:10.250> after<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.840> part<00:02:12.349> of<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.770> grip

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
until after but a part of the grip

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.880 
until after but a part of the grip
chipped<00:02:13.910> off<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> little<00:02:14.450> bit<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:15.440> exposed

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
chipped off a little bit and it exposed

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.920 
chipped off a little bit and it exposed
that<00:02:16.160> they're<00:02:16.580> actually<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:16.940> wooden<00:02:17.450> wooden

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
that they're actually just wooden wooden

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.300 
that they're actually just wooden wooden
grips<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:18.650> probably<00:02:18.890> something<00:02:19.099> I'll

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
grips so that's probably something I'll

really good there's no tooling marks
which<00:04:33.870> really<00:04:34.320> surprised<00:04:34.770> me<00:04:34.890> because<00:04:35.130> that's

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
which really surprised me because that's

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.190 
which really surprised me because that's
normally<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.270> shortcut<00:04:36.630> for<00:04:36.840> most<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.140> the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
normally a shortcut for most of the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.320 
normally a shortcut for most of the
manufacturing<00:04:37.770> process<00:04:37.880> it's<00:04:38.880> just<00:04:39.120> kind<00:04:39.270> of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
manufacturing process it's just kind of

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.200 
manufacturing process it's just kind of
doing<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.630> rough<00:04:39.810> inside<00:04:40.260> but<00:04:40.979> this<00:04:41.729> pistol

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
doing a rough inside but this pistol

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.050 
doing a rough inside but this pistol
does<00:04:42.419> have<00:04:42.660> an<00:04:42.930> excellent<00:04:43.430> interior<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.940> the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
does have an excellent interior to the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.960 
does have an excellent interior to the
pistol<00:04:45.710> so<00:04:46.710> taking<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> range<00:04:47.580> and

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
pistol so taking it to the range and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.020 
pistol so taking it to the range and
tested<00:04:48.540> it<00:04:48.660> quite<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> few<00:04:49.080> times<00:04:49.380> now<00:04:49.650> and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
tested it quite a few times now and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.820 
tested it quite a few times now and
we've<00:04:51.030> found<00:04:51.390> some<00:04:51.900> things<00:04:52.140> we<00:04:52.350> like<00:04:52.500> about<00:04:52.650> it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
we've found some things we like about it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.409 
we've found some things we like about it
and<00:04:52.860> some<00:04:53.040> things<00:04:53.250> we<00:04:53.370> don't<00:04:53.490> like<00:04:53.610> about<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.090> I

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
and some things we don't like about it I

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.690 
and some things we don't like about it I
want<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.020> start<00:04:55.169> with<00:04:55.290> things<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.620> issues<00:04:56.520> we

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
want to start with things that issues we

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.930 
want to start with things that issues we
had<00:04:57.470> with<00:04:58.470> with<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.950> extractor<00:04:59.610> we<00:04:59.850> were

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
had with with the extractor we were

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.480 
had with with the extractor we were
having<00:05:00.150> extractor<00:05:00.720> issues<00:05:01.140> every<00:05:01.919> round<00:05:02.160> or

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
having extractor issues every round or

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.400 
having extractor issues every round or
not<00:05:02.580> every<00:05:02.850> round<00:05:03.030> but<00:05:03.180> every<00:05:03.720> other<00:05:03.870> round<00:05:04.140> or

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
not every round but every other round or

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.590 
not every round but every other round or
so<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.620> was<00:05:04.860> getting<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.729> extractor<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.450> was

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
so I was getting the extractor it was

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.490 
so I was getting the extractor it was
hitting<00:05:06.840> me<00:05:07.050> in<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.200> head<00:05:07.460> which<00:05:08.460> was<00:05:08.669> really

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
hitting me in the head which was really

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.290 
hitting me in the head which was really
distracting<00:05:10.500> if<00:05:10.650> you're<00:05:11.490> trying<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.060> shoot

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
distracting if you're trying to shoot

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.090 
distracting if you're trying to shoot
accurately<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:13.169> you're<00:05:13.320> kind<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:13.979> the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
accurately and you're kind of in the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.100 
accurately and you're kind of in the
zone<00:05:14.130> you're<00:05:14.729> zeroed<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.419> then<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:15.990> get

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
zone you're zeroed in and then you get

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.659 
zone you're zeroed in and then you get
hit<00:05:16.260> with<00:05:16.320> an<00:05:16.530> extractor<00:05:17.160> kind<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.460> throws

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
hit with an extractor kind of throws

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.159 
hit with an extractor kind of throws
your<00:05:17.820> psychie<00:05:18.210> off<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.570> was<00:05:18.810> kind<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.050> a

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
your psychie off so that was kind of a

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.650 
your psychie off so that was kind of a
major<00:05:19.380> issue<00:05:19.680> for<00:05:19.890> me<00:05:20.310> so<00:05:21.270> we're<00:05:21.390> gonna<00:05:21.450> have

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
major issue for me so we're gonna have

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.750 
major issue for me so we're gonna have
to<00:05:21.690> fix<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:22.039> but<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.190> was<00:05:23.310> an<00:05:23.430> accurate

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
to fix that but it was an accurate

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.540 
to fix that but it was an accurate
pistol<00:05:24.860> perfect<00:05:25.860> at<00:05:26.010> great<00:05:26.220> accuracy

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
pistol perfect at great accuracy

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.360 
pistol perfect at great accuracy
expected<00:05:27.210> from<00:05:27.360> this<00:05:27.510> 1911<00:05:28.100> but<00:05:29.100> another

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
expected from this 1911 but another

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.520 
expected from this 1911 but another
thing<00:05:29.640> we<00:05:29.789> noticed<00:05:30.150> was<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.990> trigger<00:05:31.260> was<00:05:31.500> a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
thing we noticed was the trigger was a

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.279 
thing we noticed was the trigger was a
little<00:05:31.890> heavy<00:05:32.160> for<00:05:32.340> a<00:05:32.370> 1911<00:05:33.140> 1911's<00:05:34.140> or

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
little heavy for a 1911 1911's or

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.620 
little heavy for a 1911 1911's or
typically<00:05:34.710> pretty<00:05:34.950> light<00:05:35.160> triggers<00:05:35.700> this<00:05:36.419> one

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
typically pretty light triggers this one

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.150 
typically pretty light triggers this one
was<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.840> little<00:05:37.080> bit<00:05:37.229> hit<00:05:37.560> on<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.830> heavy<00:05:38.039> side

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
was a little bit hit on the heavy side

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.460 
was a little bit hit on the heavy side
but<00:05:38.940> nothing<00:05:39.060> nothing<00:05:39.840> too<00:05:39.990> serious

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
but nothing nothing too serious

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.250 
but nothing nothing too serious
it<00:05:40.680> was<00:05:41.070> still<00:05:41.280> provided<00:05:41.729> great<00:05:41.940> accuracy<00:05:42.270> so

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
it was still provided great accuracy so

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.900 
it was still provided great accuracy so
it<00:05:43.410> did<00:05:43.650> really<00:05:43.890> well<00:05:44.070> at<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.280> range<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.820> were

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
it did really well at the range we were

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.850 
it did really well at the range we were
happy<00:05:45.240> other<00:05:45.450> than<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.840> extractor<00:05:46.440> issue<00:05:46.650> we

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
happy other than the extractor issue we

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.010 
happy other than the extractor issue we
were<00:05:46.950> experienced<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:48.450> at<00:05:48.570> that<00:05:48.720> price<00:05:48.900> point

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
were experienced but at that price point

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.850 
were experienced but at that price point
it's<00:05:49.530> such

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
it's such

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.589 
it's such
good<00:05:50.009> deal<00:05:50.250> that<00:05:50.280> don't<00:05:50.849> lead<00:05:51.030> we<00:05:51.330> weren't
