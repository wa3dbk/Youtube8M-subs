00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:13.420
 and before a group that will do something with 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.420
 your 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.420
 now 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.320
 carlitos look at my radioactive 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.620
 Today I bring two as house 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.420
 special guests because they're going to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.879
 help make the analysis of some 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.879
 videos a few videos 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.899
 some videos where the bukis come out 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.899
 First 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:29.110
 it's one of the first we're going to wait 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 here 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.369
 it seems to them 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.439
 here is the frame entry first 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.460
 antonio solís but leaves fast 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.460
 until the last good 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.350
 look 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.930
 really like that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.040
 pretty girl already burned 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:41.050
 because later I do not know how is that 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.670
 the earth 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.690
 oh what 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.460
 qatar that man must have good 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.570
 physical condition because not everyone 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.570
 I could do that 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.930
 as I would not do it in the first place I 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.930
 I would be very sorry to do it 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.030
 s 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.720
 your opinion about this video that he 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.720
 have to stop living 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.150
 but 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.959
 something very good very ridiculously 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:23.630
 and now video video the second video 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:30.260
 it is from the bukis unfortunately the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:32.950
 devil of the guitar but still 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.950
 there is the song 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.610
 and 1980 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.850
 and they are good 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.110
 we can see each other 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.110
 quiet members 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.620
 and here in this let's see how to 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.620
 of the tambourine he will be the devil 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.570
 starts 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.050
 and that devilish evil 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 hear 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.770
 hear 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:07.550
 You can hear the tambourine but I want 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.550
 say something 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.620
 it's good that these people who were 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.110
 doing 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.940
 the second brand that does not know why he 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.620
 it is known that the lead singer 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.000
 then when I'm not a 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.000
 main singer all 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.470
 7 my opinion that if someone can 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.660
 do something well they would buy it give the 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.430
 attention really because if I did not 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.889
 it would stop ball but now it has not been 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.889
 so for the photography story I think 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:13.630
 that everyone in their shows each asks 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.630
 make a madness now it's your turn 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:41.710
 marco antonio solís has always stood out 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.710
 for his look like that with long hair 

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:51.179
 and we go
