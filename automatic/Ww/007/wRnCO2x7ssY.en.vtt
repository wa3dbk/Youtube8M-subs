trick<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.520> noticed<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> years<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
trick I noticed over the years that a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
trick I noticed over the years that a
lot<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> kids<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:43.049> bar<00:01:43.290> spins<00:01:43.500> differently

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
lot of kids do bar spins differently

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
lot of kids do bar spins differently
some<00:01:44.520> people<00:01:44.790> don't<00:01:45.000> even<00:01:45.090> pinch<00:01:45.420> their<00:01:45.630> seat

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
some people don't even pinch their seat

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.780 
some people don't even pinch their seat
but<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.950> pinch<00:01:47.189> their<00:01:47.399> cranks

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
but what they do is pinch their cranks

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.730 
but what they do is pinch their cranks
if<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.360> left<00:01:48.570> foot<00:01:48.780> forward<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.470> drop

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
if your left foot forward and you drop

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
if your left foot forward and you drop
your<00:01:49.950> heel<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.460> pinch<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:50.939> cranks<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.360> then

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
your heel and pinch your cranks and then

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960 
your heel and pinch your cranks and then
your<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:52.020> foot<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.340> drop<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.700> toe

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
your right foot you just drop your toe

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.270 
your right foot you just drop your toe
and<00:01:54.210> pinch<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.020> cranks<00:01:55.439> it'll<00:01:55.950> keep<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and pinch your cranks it'll keep the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
and pinch your cranks it'll keep the
bike<00:01:56.460> stable<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.299> another<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
bike stable and that's another way of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.950 
bike stable and that's another way of
doing<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.920> bar<00:01:59.100> spin<00:01:59.450> before<00:02:00.450> trying<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
doing a bar spin before trying to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.719 
doing a bar spin before trying to
bunnyhop<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.920> try<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.430> mellow

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
bunnyhop I would try them on a mellow

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
bunnyhop I would try them on a mellow
wedge<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.240> it'll<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.630> more<00:02:03.810> comparable<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
wedge and it'll be more comparable to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
wedge and it'll be more comparable to
that<00:02:04.700> when<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.790> throw<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.119> bar<00:02:06.329> spins<00:02:06.600> if

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that when you throw in the bar spins if

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
that when you throw in the bar spins if
your<00:02:06.990> front<00:02:07.229> end<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.469> dropping<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.819> be

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
your front end is dropping that could be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
your front end is dropping that could be
two<00:02:09.119> things<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.989> could<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.289> throwing<00:02:10.679> your

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
two things you could be throwing your

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.309 
two things you could be throwing your
hands<00:02:11.039> down<00:02:11.459> towards<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> ground<00:02:12.209> or<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.140> can

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
hands down towards the ground or you can

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.910 
hands down towards the ground or you can
be<00:02:13.470> open

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
