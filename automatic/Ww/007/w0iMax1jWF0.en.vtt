00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
to move my mouse around the line which

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.970 
to move my mouse around the line which
is<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.430> top<00:04:35.640> of<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.940> building<00:04:36.300> now<00:04:37.110> when<00:04:37.860> you

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
is the top of the building now when you

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.220 
is the top of the building now when you
get<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.400> middle<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.970> little<00:04:39.720> square<00:04:39.930> next

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
get to the middle a little square next

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.980 
get to the middle a little square next
to<00:04:40.590> your<00:04:40.710> pencil<00:04:41.160> will<00:04:41.760> turn<00:04:41.970> blue<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.630> just

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
to your pencil will turn blue that just

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.230 
to your pencil will turn blue that just
means<00:04:43.200> you're<00:04:43.350> in<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.470> middle<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.970> then<00:04:45.120> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
means you're in the middle so then you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.930 
means you're in the middle so then you
can<00:04:45.420> click<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.960> drag<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.950> line<00:04:47.250> across<00:04:47.820> here

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
can click and drag a line across here

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.070 
can click and drag a line across here
and<00:04:48.980> then<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.790> click<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.300> end<00:04:51.510> of<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:51.780> point

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
and then you click the end of this point

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.440 
and then you click the end of this point
and<00:04:52.620> drag<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.190> across<00:04:53.250> here<00:04:53.640> now<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.880> can<00:04:54.030> keep

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
and drag it across here now you can keep

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.050 
and drag it across here now you can keep
on<00:04:54.750> moving<00:04:55.140> this<00:04:55.260> up<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.650> down<00:04:55.800> until<00:04:56.130> it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
on moving this up and down until it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.780 
on moving this up and down until it
stops<00:04:57.390> moving<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.080> little<00:04:58.260> bit<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:59.010> there's<00:04:59.730> a

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
stops moving a little bit and there's a

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.720 
stops moving a little bit and there's a
little<00:05:00.090> dotted<00:05:00.300> red<00:05:00.720> line<00:05:00.750> right<00:05:01.290> there<00:05:01.730> that

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
little dotted red line right there that

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.060 
little dotted red line right there that
means<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.270> it's<00:05:03.450> aligned<00:05:03.870> with<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:04.770> other

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
means that it's aligned with this other

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.270 
means that it's aligned with this other
point<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:05.760> these<00:05:05.910> two<00:05:06.210> points<00:05:06.420> are<00:05:06.660> aligned

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
point so these two points are aligned

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.140 
point so these two points are aligned
now<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:09.180> now<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:10.080> can<00:05:10.260> take<00:05:10.470> my<00:05:11.070> point<00:05:11.370> here<00:05:11.580> my

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
now so now you can take my point here my

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.260 
now so now you can take my point here my
pencil<00:05:12.570> click<00:05:13.230> right<00:05:13.440> here<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.980> drag<00:05:14.760> over<00:05:15.000> to

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
pencil click right here and drag over to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.450 
pencil click right here and drag over to
this<00:05:15.420> other<00:05:15.660> pointer<00:05:16.230> and<00:05:16.740> now<00:05:17.160> we<00:05:17.220> have<00:05:17.430> a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
this other pointer and now we have a

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.280 
this other pointer and now we have a
triangle<00:05:17.820> right<00:05:18.390> here<00:05:18.420> it's<00:05:18.750> sort<00:05:18.840> of<00:05:18.990> hard<00:05:19.140> to

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
triangle right here it's sort of hard to

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.760 
triangle right here it's sort of hard to
see<00:05:19.470> but<00:05:19.710> now<00:05:20.130> you've<00:05:21.120> made<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.930> totally

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
see but now you've made this totally

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.500 
see but now you've made this totally
separate<00:05:23.190> surface<00:05:23.580> and<00:05:23.850> this<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.030> totally

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
separate surface and this a totally

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.470 
separate surface and this a totally
separate<00:05:24.870> surface<00:05:25.350> so<00:05:26.220> we<00:05:26.400> can<00:05:26.580> pull<00:05:27.030> this

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
separate surface so we can pull this

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.990 
separate surface so we can pull this
back<00:05:27.930> with<00:05:28.560> push-pull<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:32.010> we<00:05:32.280> can<00:05:32.460> pull<00:05:32.700> this

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
back with push-pull and we can pull this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.190 
back with push-pull and we can pull this
back<00:05:33.390> with<00:05:33.720> push-pull<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.180> is<00:05:39.510> such<00:05:39.900> a

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
back with push-pull and that is such a

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.650 
back with push-pull and that is such a
nice<00:05:40.530> house<00:05:40.919> now<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.520> don't<00:05:42.180> like<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.510> material

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
nice house now I don't like the material

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.250 
nice house now I don't like the material
we<00:05:43.260> used<00:05:43.470> for<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.860> roof<00:05:44.070> so<00:05:44.970> click<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:46.020> paint

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
we used for the roof so click the paint

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.940 
we used for the roof so click the paint
bucket<00:05:47.390> go<00:05:48.390> down<00:05:48.600> here<00:05:48.990> here's<00:05:49.350> sort<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.830> a

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
bucket go down here here's sort of a

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.070 
bucket go down here here's sort of a
shingle<00:05:50.520> actually<00:05:51.210> there's<00:05:51.600> a<00:05:51.690> separate

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
shingle actually there's a separate

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.680 
shingle actually there's a separate
thing<00:05:52.410> called<00:05:52.680> roofing<00:05:53.240> let's<00:05:54.240> just<00:05:54.450> use

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
thing called roofing let's just use

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.480 
thing called roofing let's just use
standard<00:05:55.669> shingles<00:05:56.669> for<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.090> roof<00:05:57.950> let's<00:05:58.950> use

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:21.550 

some<00:06:02.490> skin<00:06:02.910> for<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.360> outside<00:06:03.720> of<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.990> house

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.450 

so<00:06:22.560> on<00:06:22.889> this<00:06:23.039> side<00:06:23.310> we<00:06:23.340> haven't<00:06:23.729> drawn<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.210> line

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
so on this side we haven't drawn a line

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.279 
so on this side we haven't drawn a line
across<00:06:26.460> these<00:06:26.880> two<00:06:27.120> points<00:06:27.539> so<00:06:27.660> we<00:06:27.780> want<00:06:28.020> to<00:06:28.110> do

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
across these two points so we want to do

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.070 
across these two points so we want to do
this<00:06:28.470> and<00:06:29.039> now<00:06:29.880> that's<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.449> separate<00:06:30.810> surface

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
this and now that's a separate surface

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.230 
this and now that's a separate surface
so<00:06:31.979> we<00:06:32.280> can<00:06:32.460> take<00:06:32.780> let's<00:06:33.780> use<00:06:34.020> this<00:06:34.380> for<00:06:35.250> now

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
so we can take let's use this for now

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.040 
so we can take let's use this for now
that<00:06:36.509> looks<00:06:36.750> dumb<00:06:37.349> let's<00:06:38.250> use<00:06:38.430> this<00:06:38.930> for<00:06:39.930> the

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
that looks dumb let's use this for the

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.480 
that looks dumb let's use this for the
sides<00:06:40.349> of<00:06:40.650> the<00:06:40.770> roof<00:06:42.050> now<00:06:43.050> I<00:06:43.410> would<00:06:44.039> show<00:06:44.280> you<00:06:44.340> a

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
sides of the roof now I would show you a

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.450 
sides of the roof now I would show you a
lot<00:06:44.849> more<00:06:45.150> but<00:06:46.139> these<00:06:46.349> are<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:46.590> basics<00:06:47.039> so

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
lot more but these are the basics so

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.330 
lot more but these are the basics so
this<00:06:47.699> is<00:06:47.880> lesson<00:06:48.300> 1<00:06:48.690> of<00:06:48.990> how<00:06:49.620> to<00:06:49.680> use<00:06:49.889> Google

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
this is lesson 1 of how to use Google
