I've<00:01:48.359> been<00:01:48.389> going<00:01:49.020> through<00:01:49.049> cookbooks<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
I've been going through cookbooks and

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.169 
I've been going through cookbooks and
figuring<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.609> different<00:01:50.819> because

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
figuring out how it's different because

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.510 
figuring out how it's different because
pancake<00:01:51.659> recipes<00:01:52.020> wrong<00:01:52.229> very<00:01:53.039> much<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> same

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
pancake recipes wrong very much the same

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.239 
pancake recipes wrong very much the same
with<00:01:53.729> few<00:01:53.939> variations<00:01:54.209> is<00:01:54.810> shortening<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
with few variations is shortening of

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.160 
with few variations is shortening of
course<00:01:56.639> I<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.060> never<00:01:57.240> forget<00:01:57.599> shortening

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
course I would never forget shortening

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.719 
course I would never forget shortening

more sweet and more more moist than the

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.200 
more sweet and more more moist than the
