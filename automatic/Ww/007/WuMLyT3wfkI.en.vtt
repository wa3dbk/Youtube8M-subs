00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
all on the first stage well I suppose

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.910 
all on the first stage well I suppose
it's<00:00:37.879> kind<00:00:38.059> of<00:00:38.120> second<00:00:38.659> stage<00:00:38.900> even<00:00:39.830> though

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's kind of second stage even though

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.880 
it's kind of second stage even though
it's<00:00:40.040> called<00:00:40.280> light<00:00:40.640> or<00:00:40.820> 01<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.290> yeah<00:00:42.470> this<00:00:42.680> way

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
it's called light or 01 so yeah this way

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.039 
it's called light or 01 so yeah this way
you're<00:00:43.040> going<00:00:43.159> to<00:00:43.190> find<00:00:43.400> the<00:00:43.820> first<00:00:44.570> civilian

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
and also this is definitely the easiest

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.469 
and also this is definitely the easiest
naturally<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.519> others<00:00:49.790> can<00:00:50.150> be<00:00:50.299> a<00:00:50.330> little
