00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
okay I think that stick is gonna be
right<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.600> kind<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.990> punch<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
right about here so you kind of punch a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
right about here so you kind of punch a
hole<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.820> sort<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.240> press<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.509> feel<00:01:42.930> on

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hole you can sort of press and feel on

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
hole you can sort of press and feel on
it<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.829> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> hard<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> tell<00:01:44.460> exactly

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it but it's kind of hard to tell exactly

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
it but it's kind of hard to tell exactly
where<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.090> edges<00:01:45.509> are<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.049> anyway<00:01:46.920> that'll<00:01:47.610> be

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
where the edges are so anyway that'll be

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.069 
where the edges are so anyway that'll be
my<00:01:47.820> next<00:01:47.850> trick

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.740 

there's<00:01:53.979> real<00:01:54.189> high-tech<00:01:54.549> scientific<00:01:55.210> stuff

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
there's real high-tech scientific stuff

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.969 
there's real high-tech scientific stuff
here<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.109> have<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.350> take<00:01:56.530> precise

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
here you have to take precise

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.649 
here you have to take precise
measurements<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.759> use<00:01:57.969> a<00:01:58.390> professional

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
measurements and use a professional

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.660 
measurements and use a professional
implement<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.649> order<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.950> do<00:02:00.070> this<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.460> can't

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
implement in order to do this you can't

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.100 
implement in order to do this you can't
do<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:00.969> with<00:02:01.149> just<00:02:01.329> any<00:02:01.479> old<00:02:01.659> screwdriver

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
do this with just any old screwdriver

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:25.680 
do this with just any old screwdriver
and<00:02:02.289> hammer<00:02:19.500> see<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:22.379> there<00:02:23.379> is<00:02:24.690> it's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
and hammer see there it is there is it's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.960 
and hammer see there it is there is it's
one<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:25.989> three<00:02:26.230> handed<00:02:26.799> operations<00:02:27.670> here

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970
