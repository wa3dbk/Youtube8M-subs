00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.450 

hello<00:00:13.879> guys<00:00:14.150> how's<00:00:14.599> it<00:00:14.690> going<00:00:15.019> out<00:00:15.139> there<00:00:15.460> just

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
hello guys how's it going out there just

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.269 
hello guys how's it going out there just
quickly<00:00:16.880> I<00:00:17.119> want<00:00:17.420> to<00:00:17.480> show<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:18.230> really<00:00:18.949> neat

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
quickly I want to show you a really neat

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.330 
quickly I want to show you a really neat
trick<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:19.699> can<00:00:19.730> do<00:00:19.939> a<00:00:19.970> dry<00:00:20.240> ice<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:21.099> this<00:00:22.099> is

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
trick you can do a dry ice and this is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.960 
trick you can do a dry ice and this is
actually<00:00:22.849> a<00:00:22.880> science<00:00:23.360> experiment<00:00:23.810> because

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
actually a science experiment because

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.029 
actually a science experiment because
the<00:00:25.970> way<00:00:26.210> that<00:00:26.509> dry<00:00:26.750> ice<00:00:26.930> works<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.680> that<00:00:27.710> of

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
the way that dry ice works is that of

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.609 
the way that dry ice works is that of
course<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.340> compressed<00:00:28.849> carbon<00:00:29.149> dioxide<00:00:29.809> now

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
course is compressed carbon dioxide now

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.650 
course is compressed carbon dioxide now
you<00:00:30.680> know<00:00:30.980> helium<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:32.149> know<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:32.390> reason<00:00:32.630> why

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
you know helium you know the reason why

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.130 
you know helium you know the reason why
helium<00:00:33.230> balloon<00:00:33.559> Rises<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.640> because<00:00:35.140> helium

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
helium balloon Rises is because helium

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.530 
helium balloon Rises is because helium
is<00:00:36.290> lighter<00:00:36.320> than<00:00:36.620> air<00:00:36.920> well<00:00:37.550> carbon<00:00:38.149> dioxide

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
is lighter than air well carbon dioxide

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.990 
is lighter than air well carbon dioxide
is<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:38.840> opposite<00:00:39.379> now<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.219> not<00:00:40.399> as<00:00:40.579> heavy<00:00:40.730> as

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
is the opposite now it's not as heavy as

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.410 
is the opposite now it's not as heavy as
other<00:00:41.210> gases<00:00:41.750> but<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.920> heavier<00:00:43.420> generally

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
other gases but is heavier generally

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.870 
other gases but is heavier generally
than<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.719> air<00:00:44.930> around<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:46.550> does<00:00:46.700> this

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
than the air around it what does this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.870 
than the air around it what does this
mean<00:00:47.620> this<00:00:48.620> means<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.010> basically<00:00:49.220> you<00:00:49.730> can

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
mean this means that basically you can

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.760 
mean this means that basically you can
take<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.500> bubble<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:52.430> is<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.820> your<00:00:53.030> typical

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
take a bubble that is of your typical

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.040 
take a bubble that is of your typical
atmosphere<00:00:54.770> where<00:00:55.040> you<00:00:55.250> are<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.870> blow<00:00:56.870> it

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
atmosphere where you are and blow it

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.290 
atmosphere where you are and blow it
into<00:00:57.260> carbon<00:00:57.800> dioxide<00:00:57.950> and<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.880> bubble<00:00:59.210> will

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
into carbon dioxide and the bubble will

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.930 
into carbon dioxide and the bubble will
float<00:00:59.540> you<00:01:00.410> don't<00:01:00.620> believe<00:01:00.829> me<00:01:01.040> let<00:01:01.640> me<00:01:01.730> show

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
float you don't believe me let me show

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.049 
float you don't believe me let me show
you<00:01:02.170> this<00:01:03.170> is<00:01:03.380> a<00:01:03.410> cooler<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:04.670> I'm<00:01:04.850> showing

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
you this is a cooler that I'm showing

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.120 
you this is a cooler that I'm showing
you<00:01:05.180> right<00:01:05.449> now<00:01:05.659> at<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.710> bottom<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
you right now at the bottom of the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.109 
you right now at the bottom of the
cooler<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.520> your<00:01:07.670> some<00:01:07.820> dry<00:01:08.000> ice<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:10.119> dry

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
cooler is your some dry ice and so dry

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.969 
cooler is your some dry ice and so dry
ice<00:01:11.329> pretty<00:01:11.630> much<00:01:11.810> like<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.110> said<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.439> slowly

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
ice pretty much like I said it slowly

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.980 
ice pretty much like I said it slowly
melts<00:01:13.549> but<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.790> course<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:14.180> never<00:01:14.390> see<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.750> melt

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
melts but of course we never see it melt

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.569 
melts but of course we never see it melt
because<00:01:15.170> its<00:01:15.469> carbon<00:01:15.649> dioxide<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.399> goes

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
because its carbon dioxide so it goes

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.120 
because its carbon dioxide so it goes
directly<00:01:17.540> from<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.870> lip<00:01:18.049> from<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.560> solid<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.040> a

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
directly from a lip from a solid to a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.380 
directly from a lip from a solid to a
gas<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:20.860> what<00:01:21.860> happens<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:23.060> end<00:01:23.240> up

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
gas and what happens is that we end up

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.640 
gas and what happens is that we end up
getting<00:01:23.690> carbon<00:01:23.990> dioxide<00:01:24.380> which<00:01:24.530> is

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
getting carbon dioxide which is

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.219 
getting carbon dioxide which is
invisible<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.790> let<00:01:26.030> me<00:01:26.060> show<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:26.570> what<00:01:27.110> it

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
invisible but let me show you what it

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.800 
invisible but let me show you what it
actually<00:01:27.409> does<00:01:30.130> if<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:32.450> look<00:01:32.600> at<00:01:32.720> these

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
actually does if you look at these

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.830 
actually does if you look at these
bubbles<00:01:33.880> you'll<00:01:34.880> see<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.210> they<00:01:35.330> float<00:01:35.570> let

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
bubbles you'll see that they float let

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.220 
bubbles you'll see that they float let
me<00:01:35.930> give<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.260> few<00:01:36.470> more

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.420 

and<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.320> course<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.770> bubbles<00:01:43.130> hit<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
and of course of the bubbles hit the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.930 
and of course of the bubbles hit the
side<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:45.530> cooler<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:46.400> they<00:01:46.580> end<00:01:46.790> up

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
side of this cooler then they end up

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.920 
side of this cooler then they end up
actually<00:01:47.770> popping<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:49.700> it's<00:01:50.420> just<00:01:50.630> something

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
actually popping but it's just something

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.510 
actually popping but it's just something
pretty<00:01:51.110> cool<00:01:51.350> another<00:01:51.980> thing<00:01:52.190> you'll<00:01:52.340> notice

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
pretty cool another thing you'll notice

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.280 
pretty cool another thing you'll notice
is<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:53.000> bubbles<00:01:53.390> will<00:01:53.480> slowly<00:01:53.930> go<00:01:54.260> down

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
is that the bubbles will slowly go down

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.700 
is that the bubbles will slowly go down
and<00:01:54.860> as<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.400> air<00:01:55.580> gets<00:01:55.820> cooler<00:01:56.560> once<00:01:57.560> again

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
and as the air gets cooler once again

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.230 
and as the air gets cooler once again
just<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.250> physics<00:01:59.120> effect<00:01:59.450> hotter<00:02:00.260> air<00:02:00.560> is

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
just the physics effect hotter air is

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.170 
just the physics effect hotter air is
more<00:02:02.240> buoyant<00:02:02.690> than<00:02:02.900> cooler<00:02:03.650> air<00:02:03.980> so<00:02:04.730> as<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
more buoyant than cooler air so as the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.440 
more buoyant than cooler air so as the
air<00:02:05.330> cools<00:02:05.360> off<00:02:05.930> then<00:02:06.860> they'll<00:02:07.250> slowly<00:02:07.550> sink

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
air cools off then they'll slowly sink

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.370 
air cools off then they'll slowly sink
down<00:02:11.830> but<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.100> I<00:02:13.220> said<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:15.260> have

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
down but like I said as you see we have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.960 
down but like I said as you see we have
a<00:02:15.440> pretty<00:02:15.680> cool<00:02:15.980> thing<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:16.250> because<00:02:16.670> what

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
a pretty cool thing here because what

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.750 
a pretty cool thing here because what
was<00:02:17.660> actually<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:18.020> on<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:19.520> have<00:02:19.640> an

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
was actually going on is that we have an

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.630 
was actually going on is that we have an
invisible<00:02:20.300> layer<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:21.410> carbon<00:02:21.890> dioxide<00:02:22.040> you

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
invisible layer of carbon dioxide you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.100 
invisible layer of carbon dioxide you
saw<00:02:22.880> those<00:02:23.030> bubbles<00:02:23.600> joined<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
saw those bubbles joined in the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.930 
saw those bubbles joined in the
background<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.860> pretty<00:02:25.310> cool<00:02:25.490> things<00:02:25.730> can

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
background so pretty cool things can
