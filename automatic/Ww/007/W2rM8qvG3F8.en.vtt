00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.770
 or let's all a slavia we are here in 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.360
 another video of dragon ball but bears in 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 this occasion and taking advantage of what 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.190
 little bit the ddc of dragon ball gt 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 part 1 I'm going to show you how to get 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.590
 the most powerful attack of this dlc that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 It is the super energy pump 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.930
 I already got could not record 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.150
 the moment I got it but here 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.330
 is the energy form special attack and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.240
 at the same time we also have the flower pot 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.650
 this ability that is to equip 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.199
 increases the power of your program 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.210
 energy and increases enough to say and 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.179
 also while it is active you will not receive 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.129
 damage which we can throw them as 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.350
 calm possible without worrying about 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.359
 that hurt us 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.089
 this is going to go to missions 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.100
 secondary or directly I will move to 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.980
 a recording that I have in the game 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 where will I apply what are the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.710
 Requirements 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.880
 you have to have all the conditions 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.220
 hidden to be able to obtain is 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.480
 this afternoon stability then we are going to 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.970
 go directly to the next part 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.310
 probably notice some change in me 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.630
 voice but I'll be cutting the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.780
 gameplay so that they do not get so 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.400
 long 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 good we are taking that would come to be 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 the next part of the video that we're 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.110
 losing against trans and goku bread for 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.450
 get stability they need 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.909
 unlock the hidden conditions and the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.880
 first of them is going to be thinking something 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.880
 whose log before we logically escape 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.909
 I usually choose weak partners 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 because the artificial intelligence of my 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.590
 allies and also that of the enemies is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 a little silly in this fight and many 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.190
 sometimes I end up using an attack 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.200
 final and bread was put me in the middle 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.200
 and I ended up killing 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.659
 once they 're hitting goku 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.130
 when they lower the orange bar it goes to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.130
 transform into super saiyan 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.160
 if they see that I lowered them in the bar 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.800
 orange and it's taking a long time to follow 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.870
 taking off accumulating like that is going to 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.750
 help cook a good time 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.170
 once they defeat transformed goku 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.610
 Super Saiyan and is trans to escape 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.250
 they are going to raise these two again 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.830
 enemies in super saiyan 3 and trance the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.380
 super saiyans and there you can defeat 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.300
 the peace 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.870
 once they defeat the three enemies 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.209
 again 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.150
 is going to get up again this time as 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.819
 super saiyan 4 and once you see it sans 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.760
 and are lucky enough I repeat 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.500
 as I said before it is very contains a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 very low percentage of getting 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.040
 stability but capable of one what 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.660
 get in the first others to the third 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.000
 statute of the afternoon 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.190
 now is about 12 20 30 tries 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.890
 attempts I do not know more or less this amount 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.450
 of attempts 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.950
 basically that's the way 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.900
 get her be careful with goku that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.240
 hits very strong especially if you chose to 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.880
 weak mates probably too 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.459
 they have moving their companions then 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.650
 be careful with this good guys eps 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.780
 and he served them and he liked it like 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.280
 please help us very much subscribe 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.810
 you can still see content from 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.640
 dragon ball if not bears we are 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.640
