00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.370
 and I love a few videos ago, no 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.280
 agreements and by the coll of may June 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.039
 April the new agreement is to teach 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 this lipstick that is super nice is 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.500
 a purple color that on the tube for this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.759
 purple guy very difficult to wear but 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 the truth is that how are your lips 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.990
 as it leads now it does not seem at all 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.759
 model has a little more to pink and I 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 love this color of gray and now 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.269
 we can change is to leave the comments 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 I would like you to do a look at the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.930
 that you wear these lips for more or less 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.550
 see how you can like to combine 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.920
 I know that this type of makeup is a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.170
 little strong but see it I made it a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.880
 little to go out at night to a party or 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.460
 for a special occasion you can also 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.980
 put the natural ak type day and the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.840
 strong lips I think they are very 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.180
 nice but I wanted to do something a little 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.190
 more exciting so look at this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.110
 look and I loved the result 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.340
 end tell me what you think I know it's a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 lot of makeup that we're going to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
 put a lot of makeup every day 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 but for a special occasion or for 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.259
 continue at night or I know what to see 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.280
 If it looks very nice and it is not 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.960
 kind of culinary art style 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.119
 and tell me the comments if you like 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.159
 this look if you would take it or if 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.229
 you think it 's too strong I do not know what 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.610
 you think and if you want to see how it looks 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.080
 keep watching 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.690
 The first thing I'm going to do is use 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.490
 a shadow in elf cream and it's like a 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.780
 very nice bronze color and I'm going to 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.580
 Simply put on the entire eyelid 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.180
 mobile and I'm going to start blurring 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 with the fingers 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.470
 I will also explain the same color in 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.460
 the bottom part of the eyelashes equal 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.460
 blur with your fingers 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.229
 all the colors that I will use are 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.300
 from the naked palette 1 of urban the cake and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.390
 all have a background like burgundy 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.710
 purple are very nice the first 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.050
 color that I'm going to use is called 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.940
 toaster and I'm going to put on all the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.720
 mobile eyelid and also in the part of 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.720
 down the lashes 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.630
 the next color that I'm going to use is 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 called jasso and I'm going to put it on 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.830
 eye basin and on the outside 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.340
 of the eye on the ub and I'm going to start 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.340
 blur 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.819
 I'm applying the color to touch 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.730
 because I want it to be pretty color 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.530
 powerful and then I'm already blurring 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.049
 little by little I have seen that the brush the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.269
 I had a little dirty with too much 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.650
 shadow and I was going to spoil a little the 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.390
 blurred so I 've cleaned it a 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.390
 little in my hand and I keep blurring 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.670
 now I am depositing a little bit more 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.069
 of the same color 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.870
 on the outside of the eye in the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.760
 corner on the ub and just me what 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.230
 I'm putting in this little piece 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.739
 so that the color is a bit more 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.739
 powerful 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.290
 the next color that I'm going to use is 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.269
 call sing and I'm going to put it in the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.500
 inner part of the eye in the lacrimal and 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.500
 both above and below 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.849
 The next thing I'm going to do is take the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.860
 shadow jasón the darkest and with a 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.989
 small chiquitita brush I'm going to 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.220
 delineate me the tabs above and 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.470
 this is all he's going to do is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.120
 look like we have more tabs and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.480
 slightly obscure line of 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.480
 tabs 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.130
 ah 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.879
 for this look that you have decided to use 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.590
 a brown eyeliner because I thought 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.900
 that the black was going to be too strong 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.519
 and I really like how this color looks 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.650
 brown with the shadows we have 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.719
 used and I was supposed to delineate 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.230
 in the water line below and the line 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.459
 of water above 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.459
 as in the tear 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.120
 Now I'm putting on a beige color 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.560
 clarito mate under the eyebrows you can 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.810
 use any mixture that 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.370
 you have and I'm using my mask 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.310
 favorite tabs that the return to 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.890
 buy that is volume 2000 in hd 's 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.360
 l'oréal and I love I love me 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.980
 love this mascara 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.030
 it seems that it separates you super well 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.610
 lashes gives you volume and gives you other 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.560
 much much longer eyelashes 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.180
 and I 'm getting mascara 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.989
 both in the tabs above and the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.989
 tabs below 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.900
 now I'm filling my eyebrows and 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:29.030
 color that I usually use is called back 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 from the naked palette 1 of urban of what 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 and now we have finished with the eyes 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.290
 and let's start with the face first thing 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.050
 What I'm going to do is put myself in my 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.810
 sonia kayak corrector legend and I 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.230
 I 'm putting it right below the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.730
 eyes in the dark circles part I like 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.340
 spread the little touches because I think 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.870
 it is much more natural the following 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.880
 What I'm going to do is put on my suntan lotion 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.800
 and I'm using the de of bound that is 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.180
 which I like the most because it's a bit 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.190
 matte but at the same time has a bit of 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.110
 shine I do not know I do not know how to explain it but 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.300
 It's very beautiful and I'm putting it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.130
 on the cheekbones and start blurring me 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.810
 I also like to wear it a bit in the 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.590
 front on the bridge of the nose and a 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.590
 little chin 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.260
 and now to finish I'll use my 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.050
 purple lipstick of Maybelline and me 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.030
 love this color is super easy to 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.880
 to wear is super comfortable because it 's like that 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.470
 creamy and if you like I advise you in 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.180
 serious 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.510
 and this is the final result that you 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.510
 It seems 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.990
 when you're done with today's 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.030
 I hope you liked the truth 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.710
 that at the beginning I did not buy it 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.509
 lipstick I thought I was not going to 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.120
 unite I was never going to be able to put 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.650
 because it's a little weird about the tube but 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.300
 the truth is that we are beautiful as 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.759
 You can see at least I love it 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.009
 and I recommend you a lot are super 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.680
 creamy and I do not know I love this color 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.720
 so do not forget to put life 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.530
 style rookie to subscribe, let's save the 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.530
 next to stick
