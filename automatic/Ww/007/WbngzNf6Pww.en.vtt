00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.540
 good friends how were we that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.540
 learn from him 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.619
 ah 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.840
 and then another point another slavery that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.070
 in which 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.370
 ah 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:46.730
 I do not know whether to say it but I have felt 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:52.240
 well for almost all my life 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:55.260
 and is to be a slave to your own belief 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.260
 and your thoughts 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.790
 who does not believe as the one who believes believes in 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.370
 the two who believe or do not think so of 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 simple and this is not something that 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:15.670
 invention is that it is pure and hard logic 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.900
 pure and simple logic in this matter of the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.640
 beliefs and thinking and in this 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.460
 you are a slave because sometimes the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:33.940
 concepts sometimes what they have gotten us 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.860
 in the coconut speaking vulgarly what 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.229
 they have put us in the brain or what you 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.130
 you've gotten into the brain is what has 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 stuck in the brain 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 that often does not let us be free 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.320
 of maybe looking for another level of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.720
 thought has locked us in a 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.170
 little box all the knowledge 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.430
 which is the one that will manage your life here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.940
 Stuck in a locked drawer 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.990
 his keys 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.550
 of belief this is what you have to 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.200
 think about what I think I have 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.140
 what to think and I close it and throw the key 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.770
 at the bottom of the river 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.550
 and there's no more mental growth 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.819
 slave of my spiritual growth 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.740
 own beliefs and thoughts and 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.660
 you will know the truth and the truth will make you 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.310
 truly free and I say 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 yes with your beliefs with my beliefs 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.490
 with what you read here I am 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.110
 directing a little more perhaps to the 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.110
 a little more religious tendency 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.150
 with all that sacrifice sacrifice your 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.220
 life 'you sacrifice your money you sacrifice your 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.680
 youth 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.150
 you sacrifice everything for a belief 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.230
 religious or a thought that you think that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.920
 is making you be free 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.940
 and you keep having the other slavery 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.810
 resentment appearances and what 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.540
 material 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.940
 where is that true free mind yes 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.690
 with all one 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.690
 you have sacrificed 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.750
 Done with good will with effort 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.590
 sacrificial families sacrifice many 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.840
 things for a belief that is good or 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.290
 bad but a belief that you have 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.310
 decided to be a slave to that belief and 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.450
 suddenly you realize you're not 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.700
 truly free because you continue with 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.969
 the spirit of resentment that of the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.980
 appearances and the material and this what 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.540
 I see in all the religious also 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 I see it in those who are not religious 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.819
 if your thinking and your belief makes you 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.340
 be free 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.379
 it has to be truly free 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.170
 and be free from your own bondage 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.310
 because we said there is not no 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.750
 worse bondage than being a slave to you 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.100
 same 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.389
 love yourself 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.640
 share appreciate what you have 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:34.390
 your family your friends health 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:39.010
 appreciate the daily possibilities 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:43.050
 to be better every day I want to encourage that 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.319
 your power is unlimited 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.280
 your power will take you where you want to go 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:54.840
 but first you must break with the 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:59.750
 mental and emotional shackles that you 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.750
 do I do not really know who you are
