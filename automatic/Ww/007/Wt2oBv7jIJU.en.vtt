black clamp and then the top one is a
silver<00:04:49.430> clamp<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:50.419> can<00:04:50.570> pop<00:04:50.750> those<00:04:50.930> off

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
silver clamp you can pop those off

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.190 
silver clamp you can pop those off
without<00:04:51.410> disconnecting<00:04:52.040> AC<00:04:52.550> if<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.990> have<00:04:54.169> a

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
without disconnecting AC if you have a

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.659 
without disconnecting AC if you have a
recovery<00:04:54.590> machine<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.340> can<00:04:55.520> actually

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
recovery machine you can actually

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.300 
recovery machine you can actually
disconnect<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.419> AC<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:56.870> do<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.290> way<00:04:57.350> but

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
disconnect the AC and do it that way but

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.990 
disconnect the AC and do it that way but
if<00:04:58.490> not<00:04:58.669> you<00:04:59.570> know<00:04:59.720> that's<00:04:59.960> why<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:04.640> slid<00:05:04.910> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
if not you know that's why you slid the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.960 
if not you know that's why you slid the
back<00:05:05.180> -<00:05:05.600> back<00:05:05.930> enough<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:08.050> get<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.200> loose<00:05:09.380> to

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
back - back enough to get it loose to

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.290 
back - back enough to get it loose to
where<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.450> could<00:05:12.070> get<00:05:13.070> today<00:05:13.340> you'd<00:05:14.030> be<00:05:14.150> get

where you could get today you'd be get

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.909 
where you could get today you'd be get
out<00:05:14.390> of<00:05:14.540> sunlight<00:05:14.840> yeah<00:05:15.110> so<00:05:15.500> we<00:05:15.590> can<00:05:15.680> get<00:05:15.770> to

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
out of sunlight yeah so we can get to

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.530 
out of sunlight yeah so we can get to
the<00:05:16.010> core<00:05:16.600> alright<00:05:17.600> there's<00:05:18.410> another<00:05:18.710> screw
