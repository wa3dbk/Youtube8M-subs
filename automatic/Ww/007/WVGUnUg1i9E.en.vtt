00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
90 some ninety percent of them so this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.400 
90 some ninety percent of them so this
was<00:02:56.580> done<00:02:56.820> their<00:02:57.720> part<00:02:57.750> from<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.170> very

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
was done their part from a very

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.790

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
strategic point of view of course it is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.890 
strategic point of view of course it is
and<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.250> fact<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.239> really<00:03:03.690> wasn't

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and in fact it's it it really wasn't

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.870
