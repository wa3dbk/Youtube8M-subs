00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you don't see a little point in the

you don't see a little point in the
middle<00:01:57.960> which<00:01:58.229> spoils<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.040> realism<00:01:59.549> often<00:02:00.299> as

middle which spoils the realism often as

middle which spoils the realism often as
you<00:02:01.079> wrap<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.219> petal<00:02:02.670> around<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you wrap that first petal around you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.590 
you wrap that first petal around you
want<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:05.070> stick<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> way

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
want to not stick it down all the way

want to not stick it down all the way
you<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.439> prepare<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.950> next<00:02:08.369> petal<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you want to prepare your next petal and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.410 
you want to prepare your next petal and
overlap<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.709> one<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.030> may<00:02:12.239> have

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
overlap it with this one so you may have

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.229 
overlap it with this one so you may have
one<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:13.080> two<00:02:13.379> petals<00:02:13.739> as<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.400> center<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.819> your

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
Rose but let's move on to the next layer

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.020 
Rose but let's move on to the next layer
take<00:02:18.810> three<00:02:19.260> equal<00:02:19.709> size<00:02:19.950> balls<00:02:19.980> make<00:02:20.849> them

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
take three equal size balls make them

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.750 
take three equal size balls make them
into<00:02:21.300> petals<00:02:21.690> again<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:22.800> overlap<00:02:23.520> them

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
into petals again and then overlap them

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.630 
into petals again and then overlap them
around<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.270> Rose<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:25.739> next<00:02:26.069> stage<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.580> be

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
around the Rose the next stage would be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.020 
around the Rose the next stage would be
to<00:02:27.060> add<00:02:27.420> another<00:02:27.750> three<00:02:28.500> petals<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.190> overlap

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
to add another three petals and overlap

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.720 
to add another three petals and overlap
them<00:02:30.239> around<00:02:30.569> your<00:02:31.160> center<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> your<00:02:32.459> rose

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
them around your center of your rose

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
them around your center of your rose
again<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:34.050> starting<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.560> look<00:02:34.769> more<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
again it's starting to look more and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.290 
again it's starting to look more and
more<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:36.480> rosebud<00:02:37.250> keep<00:02:38.250> adding<00:02:38.760> petals

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
more like a rosebud keep adding petals

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.130 
more like a rosebud keep adding petals
in<00:02:39.569> layers<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.709> three<00:02:41.430> one<00:02:42.420> layer<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.050> I'm

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
in layers of three one layer and I'm

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410 
in layers of three one layer and I'm
layer<00:02:43.440> three<00:02:43.920> another<00:02:44.190> layer<00:02:44.459> three<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.209> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
layer three another layer three and so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.589 
layer three another layer three and so
forth<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:46.080> your<00:02:46.860> rosebud<00:02:47.190> gets<00:02:47.970> bigger

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
forth as your rosebud gets bigger

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.000 
forth as your rosebud gets bigger
you've<00:02:48.810> got<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.110> make<00:02:49.260> bigger<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.709> bigger

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you've got to make bigger and bigger

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.619 
you've got to make bigger and bigger
petals<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.879> they'll<00:02:51.360> be<00:02:51.890> slightly<00:02:53.629> turned

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
petals and they'll be slightly turned

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.339 
petals and they'll be slightly turned
back<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.349> further<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:56.069> go<00:02:56.659> maybe<00:02:57.659> opps<00:02:58.080> of

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
back the further you go maybe opps of

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.800 
back the further you go maybe opps of
tree<00:02:58.680> layers<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> would<00:02:59.700> do<00:02:59.849> is<00:03:00.000> use<00:03:00.269> one

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
tree layers what I would do is use one

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
tree layers what I would do is use one
of<00:03:00.840> my<00:03:01.019> fingers<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.620> turn<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:03.030> bit

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
of my fingers and turn the little bit

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.440 
of my fingers and turn the little bit
that<00:03:03.720> little<00:03:04.110> Sun<00:03:04.470> bit<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.159> the<00:03:05.640> top<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.269> each

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
that little Sun bit at the top of each

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.380 
that little Sun bit at the top of each
of<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.530> layer<00:03:08.069> of<00:03:08.190> petals<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.849> three<00:03:09.000> petals

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
of that layer of petals and three petals

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.750 
of that layer of petals and three petals
around<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.959> turn<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.590> curl<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.519> back

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
around and just turn it curl it back

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.080 
around and just turn it curl it back
just<00:03:12.060> ever<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.930> slightly<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.459> next<00:03:14.879> row

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
just ever so slightly and the next row

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.830 
just ever so slightly and the next row
what<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.450> may<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.409> take<00:03:17.280> two<00:03:17.580> fingers<00:03:18.300> it's

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
what I may do is take two fingers it's

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.050 
what I may do is take two fingers it's
sort<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.290> like<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.530> pinching<00:03:20.159> formation<00:03:20.879> that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
sort of like a pinching formation that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.720 
sort of like a pinching formation that
my<00:03:21.180> fingers<00:03:21.629> are<00:03:21.659> in<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.409> v-shape<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.159> I'm

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
my fingers are in a v-shape and I'm

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.449 
my fingers are in a v-shape and I'm
going<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> use<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:25.049> turn<00:03:25.409> back<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.129> top

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
going to use that to turn back the top

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.000 
going to use that to turn back the top
of<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.239> next<00:03:27.599> layer<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.200> later<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.709> three

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
of the next layer this later the three

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.880 
of the next layer this later the three
petals<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.849> layer<00:03:30.120> back<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.349> ever<00:03:31.560> so

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
petals of this layer back just ever so

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.789 
petals of this layer back just ever so
slightly<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.540> little<00:03:33.870> v-shape<00:03:34.590> and

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
slightly in a just a little v-shape and

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.640 
slightly in a just a little v-shape and
that's<00:03:34.980> how<00:03:35.159> you<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:36.030> beautiful

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
that's how you get that beautiful

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.979 
that's how you get that beautiful
realistic<00:03:37.650> rose<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.400> curl<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.420> edges<00:03:39.540> back

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
realistic rose just curl the edges back

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.149 
realistic rose just curl the edges back
in<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.650> v-shape<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.730> ever<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.480> slightly

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
in a v-shape just ever so slightly

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.009 
in a v-shape just ever so slightly
certain<00:03:44.159> Rose<00:03:44.400> varieties<00:03:45.060> will<00:03:45.360> have<00:03:45.540> more<00:03:45.870> of

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
certain Rose varieties will have more of

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.470 
certain Rose varieties will have more of
a<00:03:46.110> curl<00:03:46.379> back<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.040> can<00:03:47.250> experiment<00:03:48.060> with

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
a curl back and you can experiment with

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.220 
a curl back and you can experiment with
the<00:03:48.690> ratio<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.140> them<00:03:49.560> large<00:03:50.340> petals<00:03:50.670> too<00:03:51.230> that

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
the ratio of them large petals too that

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.890 
the ratio of them large petals too that
are<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:53.099> curved<00:03:53.489> in<00:03:53.760> which<00:03:54.299> they<00:03:54.540> basically

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
are just curved in which they basically

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.899 
are just curved in which they basically
are<00:03:55.080> at<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.530> beginning<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:56.129> wanted<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.640> curve

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
are at the beginning to wanted a curve

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.520 
are at the beginning to wanted a curve
out<00:03:57.530> basically<00:03:58.530> what<00:03:59.159> I<00:03:59.220> do<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.909> after<00:04:00.569> you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
out basically what I do is after you

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.729 
out basically what I do is after you
know<00:04:01.680> several<00:04:02.549> layers<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.180> three<00:04:03.810> I'm<00:04:04.080> going

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
know several layers of three I'm going
