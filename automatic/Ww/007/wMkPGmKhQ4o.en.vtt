00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
see what we have surya phantom Orion and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.540 
see what we have surya phantom Orion and
beef<00:00:40.980> box<00:00:44.780> as<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:46.980> let's<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
beef box as we can see now let's take a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
beef box as we can see now let's take a
look<00:00:47.640> into<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> city<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.559> stadium<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
look into the city the stadium is the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.120 
look into the city the stadium is the
attack<00:00:50.670> type<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.230> reason<00:00:52.380> why<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> did

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
attack type now the reason why I did

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.119 
attack type now the reason why I did
this<00:00:53.280> cuz<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.809> metal<00:00:55.200> fury<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.739> much

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
this cuz if I do metal fury it's much

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.030 
this cuz if I do metal fury it's much
more<00:00:56.370> harder<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> camera<00:00:57.450> angle<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:58.040> all

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
more harder to get a camera angle at all

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.530 
more harder to get a camera angle at all
so<00:00:59.250> I'm<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> try<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.360> if<00:01:00.420> it's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
so I'm just want to try to see if it's

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.709 
so I'm just want to try to see if it's
gonna<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.469> better<00:01:02.300> because<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.539> mean

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
gonna be you know better because I mean

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
gonna be you know better because I mean
it's<00:01:03.899> better<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.259> attacked<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.800> cause<00:01:05.009> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it's better when attacked I cause it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.650 
it's better when attacked I cause it
made<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.550> other<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.940> they<00:01:06.390> keep<00:01:06.539> on

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
made for the other one they keep on

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.779 
made for the other one they keep on
getting<00:01:06.899> stuff<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.289> a<00:01:07.350> corner<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.490> that's<00:01:08.640> why

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
getting stuff in a corner so that's why

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.680 
getting stuff in a corner so that's why
I<00:01:08.820> picked<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.860> stadium<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.119> three<00:01:12.539> to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
I picked it the stadium so all three to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.920 
I picked it the stadium so all three to
five<00:01:12.899> rounds<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.590> narrow<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.869> be

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
five rounds so narrow one so now will be

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
five rounds so narrow one so now will be
later<00:01:21.960> something<00:01:22.560> year<00:01:22.710> round<00:01:22.830> let<00:01:23.760> me<00:01:23.939> more

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.760 

closer<00:01:50.429> even<00:01:51.429> more<00:01:52.289> closer<00:01:53.289> to<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> beat

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
closer even more closer to the beat

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.870 
closer even more closer to the beat
light<00:01:53.950> which<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.130> phantom<00:01:54.549> Orion<00:01:56.609> this<00:01:57.609> will

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
light which is phantom Orion this will

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.940 
light which is phantom Orion this will
take<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.119> while<00:01:58.240> why<00:01:58.929> am<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.259> saying<00:01:59.500> that<00:01:59.770> well

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
take a while why am I saying that well

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.859 
take a while why am I saying that well
because<00:02:00.189> it's<00:02:00.670> gonna<00:02:00.880> circle<00:02:01.359> around<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
because it's gonna circle around and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.839 
because it's gonna circle around and
eventually<00:02:02.109> and<00:02:02.770> I'm<00:02:02.950> guessing<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.579> next

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
eventually and I'm guessing in the next

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.990 
eventually and I'm guessing in the next
20<00:02:04.299> seconds<00:02:04.950> which<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.130> am<00:02:06.280> hopefully<00:02:06.849> I<00:02:06.880> will

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
20 seconds which I am hopefully I will

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.930 
20 seconds which I am hopefully I will
be<00:02:07.359> right<00:02:07.599> it's<00:02:07.899> going<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:09.569> attack<00:02:10.569> right<00:02:11.110> now

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
be right it's going to attack right now

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.949 
be right it's going to attack right now

much<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:20.120> anyways<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:23.139> think<00:03:24.139> I<00:03:24.230> see<00:03:24.469> the<00:03:24.590> spark

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
much so anyways I think I see the spark

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.860 
much so anyways I think I see the spark
effects<00:03:27.669> well<00:03:28.669> look<00:03:28.879> at<00:03:28.969> the<00:03:29.030> spark<00:03:29.389> color<00:03:29.629> is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
effects well look at the spark color is

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.759
