00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.290
 Today I'll show you how to take a photo and 360 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.849
 degrees 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 that photo you see on the site in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 Internet click the mouse rotates by a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.660
 side turn to the other you put 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 I could see an object from all sides 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.029
 I'll show you how to do it at the lowest cost. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.430
 possible and if all the material you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 need 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:36.719
 a camera with a base 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.660
 disk to take the pieces off a sheet of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.270
 see the large white one leaf see the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.780
 may be less for you to cut a disc 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.390
 slightly larger than the circumference of the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.329
 its basis that we did in a way that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 camera, it is important to have a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.399
 camera with the focus sent a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.160
 camera with auto focus 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.579
 Music does not work, there's no way to do it. 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.250
 because when it changes the focus or the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.439
 image moves a bit like you have a 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.600
 Bit of zoom when you're like her. 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.040
 adjusts focus automatically as 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 important that it be a camera 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 camera with a manual focus on a tripod in the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 photo camera two light tripods and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.659
 two posts again can be more 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.490
 that you have with you can 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.220
 also adapt with what you have in mind 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.710
 home some sport even garden 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.070
 Something like that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 a lamp and 1 but there is a room there as well 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.640
 illuminated with some of the sport in the same 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.060
 ambient light temperature 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.409
 the camera that I'm going to use here with 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.549
 a professional camera 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:02:02.540
 machine died and seven of a lens 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:04.469
 simple reel 18 and 135 on the same 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.569
 the computer 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:13.470
 I'm and it's running windows 7 of 64 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 bit is where I'm going to connect the camera 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.880
 and the USB cable control will control 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.140
 the camera to make all the doors by 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.640
 software that I will use is the software 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.960
 own camera than with the camera itself. 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.810
 from here in the west the team with this software 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.690
 I can go to set up the camera and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.770
 shoot everything here I'll create a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.930
 folder and will cease all photos already in the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.190
 certain place is that some settings 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.670
 software for example the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.070
 filename how many digits it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.790
 will number here two that I will take 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.310
 36 photos and the same number will start in 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.890
 photo number 1 ending at 36 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.740
 so it goes general the name you gave 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.490
 the number 1 number 36 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.420
 that number is important for later 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.340
 the software that does the 360 turn 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.260
 to be able to understand 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.420
 It's important not to have too much depth. 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.380
 focus so I'm going to use a 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.120
 lens opening 8 I'll put the iso 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.690
 that's so automatic but it looks like I 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.190
 turn on the light I'll put the yes 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.450
 which is a mistake that will not let 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.330
 grÃ¢ndola and will have a nice image 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.370
 Legal software that camera all 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.430
 photos are recorded in the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.750
 then in photoshop you can edit 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.860
 they all at once only this advantage 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.049
 ideal is to have an all white background 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.290
 believe that you just ask that you 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:59.340
 shooting does not need to appear or where 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.049
 she is and not her son's theme is only 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.489
 to have an idea to have a notion that 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:08.280
 She's really spinning in space. 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.810
 just as if it were floating right 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.670
 You will become a play and the bottom will not get you. 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.540
 bother when you spin on your 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.070
 using a sheet of paper to see the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.150
 on leaf to see the simple you 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.950
 stationery store 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.220
 I chose white white is a color 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.160
 It's nice that the tests I did were 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.550
 better because you had a brilliant with 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.130
 nothing of the piece projects a well shadow of 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.910
 take some parts when the parts are 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.160
 clear 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.530
 It's cool to wear one and see black but 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.520
 White usually looks good with everything here 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.370
 also 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.770
 if I'm using a disk to see the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.590
 also white who then looks to take 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.870
 Photo right position and right combination 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.380
 simulating an infinite background in this thing 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.490
 he does with this and with cba White 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.010
 base 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.460
 You will not realize it and it will seem like 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.600
 the largest is the only fund that it is our 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.920
 main 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:16.380
 You 'll need to take the photo efect. 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:19.050
 one screw right in the center of it in another 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.920
 Mdf disc glued on a coca base 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.580
 tex the right oven as well that you will 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.180
 to fit the disc that will be the base for 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.130
 put the products I made in this 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:39.480
 disk I did a numbering marking of 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.820
 360 degrees 10 degrees 10 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.070
 the power of the 36 points that people 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.260
 need to make a perfect video on the 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:54.810
 on object screw a dog here to 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:57.800
 be able to progress further with your 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.800
 should protect 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:16.660
 it's just you and one voice carrying the ball 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:35.050
 board computer 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:39.360
 It's just this goblet goes up to 106 photos that 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.360
 you need to give back tons 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.090
 it was good and finished well this book already 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.790
 makes it different right and was forgotten the 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.430
 my hair now I think he I 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.340
 tell and post it that the fields of 6 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.860
 and so the channel has enjoyed 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.820
 enough of the photography videos to 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.070
 best next video poor video 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.350
 who did not like the video showing how 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.680
 photos and how to use it. 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:22.800
 software that links these photos 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:26.130
 really willing to piece on creating in 360 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.520
 degrees how to post on the site path is nothing 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.520
 very complicated 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:37.220
 closing this project in the form of 16 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.220
 years
