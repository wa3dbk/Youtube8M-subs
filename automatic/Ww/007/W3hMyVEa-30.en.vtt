expert village in this clip we're going

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.530 
expert village in this clip we're going
to<00:00:06.930> be<00:00:07.350> installing<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.700> striker<00:00:09.000> plate<00:00:09.299> we've

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
to be installing the striker plate we've

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.610 
to be installing the striker plate we've
mortar<00:00:09.870> stood<00:00:10.080> out

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
mortar stood out

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.850 
mortar stood out
we've<00:00:11.809> pre-drilled<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> holes<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
we've pre-drilled the holes for the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860 
we've pre-drilled the holes for the
screws<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.610> don't<00:00:14.820> split<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> casing

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
screws so that we don't split the casing

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.109 
screws so that we don't split the casing
now<00:00:16.439> we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> put<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> screws<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
now we're going to put the screws in the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.490 
now we're going to put the screws in the
easiest<00:00:18.509> way<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.260> you're

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
easiest way to do it because you're

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
easiest way to do it because you're
dealing<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.980> three<00:00:20.250> inch<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:20.789> inch

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
dealing with three inch and one inch

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.519 
dealing with three inch and one inch
screws<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.320> inch<00:00:22.529> won't<00:00:23.100> hit<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:24.529> board

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
screws the one inch won't hit the board

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.939 
screws the one inch won't hit the board
in<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> back<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:27.050> you're<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.740> big

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
in the back so you're it's not a big

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.500 
in the back so you're it's not a big
deal<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.279> those<00:00:29.460> ones<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.179> screw

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
deal with those ones you can just screw

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.210 
deal with those ones you can just screw
those<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.080> regular<00:00:31.349> screwdriver<00:00:31.590> but

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
those in with a regular screwdriver but

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.320 
those in with a regular screwdriver but
you're<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.400> want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> use<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.210> drill<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.320> an

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
you're gonna want to use a drill or an

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.090 
you're gonna want to use a drill or an
electronic<00:00:36.330> or<00:00:36.720> powered<00:00:37.170> screwdriver<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
electronic or powered screwdriver in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.439 
electronic or powered screwdriver in
order<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.519> get<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.729> longer<00:00:39.059> ones<00:00:39.239> in

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
order to get the longer ones in

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.200 
order to get the longer ones in
otherwise<00:00:40.170> you'll<00:00:40.530> end<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.920> stripping<00:00:41.489> more

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
otherwise you'll end up stripping more

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.289 
otherwise you'll end up stripping more
likely<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.739> heads<00:00:43.979> of<00:00:44.129> these<00:00:47.299> again

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299 
likely than not the heads of these again

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.060 
likely than not the heads of these again
we're<00:00:48.449> gonna<00:00:48.540> put<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> large<00:00:49.170> screws<00:00:49.799> in<00:00:49.979> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
we're gonna put the large screws in the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.960 
we're gonna put the large screws in the
back<00:00:51.350> I'm<00:00:52.350> simply<00:00:52.739> gonna<00:00:52.860> start<00:00:53.339> each<00:00:53.549> one<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
back I'm simply gonna start each one of

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.240 
back I'm simply gonna start each one of
them<00:00:54.119> so<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.780> strike<00:00:55.440> plate<00:00:55.710> stays<00:00:56.040> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
them so that my strike plate stays in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:11.480 
them so that my strike plate stays in
place<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.620> in<00:01:10.740> nicely<00:01:11.220> when<00:01:11.370> you've

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
place and they go in nicely when you've

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:24.230 
place and they go in nicely when you've
pre-drilled<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> holes<00:01:22.820> now<00:01:23.820> you'll<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
pre-drilled the holes now you'll want to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
pre-drilled the holes now you'll want to
make<00:01:24.390> sure<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.050> put<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.440> screws

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
make sure that you don't put the screws

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
make sure that you don't put the screws
in<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.400> way<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.940> want<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.900> around<00:01:28.260> in
