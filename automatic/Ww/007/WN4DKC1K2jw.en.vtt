00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 have worked an injection pump 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.270
 as king I find the back of his neck 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 normally he will ask us for the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.130
 initialization of the pump is important 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.509
 that we know how to do that procedure 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.509
 let's go with the video 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.670
 i 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.699
 and let's go to the part here of we look 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.699
 toyota 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.880
 two 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.880
 diagnosis 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 general 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.740
 in this case because they are a hylux 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.010
 2010 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.370
 and here we are going to go train and favor 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 engine 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.840
 has been part of six adaptations in 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.979
 a utility and here there are several is between 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.210
 those the compensation of the injectors and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.130
 this option 4 the initialization of the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.310
 pump vehicles say it says this 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.900
 function is for learning the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.410
 bomb 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.410
 Y 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.520
 here are the possible problems when 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.890
 the engine have problems to start 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 after it has been replaced the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.620
 pump or the engine starts but still 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.280
 have problems then let's do 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.280
 the procedure 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 the conditions and the emission the vehicle 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 in contact ignition 1 and 20 and the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.160
 engine off then here the process 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.170
 we do not need special conditions and 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.170
 the initialization is complete 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.980
 many times this simple procedure 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.280
 it will solve many many 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.900
 erratic failure problems especially 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.340
 after having given service after 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.840
 have disconnected any of the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.390
 valves many times after having 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 washing a pressure motor then 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.810
 generate codes and gives this kind of 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.190
 problems but with such a procedure 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.620
 simple like this we could 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.569
 eventually solve it we eat with 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.230
 another procedure video
