00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.510 
though because if you do it'll explode
up<00:02:36.150> top<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.080> will<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.590> bad<00:02:38.430> news

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.670 

this<00:02:43.910> spot<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.300> general<00:02:44.750> keeping<00:02:45.230> people<00:02:45.590> off

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
this spot is general keeping people off

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.590 
this spot is general keeping people off
of<00:02:45.740> b-bomb<00:02:46.310> if<00:02:46.610> you're<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.210> side<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
of b-bomb if you're on this side of the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.300 
of b-bomb if you're on this side of the
map<00:02:47.750> maybe<00:02:48.170> looking<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.800> last<00:02:48.980> person

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
map maybe looking for the last person

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.860 
map maybe looking for the last person
alive<00:02:49.490> and<00:02:49.850> they<00:02:49.940> happen<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.240> be<00:02:50.300> planting

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
alive and they happen to be planting

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.710 
alive and they happen to be planting
this<00:02:51.560> spot<00:02:51.920> might<00:02:52.190> actually<00:02:52.400> work

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
this spot might actually work

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.710 
this spot might actually work
unless<00:02:54.440> they're<00:02:54.710> planting<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.400> because<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.390> is

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
unless they're planting a because a is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.470 
unless they're planting a because a is
is<00:02:57.590> not<00:02:58.580> right<00:02:58.880> for<00:02:59.210> this<00:02:59.690> spot<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:02.360> way

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
is not right for this spot so the way

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.760 
is not right for this spot so the way
you're<00:03:02.630> gonna<00:03:02.780> do<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.140> you're<00:03:03.290> gonna<00:03:03.350> look<00:03:03.590> at

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
you're gonna do is you're gonna look at

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.550 
you're gonna do is you're gonna look at
this<00:03:03.800> satellite<00:03:04.460> in<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.300> building<00:03:05.560> and

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
law and sorry that ii neither are the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.880 
law and sorry that ii neither are the
second<00:03:19.550> stand<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:19.940> hit<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.230> eat<00:03:21.680> at<00:03:21.800> the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
second stand in hit but you eat at the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.610 
second stand in hit but you eat at the
point<00:03:22.130> jump<00:03:23.060> up<00:03:23.240> and<00:03:23.510> it'll<00:03:23.990> hit<00:03:24.140> off<00:03:24.320> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
point jump up and it'll hit off and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.520 
point jump up and it'll hit off and
it'll<00:03:25.220> hit<00:03:25.370> your<00:03:25.490> person<00:03:25.850> planting<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:27.380> i

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
it'll hit your person planting and i

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.500 
it'll hit your person planting and i
think<00:03:27.830> it'll<00:03:27.980> still<00:03:28.340> hit<00:03:28.790> them<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.390> on

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
think it'll still hit them if it's on

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.470 
think it'll still hit them if it's on
the<00:03:29.630> other<00:03:29.690> side<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.920> bomb<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:32.090> there's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.300 

this<00:03:35.480> next<00:03:35.870> one<00:03:36.050> is<00:03:36.290> kind<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.950> hit<00:03:37.160> or<00:03:37.280> miss

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
this next one is kind of a hit or miss

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.000 
this next one is kind of a hit or miss
depending<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:38.210> how<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:38.960> throw<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.590> need<00:03:39.770> or

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
the sun's through the window because on

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.780 
the sun's through the window because on
the<00:03:42.470> other<00:03:42.590> side<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.070> one<00:03:43.160> no<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:43.550> are

goal is to get the name through these

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.510 
goal is to get the name through these
windows<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:54.050> to<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.320> other<00:03:54.530> side<00:03:54.800> and<00:03:55.400> if

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
you can see where my my alt accountants

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.120 
you can see where my my alt accountants
radar<00:03:59.930> always<00:04:00.110> on<00:04:00.260> there<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.710> that<00:04:00.860> top

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
radar always on there on that top

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.400 
radar always on there on that top
platform<00:04:01.460> so<00:04:02.450> where<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.690> can<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.110> look<00:04:03.260> at

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
platform so where you can like look at

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.450 
platform so where you can like look at
the<00:04:03.560> bomb<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.280> look<00:04:04.580> at<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.420> street<00:04:05.810> and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
the bomb and look at the street and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.200 
the bomb and look at the street and
watch<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.930> from<00:04:09.880> what's<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:11.030> called

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
watch the like from what's it called

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.660 
watch the like from what's it called
from<00:04:11.990> where<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.230> plaques<00:04:12.500> are<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:13.070> guess

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
from where the plaques are I guess

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.310 
from where the plaques are I guess

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
through those specific windows it's not

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.469 
through those specific windows it's not
specific<00:04:37.400> but<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.669> just<00:04:38.000> don't<00:04:38.150> want<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.360> to

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
specific but you just don't want it to

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.719 
specific but you just don't want it to
hit<00:04:38.599> that<00:04:38.750> bar<00:04:39.259> because<00:04:40.009> if<00:04:40.099> it<00:04:40.189> hits<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.490> bar
