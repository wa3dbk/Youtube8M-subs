00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.759
 eni's friends today we are at 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 talk about the galaxy s 4 and new 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.550
 top of the range smartphone from samsung 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.570
 successor of the galaxy s iii that last 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 year has been a great success 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 this year samsung proposes a new one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 model that keeps many of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.750
 features they have 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 marked the fat as3 begin 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.690
 from the design that is practically the same 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 same or better remember very closely 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.200
 that of other products in the series 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.450
 galaxy as galaxy note 8 in particular 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.620
 compared to the galaxy s3 is slightly more 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 thin has a slightly more profile 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.469
 edgy compared to the more defined net 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.859
 compared to the previous model 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.270
 on the back we have this feature 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:06.650
 dithering under the glossy layer e 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.510
 transparent of the back that really 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 especially though I actually have to say 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 then not so pleasant a matter of 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.689
 tastes and certainly but what is well 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.880
 noted of this smartphone is perhaps a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.360
 top of the line, in short, the quality of the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.790
 in our opinion, materials would be 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.549
 improved but it really matters though 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.210
 what is under the outer shell 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.500
 of the smartphone 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.990
 in this case we have in the screen 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.740
 even bigger than producing s3 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.110
 now we are about 5 inches a new display 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.570
 and technology full HD corruption 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.630
 then 1900 20 x 1080 pixels so very much 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.670
 very resolute changes processor and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.119
 within the edition that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.329
 available in our country we have a 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 qualcomm snapdragon 600 at 1.9 ghz a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.820
 quad core and practically the top ones 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.910
 range for the catalog 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.770
 of qualcomm 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.129
 we have the connectivity we have one 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.370
 well 13 megapixel camera that 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.660
 let's see with led flash 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.580
 then we obviously have a web camera 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.120
 front here in those in this case from 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.849
 a good 2 megapixels of sensors 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.670
 which is almost scary for completeness 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.319
 because beyond classic accelerometer 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.500
 moussa gyroscope etc. we have 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.989
 even the barometer the thermometer 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.640
 digital time and even a meter 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.260
 humidity 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.830
 samsung worked mainly on 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.330
 functionality and on the operating system 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.200
 seems obviously based on android 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.030
 jelly bean 4.2 in this case with the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.769
 classic touchwiz interface 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.080
 we have already learned to know about 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.269
 other samsung products but we have 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.159
 really an exaggerated amount of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.250
 features and applications e 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.870
 precisely, let us return for a moment 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.459
 lock screen and see one of the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.069
 Pearl features the new s4 classes 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.769
 we see the cursor also moving 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.239
 without touching the screen either by one 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.040
 calling feature and review that 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.720
 have already seen on the galaxy note 8 in 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.459
 that case the nib was used in this 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.620
 case instead with the finger even without touching 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.959
 the screen we can make some 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.670
 operation operations of the whole 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.930
 similar to what the galaxy has 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.239
 removed a presence to tell the truth 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.060
 perhaps not so indispensable on a 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.040
 device like this 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.409
 other functionality directly mutual 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.379
 from graxia 8 is that of multi window 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:44.219
 which we can practically take 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.530
 some of these applications drag 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.269
 this way and let's see just how 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.549
 we can open more 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.680
 simultaneously if we take the type 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.290
 gallery we put in the lower part 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.420
 of the screen and so we can see 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.639
 we have two applications in 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.349
 contemporary on the screen in this 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.939
 slider we can go to change the 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.769
 size is what we can do ad 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:14.579
 example is going to play a video 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.620
 then the lower part and in fact the sense 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.729
 really to navigate in this case the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.780
 our site as if nothing had happened 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.270
 then we try a long series of 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.900
 applications that start with the letter 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.800
 s 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.600
 on axis iii they have already learned 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.390
 get to know s boys the voice assistant 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.490
 siri here we also have to be translator 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.180
 which passively strips along strangle 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.870
 lens with the ability to translate 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.860
 we see not only a text of quoting it 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.690
 we can make it reproduce aloud 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.580
 the application allows both to type 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.670
 the text is from and through these 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.370
 buttons to insert it verbally and then 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.110
 when to translate a language that 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.610
 we can go to select from this 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.120
 minutes and then reproduce the result 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.980
 of translation into high volume 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.530
 precisely to dialogue perhaps with 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.380
 someone in a foreign country 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.570
 the optical reader is similar climb is 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.570
 practically consists of a sensuality 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.480
 god cr in real time from which it is enough 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.750
 frame a text with this whole 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.030
 precisely with the viewfinder on the word 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.400
 foreigner recognized and translated to 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.930
 other superimposed flight 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.680
 application made by samsung 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.230
 sr road which is practically a 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.840
 a staff drafts regarding 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.490
 sports activities 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.280
 here too we have different features 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.290
 actually the comfort level areas ad 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.510
 example uses the new sensors 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.650
 integrated into the device to tell us 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.720
 when the weather is good 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:57.010
 best to train we can go to 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.240
 configure the various types of training 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.060
 always to see how many calories and 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.130
 they burn configuring the type of 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.530
 activity so let 's see the point that 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.060
 they are already pre-set activities 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.970
 with i 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.310
 calorie consumption and then there was 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.590
 health board that this menu that 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.240
 it consists of allowing us to have a 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.070
 framework of protection activities 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.360
 the trend of our parameters like the 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.389
 weight 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.880
 then we have samsung hub that a new one 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.820
 application that practically would like 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.919
 be almost an alternative to play 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.960
 google store where we find music 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.430
 videos and books could once have been 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.210
 of the integrated separation hubs 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.910
 so the only application was a 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.560
 real digital store 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.450
 here we see example the section books not 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.430
 we have a catalog of books that 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.430
 we can go to download on our 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.020
 this device of the paganetto 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.790
 it's a real taste of the many 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.300
 applications available on the phone 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.520
 there is also samsung to download 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.690
 applications in production directly 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.430
 from the samsung store 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.220
 there is a play for example that allows you to 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.600
 play songs by synchronizing more 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:12.870
 galaxy s 4 together then for a listen 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.280
 shared class s4 is definitely one 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.430
 Extremely powerful smartphone here 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.729
 let's look at the graphical interface with good 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.740
 really smooth and fast open 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.979
 an application is practically immediate 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:30.900
 where I call the browser 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:34.890
 we go chrome like everything really is 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:37.940
 very smooth the line phone 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.650
 4g lte connectivity that it really is 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.229
 fast at least here in Milan we have 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.969
 could try it we have to open a 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.889
 article 

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:50.999
 if we have produced the loading is 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:52.679
 practically instantaneous with 3d games 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:55.579
 you have performance is really 

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.579
 remarkable 

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.259
 in short I must say that samsung if it cannot 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:07.529
 if you choose even a little more 

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:11.309
 carefully the materials for the 

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:13.649
 external display realization would have 

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:17.539
 certainly the best 

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:17.539
 android smartphone on the square
