what<00:05:48.600> I'm<00:05:48.720> saying<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:50.460> first<00:05:50.670> part<00:05:50.850> of<00:05:50.880> this

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
what I'm saying the first part of this

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.520 
what I'm saying the first part of this
game<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.450> actually<00:05:51.690> had<00:05:51.930> super<00:05:52.140> fast<00:05:52.320> mode

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
game I actually had super fast mode

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.170 
game I actually had super fast mode
because<00:05:52.680> it<00:05:53.100> happened<00:05:53.370> during<00:05:53.430> my<00:05:53.580> stream<00:05:53.880> and

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
because it happened during my stream and

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.270 
because it happened during my stream and
I<00:05:54.720> popped<00:05:55.050> a<00:05:55.200> popper<00:05:55.530> a<00:05:55.560> what<00:05:55.770> up<00:05:55.860> my<00:05:55.920> nose<00:05:56.100> I

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
I popped a popper a what up my nose I

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.880 
I popped a popper a what up my nose I
think<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.580> might<00:05:56.760> have<00:05:56.790> a<00:05:57.410> fuck<00:05:58.410> when<00:05:58.560> those<00:05:58.680> up

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
think I might have a fuck when those up

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.800 
think I might have a fuck when those up
