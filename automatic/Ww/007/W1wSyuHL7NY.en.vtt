dad guard but the first a is gone down a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
dad guard but the first a is gone down a
tone<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> G<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.050> D<00:00:19.230> GD<00:00:19.800> GA<00:00:20.789> D<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.359> then

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
tone to a G so it's D GD GA D and then

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.990 
tone to a G so it's D GD GA D and then
also<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.890> down<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> semitone<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.910> know

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
also it's down a semitone which I know

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
also it's down a semitone which I know
is<00:00:24.119> also<00:00:24.359> incredibly<00:00:24.720> annoying<00:00:25.010> yeah<00:00:26.010> there's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
is also incredibly annoying yeah there's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.070 
is also incredibly annoying yeah there's
also<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.400> tab<00:00:26.609> there's<00:00:27.090> tab<00:00:27.269> available<00:00:27.420> which<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
also a tab there's tab available which I

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.390 
also a tab there's tab available which I
think<00:00:28.349> there<00:00:28.500> should<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> link<00:00:28.980> somewhere

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
think there should be a link somewhere

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.870 
think there should be a link somewhere
below<00:00:30.060> my<00:00:30.300> feet<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:32.009> intro<00:00:32.399> which<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
below my feet so the intro which on the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
below my feet so the intro which on the
recording<00:00:33.239> runs<00:00:33.420> through<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> whole<00:00:34.350> song

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
recording runs through the whole song

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.830 
recording runs through the whole song
but<00:00:34.620> I'm<00:00:35.090> kind<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> play<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> live<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
but I'm kind of when I play it live it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.970 
but I'm kind of when I play it live it
is<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> intro<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:40.800> kind

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is it is just the intro is a little kind

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.910 
is it is just the intro is a little kind
of<00:00:41.010> tapping<00:00:41.280> phrase<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.969> hand<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.920> it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
of tapping phrase with this hand so it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.300 
of tapping phrase with this hand so it's
just

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
just

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.250 
just
you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so you're hammering on and pulling off

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.720 
so you're hammering on and pulling off
and<00:00:54.210> you're<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.950> from<00:00:55.950> the<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.520> kind<00:00:56.700> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and you're going from the it's kind of

fourth<00:01:00.510> fret<00:01:00.690> fret<00:01:01.470> best<00:01:01.829> thing<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
fourth fret fret best thing to do is to

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.920 
fourth fret fret best thing to do is to
kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> drill<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> until<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.629> becomes

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
kind of drill that until it becomes

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
kind of drill that until it becomes
almost<00:01:04.440> completely<00:01:04.920> natural<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> don't

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
almost completely natural you don't

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.710 
almost completely natural you don't
think<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.300> then<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.600> do

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
think about it and then you can do

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.900 
think about it and then you can do
things<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.229> hand<00:01:07.500> without<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.950> kind

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
things to the other hand without it kind

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:22.270 
things to the other hand without it kind
of<00:01:08.940> getting<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> way<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.410> this<00:01:10.590> it's

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.210 

so<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.820> baseline<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.689> bottom<00:01:25.220> bottom

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so the the baseline is the bottom bottom

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.480 
so the the baseline is the bottom bottom
straight<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.580> its<00:01:26.700> own<00:01:27.049> c-sharp<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.490> then

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
straight on its own c-sharp and then

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.660 
straight on its own c-sharp and then
these<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.540> hit<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> same<00:01:31.290> time

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
these two you can hit at the same time

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
these two you can hit at the same time
but<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.060> mute<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.600> bottom<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.049> with

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
but you have to mute the bottom one with

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.510 
but you have to mute the bottom one with
your<00:01:34.440> thumb<00:01:34.830> for<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.190> second<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.640> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.100 

so<00:01:39.520> I'm<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:39.970> tucking<00:01:40.210> my<00:01:40.509> thumb<00:01:40.720> around<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
so I'm just tucking my thumb around the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.620 
so I'm just tucking my thumb around the
top<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.560> kind<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.979> grabbing<00:01:42.220> it<00:01:42.400> there<00:01:42.630> which

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
top and kind of grabbing it there which

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.149 
top and kind of grabbing it there which
means<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.140> hit<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.530> fairly

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
means you can just hit it fairly

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.350 
means you can just hit it fairly
randomly<00:01:45.610> with<00:01:45.790> this<00:01:45.909> hand<00:01:46.119> because

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
randomly with this hand because

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.870 
randomly with this hand because
everything's<00:01:46.750> going<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:46.990> cover<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.259> up<00:01:47.320> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
everything's going to cover it up and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810 
everything's going to cover it up and
then<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.619> did<00:01:50.619> try<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.040> find<00:01:51.250> an<00:01:51.399> open<00:01:51.670> string

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
then I did try and find an open string

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.070 
then I did try and find an open string
for<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.090> but<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.299> couldn't<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.750> you<00:01:52.810> have<00:01:52.990> to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
for this but I couldn't so you have to

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.749 
for this but I couldn't so you have to
tap<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:53.920> better<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.340> do<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.670> an

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
tap that it's better to do it in an

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:03.500 
tap that it's better to do it in an
octave<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.180> well<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.630> got<00:01:55.869> both<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:56.140> those

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.240 

you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.029 

so<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.700> baseline<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so that's the baseline and the kind of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
one down here and then you've got a

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.320

really tight though because obviously

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.660 
really tight though because obviously
the<00:02:30.420> curbs<00:02:31.019> quite<00:02:31.200> tight<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:32.489> there's

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the curbs quite tight and then there's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.490

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the intro and that runs through the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.340 
the intro and that runs through the
whole<00:03:40.820> song<00:03:41.030> on<00:03:41.150> recording<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.810> very<00:03:42.200> glad

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.700 

so<00:03:59.630> it's<00:03:59.720> just<00:03:59.840> that<00:03:59.960> pattern<00:04:00.380> going<00:04:00.530> around

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
so second fret and then 9th to 11th so

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.380 
so second fret and then 9th to 11th so
far<00:04:06.890> if<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.130> sing<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.400> saucy<00:04:07.610> yeah<00:04:07.790> we're

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
far if you sing that saucy yeah we're

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.450 
far if you sing that saucy yeah we're
not<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.080> time<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:11.120> go<00:04:11.330> out<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.780> find<00:04:12.460> others

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
not the time to go out and find others

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.270 
not the time to go out and find others
who<00:04:14.240> aren't<00:04:14.510> just<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:17.120> ones<00:04:17.390> in<00:04:17.750> our

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
who aren't just like the ones in our

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.550 
who aren't just like the ones in our
cupboard<00:04:19.280> we<00:04:20.060> only<00:04:20.330> see<00:04:22.390> what<00:04:23.390> we<00:04:23.420> read<00:04:23.960> on<00:04:24.290> the

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
cupboard we only see what we read on the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.070 
cupboard we only see what we read on the
covers<00:04:25.070> we<00:04:25.850> only<00:04:26.120> bleed<00:04:28.000> we're<00:04:29.000> not<00:04:29.420> seen<00:04:29.810> by

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
covers we only bleed we're not seen by

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.379 
covers we only bleed we're not seen by
another

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.689 

so<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.319> cord<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:36.539> 9th<00:04:36.840> fret<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.550> that's

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
so that cord is the 9th fret and that's

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.059 
so that cord is the 9th fret and that's
for<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.289> beginning<00:04:40.289> of<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.409> bridge<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:40.770> guess

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:57.679 

I<00:04:45.770> see<00:04:46.770> my<00:04:47.069> mother<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:54.090> then<00:04:54.629> the<00:04:54.719> chorus<00:04:56.689> so

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
I see my mother and then the chorus so

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.629 
I see my mother and then the chorus so
it's<00:04:57.810> there<00:04:57.960> then<00:04:58.139> you<00:04:58.199> slide<00:04:58.530> those<00:04:59.430> two

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
it's there then you slide those two

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.999 
it's there then you slide those two
fingers<00:04:59.849> up<00:05:00.449> to<00:05:00.629> the<00:05:00.719> 4th<00:05:00.930> fret<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.409> then

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
fingers up to the 4th fret and then

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.369 
fingers up to the 4th fret and then
that's<00:05:02.219> on<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.610> 5th<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:03.930> chorus<00:05:04.229> just

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
that's on the 5th so the chorus just

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.459 
that's on the 5th so the chorus just
goes<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:05.370> follows<00:05:05.639> that<00:05:05.789> twice<00:05:06.000> again<00:05:06.469> stop

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
goes just follows that twice again stop

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.589 
goes just follows that twice again stop
looking<00:05:07.949> down<00:05:07.979> at<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.669> ground<00:05:09.620> stick<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.800> out

ground get out get it out get it up just
let<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:27.990> all<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:40.740> I'm<00:05:40.860> back<00:05:41.129> to<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.460> same

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
let it all and I'm back to the same

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:48.070 
let it all and I'm back to the same
chord<00:05:42.089> as<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.539> bridge

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.210 

so<00:05:48.860> it's<00:05:48.979> that<00:05:49.129> and<00:05:49.340> then<00:05:49.460> down<00:05:49.819> a<00:05:49.849> town

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.440 

and<00:05:54.220> then<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.490> goes<00:05:54.610> into<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:55.000> second<00:05:55.330> verse

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
and then it goes into the second verse

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.030 
and then it goes into the second verse
now<00:05:55.630> on<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.810> second<00:05:56.200> verse<00:05:56.380> I<00:05:56.740> basically

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
now on the second verse I basically

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.160 
now on the second verse I basically
found<00:05:57.280> a<00:05:57.400> way<00:05:57.490> of<00:05:57.580> mixing<00:05:58.020> percussion<00:05:59.020> and

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
found a way of mixing percussion and

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.129 
found a way of mixing percussion and
strumming<00:05:59.470> but<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:00.970> can<00:06:01.120> kind<00:06:01.330> of<00:06:02.310> catch<00:06:04.139> it

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
strumming but you can kind of catch it

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.200 
strumming but you can kind of catch it
can<00:06:05.290> kind<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.560> get<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.040> the<00:06:06.520> bass<00:06:06.730> note<00:06:07.000> and

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
can kind of get the the bass note and

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.140 
can kind of get the the bass note and
and<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:08.650> bass<00:06:08.830> drum<00:06:08.860> at<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.220> same<00:06:09.400> time<00:06:09.610> again

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
and a bass drum at the same time again

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:22.410 
and a bass drum at the same time again
so<00:06:11.050> if<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.200> go

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:31.350 

laughs<00:06:22.990> essentially<00:06:27.270> now<00:06:28.270> the<00:06:29.050> chorus<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:31.270> the

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
laughs essentially now the chorus so the

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.640 
laughs essentially now the chorus so the
first<00:06:31.630> half<00:06:31.810> of<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:31.990> chorus<00:06:32.260> obviously<00:06:32.560> it's

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
first half of the chorus obviously it's

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:55.850 
first half of the chorus obviously it's
all<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.830> same<00:06:32.980> chords<00:06:33.580> both

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.820 

and<00:06:56.670> then<00:06:56.790> on<00:06:57.180> the<00:06:57.480> O's<00:06:57.660> I<00:06:58.110> kind<00:06:58.380> of<00:06:58.410> open<00:06:58.770> up

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
and then on the O's I kind of open up

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.470 
and then on the O's I kind of open up
the<00:06:58.890> strings<00:06:59.220> a<00:06:59.280> bit<00:06:59.430> so<00:06:59.700> if<00:06:59.910> you<00:06:59.970> kind<00:07:00.090> of<00:07:00.210> open

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
the strings a bit so if you kind of open

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.150 
the strings a bit so if you kind of open
it<00:07:00.540> up<00:07:00.660> you<00:07:00.870> can<00:07:01.020> add<00:07:01.110> in<00:07:01.260> a<00:07:01.620> little<00:07:01.920> scratchy

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
it up you can add in a little scratchy

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.530 
it up you can add in a little scratchy
thing<00:07:02.490> so<00:07:02.700> there's<00:07:02.880> second<00:07:03.270> half<00:07:03.390> of<00:07:03.480> the

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
thing so there's second half of the

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:25.210 
thing so there's second half of the
choruses

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.890 

so<00:07:25.730> now<00:07:25.850> she's<00:07:26.090> scratching<00:07:26.540> that<00:07:26.660> and

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
so now she's scratching that and

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.840 
so now she's scratching that and
strumming<00:07:27.560> at<00:07:27.710> the<00:07:27.830> same<00:07:28.370> time<00:07:28.720> together

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:31.850 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.570 

so<00:07:32.390> that<00:07:32.570> takes<00:07:32.810> you<00:07:33.020> up<00:07:33.260> to<00:07:33.650> the<00:07:34.250> middle<00:07:34.430> eight

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
so that takes you up to the middle eight

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.250 
so that takes you up to the middle eight
which<00:07:34.730> is<00:07:34.760> the<00:07:34.910> same<00:07:35.090> as<00:07:35.600> the<00:07:35.900> intro

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:49.659 

and<00:07:38.350> so<00:07:39.160> that's

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:49.669 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.330 

and<00:07:50.210> then<00:07:50.719> the<00:07:50.840> last<00:07:50.990> chorus<00:07:51.319> is<00:07:51.560> very<00:07:51.889> similar

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:52.340 
and then the last chorus is very similar

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.249 
and then the last chorus is very similar
to<00:07:52.520> the<00:07:52.699> to<00:07:53.240> the<00:07:53.330> second<00:07:53.719> I<00:07:53.780> guess<00:07:53.930> we<00:07:54.080> just

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:54.259 
to the to the second I guess we just

00:07:54.259 --> 00:08:00.659 
to the to the second I guess we just
played<00:07:54.439> played<00:07:54.800> slightly<00:07:55.280> harder

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:00.669 

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:03.189 

so<00:08:01.669> you<00:08:01.759> kind<00:08:01.909> of<00:08:01.939> just<00:08:02.119> open<00:08:02.239> it<00:08:02.509> all<00:08:02.689> up<00:08:02.719> a<00:08:03.019> bit

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 
so you kind of just open it all up a bit

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.959 
so you kind of just open it all up a bit
more<00:08:03.349> so<00:08:03.649> that's<00:08:04.269> that's<00:08:05.269> pretty<00:08:05.539> much<00:08:05.629> it

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:06.969 
more so that's that's pretty much it

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:11.319 
more so that's that's pretty much it
stop<00:08:07.969> looking<00:08:08.479> down<00:08:08.509> at<00:08:09.049> the<00:08:09.199> ground<00:08:10.119> stick<00:08:11.119> it

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:11.329 
stop looking down at the ground stick it

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:16.959 
stop looking down at the ground stick it
out<00:08:13.239> someone's<00:08:14.239> gonna<00:08:14.449> put<00:08:14.719> you<00:08:14.929> down
