00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:10.260
 Even if you usually go casually 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:14.380
 There are many examples in which the brain plays a major role in the moon 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.580
 For example, our hearing 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:24.250
 Mike wide Masu equally all the sound that is there 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.250
 Point the microphone at the end and listen to the sound 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.279
 Like this, the vortex of sound 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:40.190
 Don't be swept away by a flood of this information 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.190
 Our hearing is are you able to not only accept information that has been very limited from the beginning 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:52.220
 First of all, physical selection by ear itself 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:59.380
 The frequency range you can hear is 100 hz to 20,000 hertz 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:03.240
 Our ears can not pick up the sound if it is lower or higher than this 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.240
 For example, it sounds low 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.549
 You can hear 100hz 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.549
 But if this is 20hz 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:26.570
 I do not hear in spite of being played at the same volume 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.570
 It sounds high again 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.310
 I can hear 10,000 hertz 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.310
 But if this is 20,000 hertz 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.330
 I can not hear this 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:53.270
 Music cds, records, etc. actually only cut the frequency band that can be heard with this finger 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 Furthermore our customers are 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.340
 Up only a select necessary information from within the frequency band that you can pick up in ear 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.900
 I have heard 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.330
 Casually pulling out of the crowd 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.730
 But the brain 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:16.130
 Unconsciously choose only the necessary sounds from this crowd 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.500
 Even in this kind of place of continuous shooting 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.290
 If you can hear me calling you 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:29.159
 You can notice 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.350
 This is because our brain has its own filter function that passes only the necessary information 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:36.130
 is 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.720
 We are not listening to the sound in the ear 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.720
 I'm listening in my brain 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:55.160
 Also, our qualifications don't just look at the scenery there 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.160
 Unconsciously, the brain is watching a video with various adaptations 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.570
 For example, Hiro 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:09.390
 The color of things will always seem the same, but in fact it is on the ship with the ever-changing light 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.560
 I'm continuing too much 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.760
 For example, if you take only this white color 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.819
 This color looks white in the sun light 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.840
 However 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.840
 When shooting under fluorescent light without adjusting the camera 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:35.159
 It looks so blue 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.159
 Also under the incandescent lamp 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.760
 It turned red this time 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:52.569
 This only has come out the difference in color even to shoot the same thing 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.830
 In the case of the camera to match the color of the bathroom of the light to adjust that white balance 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:00.590
 I want to be reflected in the above 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:05.920
 Our eyes are making adjustments automatically 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.920
 The eye coverage is also automated 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.930
 In the case of a camera, if you move the shooting target from a distance , Orcas will be blurred. 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:25.290
 But our eyes do this focus adjustment automatically and quickly 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.910
 Humans are not looking with eyes 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.910
 I'm looking at it in my brain 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:41.810
 Also please a good look at this figure 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:45.009
 As if it were a white triangle on a red triangle upside down with a blue shape and a wedge shape up and down 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.129
 We will see in a certain way 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.639
 This is called a tour triangle 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.639
 Optical illusion 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.120
 Matters that can not be seen in the first place in our eyes 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.669
 I have a blind spot 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.669
 No one has ever noticed this 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:14.120
 The optic nerve bundle extends from the back of the terrace to the brain 8 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:18.340
 Since there is no cell to feel light to the exit portion of the propulsion system 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.340
 In fact nothing is visible 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:30.950
 This is the blind spot 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:39.070
 The brain bears this blind spot from the surrounding situation and experience and the other qualification information 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:45.020
 In other words , it has a function to compensate for something that you can not see in the brain unconscious 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:48.950
 The operation function of this or Nizza's triangle also works 0 day 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.350
 Humans do not look at bodies with eyes 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:56.450
 Taking account of experience accumulation and guessing 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.450
 We have seen the tournament in the brain
