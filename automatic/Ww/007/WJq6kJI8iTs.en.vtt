00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
*Cue Red Vs Blue Intro*

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.740
Church: You can't just show up and start bossing people around, Tex. Bossing people around is my job.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.820
Church: I put in the time.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.460
Tex: I had to leave. I found Wyoming.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.160
Church: Yeah, Tucker told me. What happened?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.000
Tex: I thought I tracked him back to O'Malley,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.820
Tex: but by the time York and I got there--

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.580
Church: York? Your old Freelancer buddy?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.480
Church: Was Carolina with them?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.420
Tex: She was already dead.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.940
Caboose: But what about Bermuda?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.620
Church: That's not a state, dumbass.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.240
Caboose: Portland?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.080
Church: Shut up!

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.280
Tex: but he still had Delta.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.840
Church: Delta?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.640
Church: The A.I.?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.220
Church: How?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.280
Chruch: I thought They took them...

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.200
Church: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.740
Church: How is he still alive?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.460
Church: Aren't we hundreds of years into the future?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.120
Tex: I thought it was because of his armor.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.520
Tex: You know all the Freelancer suits had some kind of enhancement.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.720
Church: Right, like your invisibility.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.180
Caboose: And horrible meanness.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.420
Church: No, dude. that's all natural.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.820
Tex: York's was some kind of healing mechanism.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.900
Tex: It would help him recover from wonds in battle.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.300
Tex: I thought it might have kept him alive all these years.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.440
Tex: But after I found Wyoming, I knocked him out and downloaded logs from his helmet.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.020
Tex: There's something going on, Church, with a lot of people working against us.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.760
Church: Well, what did Wyoming say when he woke up?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.040
Tex: He didn't. Before I could interrogate him, he teleported away.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.420
Tex: One minute, he was there, and the next, he was gone.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.040
Caboose: What about the second after that?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.880
Tex: Can I kill him?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.520
Church: No, I'm saving him in case we need him for food.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880
Church: So Wyoming's armor let's him teleport?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.860
Tex: I don't think so.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.800
Tex: I think someone grabbed him from somewhere else.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.120
Church: How is that possible?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.220
Church: The only technology that I know that can do that is...

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.240
Church: Wait a minute...

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.800
Church: Each Freelancer had an enhanced suit of armor and an A.I., right?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.300
Tex: Right.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.020
Caboose: Right.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.820
Church: Your armor was Invisibilty and your A.I. was Omega.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.340
Tex: Right.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.040
Caboose: Wrong. Oops. Missed that one. Can we go back?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.540
Church: What was Wyoming's A.I.?

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.800
Tex: Gamma.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.380
Church: *Disappointed Groan*

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.860
Church: I gotta make a phone call.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.620
Gary: Hello.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.360
Chruch: Hello. This is Church, Gary. Or should I call you Gamma?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.020
Church: Have you been lying to us?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.900
Gamma: Lying is such a Shisno concept.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.020
Gamma: I mean, Human Concept.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.460
Church: You're a computer. I thought computers can't lie.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.860
Gamma: They can if they're programmed to lie.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.080
Church: Were you programmed to lie?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.560
Gamma: No.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.420
Church: God damn it!

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.160
Gamma: I have to go, Church.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.500
Church: Wait! What about the Aliens?! How do we--

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.360
Gamma: Goodbye.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.620
Wyoming: Hmmm. Do they know?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.960
Gamma: There is nothing to worry about.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960
Gamma: We are close to the end.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.160
Gamma: We will not be stopped now.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.820
Wyoming: We should get going. Hop in.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.540
Vic: Hello? Ring-a-ding. Blue Base, come in. Let's go. Hello. Come in.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.160
Church: Hello? Vic? Is that you?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.080
Vic: Hey, dude! How's it going? It's beens a while since we spoke.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.260
Church: Why are you calling me?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.660
Vic: Everything been going good? Yeah. that's great. Listen. Don't have much time to talk.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.860
Vic: Uh, been discussing some things here at Blue Command.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.880
Vic: We think everything is bad and now is the time to attack the Red Base.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.500
Vic: Turns out the Reds are up to no good and someone needs to kill them.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.360
Vic: A good way to do that is to send some people through the caves,yeah.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.740
Vic: Take them by surprise. Anyway, can't talk. Gotta go. See ya la vista.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.740
Church: Wait, ju-- Wait!

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.260
Church: Why do people keep hanging up on me?!

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.720
Sarge: Hmm, what's all this business?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.780
Simmons: Looks like a bunch of computer equipment, sir.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.520
Sarge: Excellent analysis, Simmons.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.040
Donut: And it's attached to some kind of TV thing.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.320
Sarge: So it is. Astute deduction, Donut.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.060
Grif: It shows all different parts of the canyon.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.520
Girf: Look. there's our base.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.920
Sarge: Ah, yes. Another incredible observation from the Stating The Obvious Department.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.440
Sarge: Thanks for nothing, numbnuts.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.700
Grif: *Sigh*

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.680
Sarge: Simmons, Donut, you two stay here.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.640
Sarge: Grif's gonna continue looking for Andy.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.240
Grif: Fine.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.640
Grif: *Sigh* I hate my job.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.060
Donut: Look! There's my room!

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.200
Donut: And the Locker Room!

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.280
Donut: And there's the Showers! Man! So many good memories!

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.400
Simmons: I hope this thing isn't connected to the internet.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.500
Sarge: The Blues must have set this up.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.960
Sarge: Crafty devils.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.520
Sarge: Spying on us all along.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.920
Sarge: What's all that?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.080
Simmons: That looks like Blue Base.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080
Sarge: Why would the Blues spy on themselves?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.060
Simmons: Maybe the Blues didn't set this up.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.040
Simmons: Someone else might have.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.900
Sarge: Well, maybe the Blues are so incredibly arrogant,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.420
Sarge: they just want to see themselves on TV.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.400
Sarge: Or I bet they have those stupid liberal equal time laws.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.920
Sarge: Commie Blue Bastards.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.480
Simmons: What if all this technology is just left over from an ancient civilization that was way more advanced than us?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.500
Donut: Wait a minute, how can an ANCIENT civilization be MORE advanced?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.100
Donut: If they were so advanced, where do they go?

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.020
Simmons: They could have mysteriously disappeared, only leaving behind a legacy of enigmatic technology.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.460
Donut: That's gay.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.900
Simmons: Oh, let's finish this fight later.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.860
Sarge: Look, what's that?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.760
Simmons: Looks like Sister's armor.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.980
Donut: Oh, no! What happened to her?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.600
Sarge: Clearly, She's been disintegrated.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.920
Simmons: Why would they do that?!

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.780
Simmons: We can't tell Grif. He'd be devastated.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.460
Grif: Tell me what?

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.220
Sarge: Tell you that your sister has been vaporized by the Blues.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.000
Grif: WHAT?!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.960
Simmons: Sarge!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.840
Sarge: Heh heh, It's just like ripping off a band-aid.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.340
Sarge: Quick and incredibly painful.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.200
Simmons: We just talked about this! We agreed not to tell him!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.780
Grif: What?!

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.160
Donut: You really need to start thinking about other people's feelings, Sarge.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.540
Sarge: Son, the only thing I need to do is stay red and die.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.300
Grif: What?!

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.820
Simmons: I'm really sorry, Grif. She's dead.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.560
Grif: How could this have happened?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.360
Grif: Aw, man. That was my little sister.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.420
Grif: I mean, I know we don't always see eye to eye, but I still loved her.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.320
Simmons: This has to be hard, Grif. I don't know what to say.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.580
Grif: I just...

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.540
Grif: I had no idea the last time I saw her would be the last time ever.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.880
Grif: I'd give anything to see her again and just to talk to her one last time.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.800
Grif: And I'm never gonna get that chance.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.780
Grif: It's the most empty feeling in the whole world.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.220
Donut: Oh, hey! She's not dead! She's just naked!

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.740
Grif: What?! That little slut! I'm gonna kill her!

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.420
Simmons: Take a Screenshot! Take a Screenshot!

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.440
Simmons: Greetings, fellow web surfer. Be sure to subscribe to our channel before you go.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.100
Simmons: It'll be just like we're freinds.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.740
Simmons: Not that I...need...friends.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.180
*Nervous Laughter*

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.740
Simmons: Please don't go.
