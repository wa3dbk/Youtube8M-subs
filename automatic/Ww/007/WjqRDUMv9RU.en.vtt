want to open it up and look inside and

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.710 
want to open it up and look inside and
take<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.770> look<00:00:30.070> at<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.369> deposits<00:00:31.119> that<00:00:31.300> form

okay<00:00:51.270> honestly<00:00:51.540> I'm<00:00:52.170> surprised<00:00:52.620> by<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
okay honestly I'm surprised by it

okay honestly I'm surprised by it
there's<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:54.060> really<00:00:54.330> much<00:00:55.260> sediment<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.220> this

there's not really much sediment in this
heater<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.060> 15<00:00:57.690> years<00:00:57.720> old<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.950> had<00:00:59.190> said

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
heater it's 15 years old as I had said

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.080 
heater it's 15 years old as I had said
previously<00:00:59.610> on<00:01:00.330> a<00:01:00.390> small<00:01:00.750> town<00:01:01.020> water<00:01:01.680> supply

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
the screen and obstructed the heater and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:11.380 
the screen and obstructed the heater and
caused<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.560> malfunction

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.680 

okay<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.570> here<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.230> have<00:04:13.380> your<00:04:13.650> typical<00:04:14.690> water

okay so here we have your typical water

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.910 
okay so here we have your typical water
filter<00:04:16.110> that<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.350> would<00:04:16.500> put<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.800> the

incoming water side of your tackle cedar

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.470 
incoming water side of your tackle cedar
which<00:04:19.590> would<00:04:19.739> be<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:19.980> cold<00:04:20.220> side<00:04:20.550> or<00:04:21.270> you

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
which would be the cold side or you

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.720 
which would be the cold side or you
would<00:04:21.690> want<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.080> filter<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.770> water<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:23.490> your

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
would want to filter the water in your

would want to filter the water in your
whole<00:04:23.880> home<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.920> you<00:04:26.280> change<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.730> about<00:04:26.940> once

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
whole home and you change it about once

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.990 
whole home and you change it about once
a<00:04:27.450> month<00:04:27.680> depending<00:04:28.680> on<00:04:28.920> how<00:04:29.100> dirty<00:04:29.340> your

a month depending on how dirty your
water<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.930> this<00:04:31.680> one<00:04:31.950> is<00:04:33.170> showing<00:04:34.170> what<00:04:34.620> it

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
water is this one is showing what it

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.020 
water is this one is showing what it
looks<00:04:35.220> like<00:04:35.460> as<00:04:35.760> you<00:04:36.300> can<00:04:36.480> see<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.620> same<00:04:38.100> color

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
looks like as you can see the same color

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.570 
looks like as you can see the same color
as<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.900> sediments<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.620> pulled<00:04:41.040> out<00:04:41.250> of

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
as the sediments that I pulled out of

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.080 
as the sediments that I pulled out of
that<00:04:41.940> tank<00:04:42.330> type<00:04:42.570> heater<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.550> this<00:04:44.550> would<00:04:44.760> be

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
that tank type heater and this would be

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.430 
that tank type heater and this would be
the<00:04:45.270> appearance<00:04:45.510> of<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.870> filter<00:04:46.200> when<00:04:46.320> it's

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
the appearance of the filter when it's

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.400 
the appearance of the filter when it's
new<00:04:46.650> when<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.340> inflate<00:04:47.850> this<00:04:48.390> character<00:04:49.200> with

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
new when you inflate this character with

new when you inflate this character with
the<00:04:49.560> water<00:04:49.800> when<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.250> first<00:04:50.520> turn<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
the water when you first turn it on the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.740 
the water when you first turn it on the
filter<00:04:52.110> swells<00:04:52.470> up<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.580> gets<00:04:53.760> thick<00:04:54.180> as<00:04:54.420> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
filter swells up and it gets thick as it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.100 
filter swells up and it gets thick as it
saturates<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:56.040> you<00:04:56.880> can<00:04:57.090> look<00:04:57.480> at<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.780> filter

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
saturates so you can look at the filter

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.070 
saturates so you can look at the filter
through<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.470> lexan<00:04:58.890> lens<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.660> then<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.870> just
