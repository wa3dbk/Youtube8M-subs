00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.610
 that's how he has me again 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.410
 Dunbar steepest 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 I stopped the recording first and then 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.980
 That's why a few seconds were missing on Bronze 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.019
 Issues are in the Klose and that is the main thing 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.589
 yes we catch a reception again 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.579
 what tricks he creates 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.319
 Reichelt already 1 Hamburg 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.319
 but immediately there are points ad 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.650
 Heidfeld was something nice 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.960
 These are really really relaxed moments when playing 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.800
 I already heard 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 this one is playing so far 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.910
 Lakic has already noticed again 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
 I hate that 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 and this time the catch went really snowing 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 the direction i believed this time i once gave 1 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.210
 That was the last time 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 Planning i have 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 rather, PokÃ©mon has trapped itself 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 This has already gone two times three times before I get my second program 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.170
 would have 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.050
 Aalen 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
 in the last second 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.870
 so could help with this now 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 USD 0 played work 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 Kickers Hubert percentage points 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.510
 the jersey number earlier 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 I am happy 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 April that was my contribution to the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.060
 Okubo and in Balocco provide exhibiting 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 and I hope we see ourselves in the next round agile 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.490
 then I am 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.540
 JOI 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.500
 and greetings al-turki Ochoa
