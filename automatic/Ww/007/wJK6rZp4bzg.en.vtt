is really supposed to represent a freeze
at<00:00:18.289> 100%<00:00:18.920> power<00:00:20.619> you<00:00:21.619> can<00:00:21.769> see<00:00:21.980> it's<00:00:22.099> a<00:00:22.369> little

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
at 100% power you can see it's a little

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.390 
at 100% power you can see it's a little
bit<00:00:22.730> it's<00:00:23.480> a<00:00:23.630> short<00:00:23.900> but<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.710> little<00:00:24.980> bit<00:00:25.070> stocky

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
bit it's a short but a little bit stocky

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.329 
bit it's a short but a little bit stocky
as<00:00:26.089> the<00:00:26.330> muscles<00:00:26.720> are<00:00:26.869> built<00:00:27.109> up<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:28.039> can<00:00:28.160> see

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
as the muscles are built up you can see

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.159 
as the muscles are built up you can see
the<00:00:28.490> veins<00:00:28.699> popping<00:00:29.119> out<00:00:29.329> his<00:00:29.539> chest<00:00:29.900> which

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
the veins popping out his chest which

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.050 
the veins popping out his chest which
look<00:00:31.009> more<00:00:31.039> like<00:00:31.429> nipples<00:00:32.210> crossed<00:00:32.509> out<00:00:32.750> and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
look more like nipples crossed out and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.600 
look more like nipples crossed out and
now<00:00:35.060> it<00:00:35.210> is<00:00:35.329> legs<00:00:35.899> as<00:00:36.230> arms<00:00:36.500> here<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:36.949> these

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
now it is legs as arms here and these

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.150 
now it is legs as arms here and these
eyes<00:00:37.820> are<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.120> little<00:00:38.149> little<00:00:38.840> cross-eyed<00:00:39.289> you

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
eyes are a little little cross-eyed you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.740 
eyes are a little little cross-eyed you
can<00:00:40.309> see<00:00:40.520> actually<00:00:40.910> underneath<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.449> eyes<00:00:41.570> I

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
can see actually underneath the eyes I

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.799 
can see actually underneath the eyes I
actually<00:00:41.870> tried<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.289> take<00:00:42.949> a<00:00:43.300> black<00:00:44.300> marker

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
actually tried to take a black marker

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.380 
actually tried to take a black marker
and<00:00:44.840> just<00:00:45.289> make<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.739> more<00:00:45.890> presentable<00:00:48.039> but

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
and just make it more presentable but

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.369 
and just make it more presentable but
not<00:00:50.390> sure<00:00:50.600> why<00:00:50.750> I<00:00:50.780> did<00:00:50.989> that

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
not sure why I did that

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.290 
not sure why I did that
I<00:00:51.410> guess<00:00:52.070> because<00:00:52.250> he<00:00:52.489> has<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.640> line<00:00:52.940> under<00:00:53.180> his

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
I guess because he has a line under his

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.580 
I guess because he has a line under his
face<00:00:53.539> but<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:55.010> could<00:00:55.519> see<00:00:56.079> some<00:00:57.079> of<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.260> dirt

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
face but I could see some of the dirt

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.669 
face but I could see some of the dirt
that's<00:00:58.420> accumulated<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.199> figure<00:01:00.530> over

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
that's accumulated on this figure over

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.310 
that's accumulated on this figure over
the<00:01:01.179> over<00:01:02.179> years<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:02.660> can<00:01:02.839> pretty<00:01:03.109> much<00:01:03.199> just

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the over years you can pretty much just

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.920 
the over years you can pretty much just
scrape<00:01:03.800> off<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.190> your<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:04.879> my<00:01:05.089> nail<00:01:05.360> which<00:01:05.750> is

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
scrape off of your with my nail which is

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.920 
scrape off of your with my nail which is
a<00:01:06.070> kinda<00:01:07.070> gross<00:01:07.310> but<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:10.160> was<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.300> think<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.720> got

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
a kinda gross but this was I think I got

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.650 
a kinda gross but this was I think I got
like<00:01:12.110> seven<00:01:12.830> figures<00:01:13.130> at<00:01:13.280> one<00:01:13.460> time<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:14.420> was

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
like seven figures at one time this was

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.360 
like seven figures at one time this was
one<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.050> first<00:01:15.290> ones<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.710> ever<00:01:15.830> gotten<00:01:16.100> it

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
one of the first ones I ever gotten it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.580 
one of the first ones I ever gotten it
it<00:01:16.550> just<00:01:16.700> kind<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:17.000> grew<00:01:17.150> from<00:01:17.180> there<00:01:17.590> was

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
it just kind of grew from there was

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.370 
it just kind of grew from there was
actually<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.360> rerelease<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.720> European

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
actually a rerelease of a European

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.730 
actually a rerelease of a European
figure<00:01:21.970> which<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.240> lot<00:01:23.960> taller<00:01:24.230> than<00:01:24.620> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
figure which is a lot taller than the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010 
figure which is a lot taller than the
other<00:01:24.770> one<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:25.190> it's<00:01:25.630> still<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.780> same<00:01:26.990> idea

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
other one but it's still the same idea

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.000 
other one but it's still the same idea
as<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:28.130> veins<00:01:28.520> pop<00:01:29.230> popping<00:01:30.230> out<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.380> his<00:01:30.650> arms

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
as the veins pop popping out of his arms

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.770

and<00:01:31.160> legs<00:01:31.370> doesn't<00:01:32.060> have<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.360> nipple<00:01:32.660> ones

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
and legs doesn't have the nipple ones

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.700 
and legs doesn't have the nipple ones

on<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.140> same<00:04:27.380> mold

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
on the same mold

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.570 
on the same mold
they<00:04:28.460> just<00:04:28.700> done<00:04:28.970> in

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
these and does improve the look at a

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:02.689 
these and does improve the look at a
figure<00:05:02.129> a<00:05:02.280> lot

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
figure a lot

figure a lot
I<00:05:02.729> just<00:05:03.449> never<00:05:04.020> been<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:05.520> know<00:05:06.530> confident

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
I just never been you know confident

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.379 
I just never been you know confident
enough<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:08.039> my<00:05:08.190> own<00:05:08.219> skills<00:05:08.789> to<00:05:08.940> be<00:05:09.060> able<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> do

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
enough of my own skills to be able to do

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.629 
enough of my own skills to be able to do
that<00:05:09.539> but<00:05:10.139> it's<00:05:10.319> only<00:05:10.500> on<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.710> front<00:05:10.949> not<00:05:11.430> on

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
that but it's only on the front not on

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.969 
that but it's only on the front not on
the<00:05:11.729> back<00:05:11.909> which<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.509> pretty<00:05:12.810> lazy<00:05:13.879> but<00:05:14.879> still

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
the back which is pretty lazy but still

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.399 
the back which is pretty lazy but still
it's<00:05:16.979> probably<00:05:17.370> my<00:05:17.580> favorite<00:05:18.479> Frieza<00:05:18.960> figure

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
it's probably my favorite Frieza figure

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
because I just I just preferred a non
