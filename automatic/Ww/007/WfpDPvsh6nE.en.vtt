00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 spox a cartridge league of legends me 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.190
 stand by a champion update 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.160
 for flora and as always 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.130
 we start with the passion and that means 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.570
 just dance and before what so that for 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.920
 has always healed if you have someone 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.670
 Over time this effect has attacked 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.500
 was stackable 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.020
 now she has a new passive namely 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.850
 the dance and thus rival as always 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.740
 the enemy after a few seconds 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 another spot when we attack this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 cause your bonus to get hurt 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.310
 a misston speed bach and get 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.920
 even half of this pasture 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 then refresh the spot again 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 means we can again afterwards 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.120
 to search again 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 and then hit it again that's us 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.989
 always live through it when 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.879
 but now you are going to skin 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.379
 Of course, do not solve them 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170
 as you must him this area 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.390
 meet this spot here 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.610
 So come to the second namely highway 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.199
 has been twice in one 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.719
 certain direction and was so mobile 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.520
 so now we can lay a box 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.649
 and you realize we have one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.930
 maximum range but this 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 reach further triggers that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.840
 If we are here now in this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 radius meet someone 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.700
 Do you see flora attacks automatically 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 the nearest champion if you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 Minions does not need you either 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 we are worried 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 you always prioritize her 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 champions and we can do that too 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.490
 triggering more spots that means we 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.830
 can also use this to the election spots 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.950
 I showed her now again is already 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.570
 just go here and you see 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.400
 already the spot is triggered and can 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 thus, of course, then triggered 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 become 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.540
 good came the second game is always 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 still the post but we do not get 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.009
 more as it was currently the case 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.930
 bonus attack so passively but 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.060
 we can only parry 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.670
 Now you would think for the first time 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 of course a bit shit though 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 Poststelle has become a bit 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.729
 he has now changed the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 possibility of any harm and every one is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.399
 leave for the next 075 seconds 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.649
 completely disable and in the opponent in 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.299
 to beat the direction of the opponent with 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.070
 Just show it to the spot 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.270
 here 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.899
 there you see display always makes 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.300
 still hurt 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.580
 and has another another 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.660
 nice effect namely he invites the opponents 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.300
 and wendy s 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.070
 should be in these 075 seconds 1 then 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.440
 a table to block something else 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.370
 then the spell did not kill for 15 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440
 seconds sun stood for 15 seconds 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.180
 but it is 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.330
 that is, if we can do it with it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.860
 should tell someone and you do 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.530
 his way on you and you have yours 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 post then you can do it yourself 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.890
 and that's pretty nice option 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.050
 I find a lot of characters a bit 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.160
 develop cracker play to develop I find 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.390
 every case very nice times look like it 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.060
 then on the liveserver becomes unique 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.490
 manko is just you lose your bonus 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.230
 effects with which you had come before 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.180
 for the third game namely blade work at 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.370
 Blake is so it was before we did 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.100
 get text for a short time and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.630
 have also got a music now 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.580
 it so we get for two attacks 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.770
 bonus attack speed being the first 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.690
 can not attack kitten but one 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.790
 Slow acts on the opponent and the second 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.170
 attack a guaranteed would be critical 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.170
 then show once we activate 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.940
 the day you therefore see the second has is 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.970
 automatically in kripp what course 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.530
 just for such items as infiniti 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.190
 or generally items with high ethics 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.810
 damage pretty cool and the player 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.680
 got me so high col and think so 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.350
 I'll just get him 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.270
 probably first grow up 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.030
 because the wsp as I said no more ad 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.920
 and the cube is not necessarily synonymous 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.270
 good for that one is good at 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.190
 last game namely grand challenge 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.060
 before we gave an ultimate 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.980
 with which we go from opponent to opponent 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.560
 could pretty and on a very very 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.820
 Do a lot of harm to customers now 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.610
 we in the eu with whom we only one 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.370
 champion can attack yes or how 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.770
 they can do theirs and then we revise 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.790
 all four more spots from the opponent for 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.730
 every change offered to grab iran 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.110
 the opponent gets 19 percent 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.239
 from his maximum life as a luder 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.160
 image and at the same time we still get 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.470
 while we are near the shiny one 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.080
 agl are just fun speed if we are all 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.709
 four more spots or if the target 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.989
 dies then a field comes up 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.100
 the ground that all airlines and us 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.560
 even for 80 plus 32 live every second 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.549
 for 50 and that's very much me 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.500
 will show you once 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.340
 I'll give the idea that we have now 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 every two spots 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.520
 zack zack zack and this falls you 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.180
 So, not only does each of us heal ourselves 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.340
 but also our allies at 80 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.919
 plus 230 so that even scales with hd 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.870
 and not just a little bit and I have to 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.490
 say it makes for a super cute 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.930
 possibility to get a little bit more 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.350
 reinzubringen utility in teams with 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.040
 and is therefore also great 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.260
 strong on the way 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.970
 I would say that was it for today 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.930
 the champion spotlight or with the 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.120
 champion update you can you ever 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.350
 what you write about the champion 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.300
 update old and I have to say I think so 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.919
 It's a cool reminder completely different 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.930
 many on the liveservern I find that 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.490
 uni was changed the crew of wsp 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.630
 works differently the esp is too 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.100
 completely changed and of course the 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.450
 passive I think a great idea 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.760
 I love it 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.910
 and then I would say you know if 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.910
 his
