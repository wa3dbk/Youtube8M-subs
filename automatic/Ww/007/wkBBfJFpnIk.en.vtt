get<00:00:38.320> some<00:00:38.530> besides<00:00:39.010> our<00:00:39.190> own<00:00:39.219> teammates<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.539> I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
get some besides our own teammates and I

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.139 
get some besides our own teammates and I
think<00:00:40.899> we<00:00:41.230> performed<00:00:41.710> pretty<00:00:41.859> well<00:00:41.980> today<00:00:42.969> is

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
think we performed pretty well today is

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.329 
think we performed pretty well today is
our<00:00:43.239> first<00:00:43.300> game<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:44.409> had<00:00:44.530> some<00:00:44.710> things<00:00:44.949> that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
our first game we had some things that

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.390 
our first game we had some things that
went<00:00:45.940> wrong<00:00:45.999> we<00:00:46.510> fix<00:00:46.749> the<00:00:46.899> cops<00:00:47.109> on<00:00:47.289> you

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
went wrong we fix the cops on you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.540 
went wrong we fix the cops on you
so<00:00:50.400> I<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:51.060> first<00:00:51.300> single<00:00:51.600> well<00:00:52.550> just
