here goes

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:20.550 
here goes
here<00:01:13.690> we're<00:01:13.870> to<00:01:14.020> add<00:01:14.730> 23<00:01:15.730> plus<00:01:17.130> 34<00:01:18.780> well<00:01:19.780> let's

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
here we're to add 23 plus 34 well let's

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.020 
here we're to add 23 plus 34 well let's
begin<00:01:20.770> by<00:01:21.010> writing<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:22.420> 23<00:01:23.350> on<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:24.130> top<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:27.030> 34

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
begin by writing the 23 on the top of 34

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.110 
begin by writing the 23 on the top of 34
and<00:01:28.330> lining<00:01:28.750> up<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.650> 3<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> 4<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:30.970> the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
and lining up the 3 and the 4 in the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.100 
and lining up the 3 and the 4 in the
ones<00:01:31.600> place<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:33.190> 2<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.670> 3<00:01:33.900> twos<00:01:34.900> and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
ones place and the 2 and the 3 twos and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.710 
ones place and the 2 and the 3 twos and
the<00:01:35.170> threes<00:01:35.230> in<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.980> tens<00:01:36.850> place<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.540> then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
the threes in the tens place and then

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.070 
the threes in the tens place and then
we'll<00:01:37.810> underline<00:01:38.260> that<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.890> now<00:01:39.900> we're<00:01:40.900> going

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
we'll underline that and now we're going

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.200 
we'll underline that and now we're going
to<00:01:41.170> add<00:01:41.350> 3<00:01:41.890> plus<00:01:42.400> 4<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.210> that's<00:01:43.600> 7<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:46.090> we

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
to add 3 plus 4 and that's 7 and then we

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.880 
to add 3 plus 4 and that's 7 and then we
have<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.540> add<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.320> 2<00:01:47.620> in<00:01:47.980> 23<00:01:48.640> which<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:48.880> really

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
have to add the 2 in 23 which is really

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.300 
have to add the 2 in 23 which is really
22<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.040> 3<00:01:51.460> which<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.420> really<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.500> 3<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:53.830> 34

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
22 the 3 which is really the 3 and 34

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.120 
22 the 3 which is really the 3 and 34
which<00:01:54.490> is<00:01:54.610> really<00:01:54.790> 30<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:55.360> 20<00:01:55.960> plus<00:01:56.110> 30<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.620> 50

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
which is really 30 and 20 plus 30 is 50

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.110 
which is really 30 and 20 plus 30 is 50
when<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:58.180> write<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.540> 5<00:01:58.840> here<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.710> is

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
when we write the 5 here that really is

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.890 
when we write the 5 here that really is
indicating<00:02:01.120> 50<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.290> we<00:02:02.410> end<00:02:02.560> up<00:02:02.620> with<00:02:02.730> 57<00:02:03.900> for

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
indicating 50 so we end up with 57 for

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.359 
indicating 50 so we end up with 57 for
our<00:02:05.170> final<00:02:05.770> answer<00:02:05.980> here<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.510> 23<00:02:08.170> plus<00:02:08.380> 34

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
our final answer here so 23 plus 34

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.050 
our final answer here so 23 plus 34
equals<00:02:10.620> 57

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.759 

so<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.120> probably<00:02:16.450> noticed<00:02:16.810> me<00:02:16.930> right<00:02:17.590> then

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
so you probably noticed me right then

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.240 
so you probably noticed me right then
just<00:02:17.980> tap<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.189> stop<00:02:18.430> button<00:02:19.379> well<00:02:20.379> great<00:02:20.650> okay

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
just tap the stop button well great okay

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.979 
just tap the stop button well great okay
so<00:02:21.310> we're<00:02:21.549> two<00:02:21.730> minutes<00:02:22.060> into<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.930> now

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
so we're two minutes into this and now

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.940 
so we're two minutes into this and now
what<00:02:23.379> we're<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.829> do<00:02:24.099> is<00:02:24.420> dock<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
what we're going to do is dock the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.130 
what we're going to do is dock the
smartpen<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:28.060> sync<00:02:28.329> with<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.599> Livescribe

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
smartpen to sync with the Livescribe
