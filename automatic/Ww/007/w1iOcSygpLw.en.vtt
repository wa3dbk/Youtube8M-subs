those<00:03:45.720> spots<00:03:46.139> where<00:03:46.439> you<00:03:46.560> want<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.400> music<00:03:47.549> to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
those spots where you want the music to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.689 
those spots where you want the music to
do<00:03:48.329> something<00:03:48.599> specific<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:50.220> instance<00:03:50.310> if

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
do something specific so for instance if

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.589 
do something specific so for instance if
someone<00:03:52.159> high<00:03:53.159> fives<00:03:53.430> someone<00:03:53.879> in<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.359> film

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
someone high fives someone in the film

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.539 
someone high fives someone in the film
then<00:03:55.109> that<00:03:55.259> might<00:03:55.409> be<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> good<00:03:55.829> point<00:03:56.189> to<00:03:56.280> pick

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
then that might be a good point to pick

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.099 
then that might be a good point to pick
up<00:03:56.699> on<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.970> with<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.449> music<00:03:57.659> where<00:03:57.989> their

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
up on that with the music where their

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.749 
up on that with the music where their
music<00:03:58.349> suddenly<00:03:58.500> Rises<00:03:59.009> or<00:03:59.129> suddenly

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759 
music suddenly Rises or suddenly

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.729 
music suddenly Rises or suddenly
resolved<00:04:00.239> or<00:04:00.569> something<00:04:00.870> like<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.019> sewing

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
resolved or something like that sewing

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.409 
resolved or something like that sewing
musically<00:04:02.159> which<00:04:02.310> reflects<00:04:02.669> that<00:04:02.759> now<00:04:03.269> again

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
musically which reflects that now again

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.149 
musically which reflects that now again
this<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.750> where<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.019> all<00:04:04.169> about<00:04:04.470> your

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
this is where it's all about your

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.830 
this is where it's all about your
judgment<00:04:05.669> of<00:04:05.759> whether<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.269> want<00:04:06.479> something

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
judgment of whether you want something

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.259 
judgment of whether you want something
to<00:04:06.870> fit<00:04:07.489> exactly<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:09.359> for<00:04:09.659> instance<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:11.269> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
to fit exactly like for instance a the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.689 
to fit exactly like for instance a the
Mickey<00:04:12.629> Mouse<00:04:12.720> cartoons<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.489> see

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
Mickey Mouse cartoons that you can see

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.870 
Mickey Mouse cartoons that you can see
how<00:04:14.909> as<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.209> car<00:04:15.840> teen<00:04:16.019> plays<00:04:16.259> out<00:04:16.880> everything

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
how as the car teen plays out everything

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.580 
how as the car teen plays out everything
that<00:04:18.150> happens<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.570> characters<00:04:18.750> is

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
that happens to the characters is

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.990 
that happens to the characters is
reflected<00:04:20.099> in<00:04:20.159> the<00:04:20.220> music<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.699> character

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
reflected in the music if the character

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.879 
reflected in the music if the character
stops<00:04:21.299> then<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.630> musical<00:04:22.019> stop<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.380> it's

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
stops then the musical stop and it's

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.360 
stops then the musical stop and it's
very<00:04:23.150> literary<00:04:24.529> way<00:04:25.529> of<00:04:25.710> doing

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
very literary way of doing

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.430 
very literary way of doing
things<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:27.060> then<00:04:27.180> sometimes<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.840> will<00:04:27.990> be<00:04:28.199> a

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
things but then sometimes it will be a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.260 
things but then sometimes it will be a
lot<00:04:28.860> more<00:04:28.889> subtle<00:04:29.520> sometimes<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.030> make<00:04:30.150> no

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
lot more subtle sometimes I make no

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480 
lot more subtle sometimes I make no
music<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:31.169> is<00:04:31.350> another<00:04:31.800> thing<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.130> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
music and this is another thing that the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.560 
music and this is another thing that the
film<00:04:32.699> composer<00:04:33.030> asked<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.300> really<00:04:33.449> think

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
film composer asked to really think

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.620 
film composer asked to really think
about<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.990> well<00:04:34.820> what<00:04:35.820> kind<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.090> calls<00:04:36.300> we<00:04:36.419> want

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
about is well what kind of calls we want

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.420 
about is well what kind of calls we want
to<00:04:36.690> make<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.990> terms<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:38.100> he<00:04:38.220> showed<00:04:38.400> me

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
to make in terms of that so he showed me

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.830 
to make in terms of that so he showed me
an<00:04:38.580> advert<00:04:38.970> they've<00:04:39.150> been<00:04:39.300> working<00:04:39.419> on<00:04:39.690> and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
an advert they've been working on and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.590 
an advert they've been working on and
seeing<00:04:40.800> how<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.699> points<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.060> picked<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:42.419> on

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
seeing how the points you picked up on

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.890 
seeing how the points you picked up on
to<00:04:43.169> be<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:44.250> know<00:04:44.370> things<00:04:44.729> that<00:04:44.940> are<00:04:45.300> notable

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
to be you know things that are notable

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.870 
to be you know things that are notable
in<00:04:46.050> terms<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.500> music<00:04:46.800> whether<00:04:47.610> there's

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
in terms of the music whether there's

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.060 
in terms of the music whether there's
going<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.060> be<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.169> know<00:04:49.290> a<00:04:49.320> decline<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:49.830> the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
going to be a you know a decline in the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.030 
going to be a you know a decline in the
music<00:04:50.430> where<00:04:50.970> this<00:04:51.060> where<00:04:51.479> there's<00:04:51.600> nothing

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
music where this where there's nothing

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.200 
music where this where there's nothing
or<00:04:53.040> whether<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.550> going<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.880> be<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> real

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
or whether this is going to be a real

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.000 
or whether this is going to be a real
high<00:04:54.389> point<00:04:54.419> of<00:04:54.780> climax<00:04:54.960> anything<00:04:55.830> like<00:04:55.979> that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
high point of climax anything like that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.830 
high point of climax anything like that
it<00:04:56.729> was<00:04:56.880> really<00:04:57.060> cool<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.270> be<00:04:57.389> able<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.630> see

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
it was really cool to be able to see

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.370 
it was really cool to be able to see
exactly<00:04:58.520> which<00:04:59.520> parts<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.150> this<00:05:01.110> made<00:05:01.289> me

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
exactly which parts and this made me

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.900 
exactly which parts and this made me
think<00:05:01.410> well<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:02.280> know<00:05:02.310> I<00:05:02.400> should<00:05:02.699> be<00:05:02.789> doing

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
think well you know I should be doing

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.550 
think well you know I should be doing
this<00:05:03.030> more<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.870> if<00:05:04.050> there's<00:05:04.289> something<00:05:04.470> that

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
this more so if there's something that

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.040 
this more so if there's something that
you're<00:05:04.770> interested<00:05:04.830> in<00:05:05.600> if<00:05:06.600> this<00:05:06.900> is

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
you're interested in if this is

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.710 
you're interested in if this is
something<00:05:07.199> interested<00:05:07.650> in<00:05:07.789> film<00:05:08.789> music<00:05:09.479> um

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
something interested in film music um

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.779 
something interested in film music um
then<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.889> think<00:05:11.100> it'd<00:05:11.190> be<00:05:11.220> really<00:05:11.310> worthwhile

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
then I think it'd be really worthwhile

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.830 
then I think it'd be really worthwhile
to<00:05:12.240> just<00:05:12.479> watched<00:05:13.410> films<00:05:13.889> or<00:05:14.449> maybe<00:05:15.449> a<00:05:15.539> clip<00:05:15.810> of

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
to just watched films or maybe a clip of

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.740 
to just watched films or maybe a clip of
a<00:05:15.990> film<00:05:16.199> would<00:05:16.260> be<00:05:16.320> better<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:17.340> just<00:05:17.370> see<00:05:17.820> what

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
a film would be better to just see what

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.570 
a film would be better to just see what
does<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.080> music<00:05:19.169> d<00:05:19.470> really<00:05:19.800> listen<00:05:20.160> hard<00:05:20.340> for

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
does the music d really listen hard for

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.740 
does the music d really listen hard for
the<00:05:20.639> music<00:05:20.970> to<00:05:21.120> see<00:05:21.380> well<00:05:22.380> does<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.160> music<00:05:23.750> you

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
the music to see well does the music you

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.960 
the music to see well does the music you
know<00:05:24.870> it<00:05:25.590> there's<00:05:25.860> not<00:05:25.949> going<00:05:26.070> to<00:05:26.160> be<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.310> big

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
know it there's not going to be a big

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.820 
know it there's not going to be a big
cymbal<00:05:27.419> crash<00:05:27.630> every<00:05:28.080> single<00:05:28.380> time<00:05:28.500> something

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
cymbal crash every single time something

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.710 
cymbal crash every single time something
happens<00:05:29.130> but<00:05:29.789> listen<00:05:29.970> out<00:05:30.240> for<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.450> times

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
happens but listen out for the times

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.290 
happens but listen out for the times
when<00:05:30.870> there<00:05:31.620> are<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:32.430> know<00:05:32.520> rises<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.120> falls

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
when there are you know rises and falls

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.629 
when there are you know rises and falls
in<00:05:33.599> terms<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.139> music<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.620> whether<00:05:35.550> that

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
in terms of the music and whether that

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.219 
in terms of the music and whether that
reflects<00:05:36.330> what's<00:05:36.510> going<00:05:36.720> on<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.990> film

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
reflects what's going on in the film

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.779 
reflects what's going on in the film
whether<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.919> goes<00:05:38.010> to<00:05:38.160> cover<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.430> opposite

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
whether it goes to cover the opposite

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.610 
whether it goes to cover the opposite
way<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.479> know<00:05:39.539> it's<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.960> think<00:05:40.229> that<00:05:40.260> would<00:05:40.500> be

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
way you know it's I think that would be

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.580 
way you know it's I think that would be
a<00:05:40.650> really<00:05:40.970> worthwhile<00:05:41.970> thing<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.690> do<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.260> to

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
a really worthwhile thing to do is to

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.060 
a really worthwhile thing to do is to
really<00:05:43.889> pick<00:05:44.460> apart<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:45.060> music<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:46.710> separate

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
really pick apart the music to separate

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.540 
really pick apart the music to separate
it<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.370> then<00:05:48.560> watching<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.770> film<00:05:49.950> as<00:05:50.099> well<00:05:50.250> to

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
it and then watching the film as well to

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.550 
it and then watching the film as well to
kind<00:05:50.700> of<00:05:50.789> see<00:05:51.000> how<00:05:51.150> they<00:05:51.330> intertwine<00:05:52.229> because

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
kind of see how they intertwine because

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.839 
kind of see how they intertwine because
that's<00:05:52.710> something<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:53.490> know<00:05:53.580> I've<00:05:53.729> been

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
that's something you know I've been

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.540 
that's something you know I've been
listening<00:05:54.000> to<00:05:54.240> film<00:05:54.660> music<00:05:54.990> quite<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.470> lot<00:05:55.620> but

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
listening to film music quite a lot but

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.089 
listening to film music quite a lot but
that's<00:05:56.760> totally<00:05:57.300> on<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.750> end<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:57.960> just<00:05:58.199> you

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
that's totally on the end of just you

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.350 
that's totally on the end of just you
know<00:05:59.130> learning<00:05:59.430> how<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.669> make<00:05:59.910> a<00:05:59.940> peaceful

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
know learning how to make a peaceful

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.089 
know learning how to make a peaceful
music<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.720> sounds<00:06:00.990> nice<00:06:01.139> and<00:06:01.680> that's<00:06:01.860> great

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
music that sounds nice and that's great

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.050 
music that sounds nice and that's great
but<00:06:03.349> what<00:06:04.349> meeting<00:06:05.130> with<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.430> composer's

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
but what meeting with the composer's

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.189 
but what meeting with the composer's
showed<00:06:06.449> me<00:06:06.599> is<00:06:06.780> that<00:06:06.960> that<00:06:07.760> while<00:06:08.760> it<00:06:08.910> may<00:06:09.030> be

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
showed me is that that while it may be

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.839 
showed me is that that while it may be
important<00:06:10.199> to<00:06:10.380> be<00:06:10.500> able<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.889> express<00:06:11.639> your

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
important to be able to express your

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.469 
important to be able to express your
ideas<00:06:11.970> musically<00:06:12.979> that<00:06:13.979> is<00:06:14.190> not<00:06:14.430> all<00:06:15.419> that

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
ideas musically that is not all that

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.050 
ideas musically that is not all that
there<00:06:16.289> is<00:06:16.320> to<00:06:16.410> it<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:17.400> have<00:06:17.550> to<00:06:17.699> be<00:06:17.820> able<00:06:17.910> to

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
there is to it you have to be able to

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.260 
there is to it you have to be able to
write<00:06:18.210> something<00:06:18.449> that<00:06:18.690> sounds<00:06:18.990> good<00:06:19.250> but

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
write something that sounds good but

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.879 
write something that sounds good but
that<00:06:21.270> is<00:06:21.419> less<00:06:21.570> important<00:06:22.110> than<00:06:22.199> whether<00:06:22.740> it

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
that is less important than whether it

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.159 
that is less important than whether it
fits<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.580> that's<00:06:23.760> that's<00:06:24.630> seen<00:06:24.960> all<00:06:25.080> right

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
fits and that's that's seen all right

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.839 
fits and that's that's seen all right
like<00:06:25.349> I<00:06:25.500> keep<00:06:25.680> saying<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:26.099> but<00:06:26.160> that<00:06:26.340> is<00:06:26.490> really

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
like I keep saying it but that is really

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.180 
like I keep saying it but that is really
the<00:06:27.030> most<00:06:27.750> important<00:06:28.260> thing<00:06:28.410> and<00:06:29.039> you<00:06:29.160> know

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
the most important thing and you know

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.610 
the most important thing and you know
this<00:06:29.430> can<00:06:29.610> go<00:06:29.760> against<00:06:30.630> some<00:06:31.020> of<00:06:31.139> those<00:06:31.289> ideas

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
this can go against some of those ideas

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.180 
this can go against some of those ideas
that<00:06:32.070> you<00:06:32.160> may<00:06:32.310> expect<00:06:32.669> to<00:06:33.630> have<00:06:33.780> in<00:06:33.930> music<00:06:34.830> so

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
that you may expect to have in music so

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.659 
that you may expect to have in music so
you<00:06:35.250> can<00:06:35.490> have<00:06:35.669> random<00:06:36.539> tempo<00:06:36.990> changes<00:06:37.669> so

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
you can have random tempo changes so

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:39.590 
you can have random tempo changes so
that<00:06:38.700> it<00:06:38.969> fits

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
that it fits

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.960 
that it fits
with<00:06:39.870> the<00:06:39.990> piece<00:06:40.200> again<00:06:41.070> if<00:06:41.370> you<00:06:41.520> make<00:06:41.670> it<00:06:41.700> too

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
with the piece again if you make it too

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.760 
with the piece again if you make it too
obvious<00:06:42.000> then<00:06:42.540> it<00:06:42.660> will<00:06:42.810> draw<00:06:43.380> attention<00:06:43.590> to

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
obvious then it will draw attention to

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.700 
obvious then it will draw attention to
the<00:06:43.920> music<00:06:44.220> but<00:06:44.790> to<00:06:45.030> change<00:06:45.480> the<00:06:45.660> tempo<00:06:46.050> as

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
the music but to change the tempo as

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.800 
the music but to change the tempo as
long<00:06:47.310> as<00:06:47.460> your<00:06:47.610> long<00:06:48.210> as<00:06:48.300> you<00:06:48.390> realize<00:06:48.540> the

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
long as your long as you realize the

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.570 
long as your long as you realize the
effect<00:06:48.900> that<00:06:49.080> that's<00:06:49.290> going<00:06:49.410> to<00:06:49.470> have<00:06:49.680> that<00:06:50.460> is

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
effect that that's going to have that is

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.280 
effect that that's going to have that is
something<00:06:50.820> that's<00:06:50.940> a<00:06:51.240> very<00:06:51.600> useful<00:06:52.080> thing

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
something that's a very useful thing

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.170 
something that's a very useful thing
which<00:06:52.620> i<00:06:52.710> was<00:06:52.830> thinking<00:06:53.160> like<00:06:53.190> you<00:06:53.340> know<00:06:53.490> maybe

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
which i was thinking like you know maybe

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.340 
which i was thinking like you know maybe
we<00:06:54.270> just<00:06:54.420> want<00:06:54.570> to<00:06:54.630> have<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.810> same<00:06:54.960> tempo

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
we just want to have the same tempo

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.020 
we just want to have the same tempo
throughout<00:06:55.590> the<00:06:55.680> whole<00:06:55.770> thing<00:06:55.980> you<00:06:56.790> can<00:06:56.910> do

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
throughout the whole thing you can do

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.060 
throughout the whole thing you can do
key<00:06:57.240> changes<00:06:57.810> you<00:06:58.440> can<00:06:58.560> do<00:06:58.710> all<00:06:58.740> these

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
key changes you can do all these

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.970 
key changes you can do all these
techniques<00:06:59.820> um<00:07:00.320> that<00:07:01.320> maybe<00:07:01.560> you<00:07:01.740> wouldn't

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
techniques um that maybe you wouldn't

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.430 
techniques um that maybe you wouldn't
find<00:07:02.160> in<00:07:02.370> a<00:07:02.430> pop<00:07:02.640> song<00:07:02.850> you<00:07:03.660> can<00:07:03.810> use<00:07:03.960> all<00:07:04.170> of

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
find in a pop song you can use all of

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.660 
find in a pop song you can use all of
these<00:07:04.590> but<00:07:05.580> have<00:07:05.820> them<00:07:06.030> as<00:07:06.240> part<00:07:06.870> of<00:07:06.930> your

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.670 
these but have them as part of your

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.530 
these but have them as part of your
palate<00:07:08.670> to<00:07:08.790> choose<00:07:09.000> from<00:07:09.210> of<00:07:09.450> how<00:07:10.080> to<00:07:10.140> get<00:07:10.440> the

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
palate to choose from of how to get the

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.990 
palate to choose from of how to get the
emotion<00:07:12.540> and<00:07:12.750> the<00:07:12.980> effect<00:07:13.980> out<00:07:14.340> of<00:07:14.760> what's

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
emotion and the effect out of what's

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.590 
emotion and the effect out of what's
going<00:07:15.240> on<00:07:15.510> in<00:07:15.780> the<00:07:15.930> film<00:07:16.140> and<00:07:16.880> yeah<00:07:17.880> so<00:07:18.120> it's

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
going on in the film and yeah so it's

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.290
