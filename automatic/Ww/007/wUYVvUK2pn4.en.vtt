to get special matchmaking they are

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.330 
to get special matchmaking they are
always<00:00:26.760> talked<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.500> cannot<00:00:28.710> CT<00:00:29.220> or

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
always talked here and they cannot CT or

always talked here and they cannot CT or
five<00:00:29.519> tanks<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.179> tier<00:00:30.420> 6<00:00:30.750> Hanks<00:00:31.399> just<00:00:32.399> tier<00:00:32.550> 4

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
five tanks or tier 6 Hanks just tier 4

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
five tanks or tier 6 Hanks just tier 4
so<00:00:34.320> obviously<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> b2<00:00:35.070> being<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> heavy<00:00:35.610> tank<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
so obviously the b2 being a heavy tank I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.740 
so obviously the b2 being a heavy tank I
get<00:00:36.450> placed<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> top<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> list<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
get placed at the top of the list and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
get placed at the top of the list and
cons<00:00:39.750> Oh<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> light<00:00:40.260> tank<00:00:40.500> gets<00:00:40.649> placed<00:00:40.980> near

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
cons Oh on a light tank gets placed near

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.720 
cons Oh on a light tank gets placed near
the<00:00:41.190> bottom<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> Valentine<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the bottom but the Valentine to is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.990 
the bottom but the Valentine to is
pretty<00:00:45.390> heavily<00:00:45.629> armored<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.680> fact<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.730> Abby

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
pretty heavily armored in fact if Abby

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.750 
pretty heavily armored in fact if Abby
to<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.539> believe<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.559> Abby<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.039> were<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> shoot

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to I believe if Abby to were to shoot

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
to I believe if Abby to were to shoot
regular<00:00:51.390> ammunition<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> Valentine<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
regular ammunition at a Valentine to it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
regular ammunition at a Valentine to it
would<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.010> penetrate<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.550> any<00:00:53.820> site<00:00:54.090> unless

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
would not penetrate on any site unless

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.130 
would not penetrate on any site unless
it<00:00:54.660> found<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.430> significant<00:00:56.430> weak<00:00:56.550> point<00:00:56.989> we<00:00:57.989> are

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it found a significant weak point we are

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.950 
it found a significant weak point we are
heading<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.680> south<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.660> hopefully<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
heading down south and hopefully we can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
heading down south and hopefully we can
cut<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.289> any<00:01:01.530> enemy<00:01:01.859> tanks<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.399> trying<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
cut off any enemy tanks are trying to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.939 
cut off any enemy tanks are trying to
get<00:01:02.879> through<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> middle<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:03.899> r<00:01:04.229> m8a1

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
get through the middle bit where r m8a1

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.940 
get through the middle bit where r m8a1
is<00:01:05.400> situated<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> b2<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:10.080> seems<00:01:10.530> kind

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is situated the b2 is of it seems kind

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.310 
is situated the b2 is of it seems kind
of<00:01:11.010> slow<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> maneuverability<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of slow but the maneuverability or the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.700 
of slow but the maneuverability or the
whole<00:01:14.070> Traverse<00:01:14.460> actually<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.060> should<00:01:15.330> say<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
whole Traverse actually I should say is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.300 
whole Traverse actually I should say is
pretty<00:01:16.710> decent<00:01:17.990> main<00:01:18.990> weakness<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.009> tank

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
pretty decent main weakness of this tank

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.270 
pretty decent main weakness of this tank
I<00:01:20.610> believe<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> cannon<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.159> have

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
I believe is the cannon it doesn't have

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.649 
I believe is the cannon it doesn't have
a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.490> penetration<00:01:23.939> doesn't<00:01:24.330> deal<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> lot

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
a lot of penetration doesn't deal a lot

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
a lot of penetration doesn't deal a lot
of<00:01:24.810> damage<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.439> does<00:01:25.590> reload<00:01:26.159> fairly

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of damage but it does reload fairly

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.999 
of damage but it does reload fairly
quickly<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.229> quickly<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.410 

aiming<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.400> pretty<00:01:32.880> good

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.469 

I'll<00:01:36.140> let<00:01:36.380> our<00:01:36.650> French<00:01:37.189> be<00:01:37.460> one<00:01:37.700> take<00:01:38.150> this

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
I'll let our French be one take this

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.899 
I'll let our French be one take this
side<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:39.110> taking<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.710> look<00:01:39.950> see<00:01:40.580> if<00:01:40.610> anything

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
side just taking a look see if anything

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.050 
side just taking a look see if anything
pops<00:01:40.939> up<00:01:41.890> there's<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.979> t28<00:01:43.430> I'm<00:01:43.670> going<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.880> cut

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
pops up there's a t28 I'm going to cut

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.480 
pops up there's a t28 I'm going to cut
across<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.720> go<00:01:45.229> behind<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:47.930> little

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
across and go behind that little

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.700 
across and go behind that little
mountain<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.640> suppose<00:01:52.479> taking<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.690> shot<00:01:54.409> on<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
mountain I suppose taking a shot on the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.359 
mountain I suppose taking a shot on the
move<00:01:54.890> at<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.220> teach<00:01:55.520> 18<00:01:55.789> over<00:01:56.090> there<00:01:56.509> and

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
move at that teach 18 over there and

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.429 
move at that teach 18 over there and
back<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.549> my<00:01:58.670> original<00:01:58.820> target<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.630> this<00:01:59.780> t28

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
back to my original target of this t28

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:09.499 
back to my original target of this t28
hiding<00:02:01.130> behind<00:02:01.280> here

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.839 

now<00:02:10.080> unfortunately<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.799> did<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.250> spotted

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
now unfortunately I did get spotted

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.970 
now unfortunately I did get spotted
right<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:13.049> while<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.319> was<00:02:13.500> crossing<00:02:13.680> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
right there while I was crossing that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.569 
right there while I was crossing that
little<00:02:14.220> gap<00:02:14.540> um<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> did<00:02:16.829> I<00:02:17.040> guess<00:02:17.459> it

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
little gap um but it did I guess it

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:25.190 
little gap um but it did I guess it
doesn't<00:02:17.819> really<00:02:17.849> matter<00:02:18.150> right<00:02:18.299> now

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.790 

the<00:02:26.099> biggest<00:02:26.400> enemy<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.140> b2<00:02:28.560> or

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the biggest enemy I think to the b2 or

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
the biggest enemy I think to the b2 or
the<00:02:28.920> tank<00:02:29.640> destroyers<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> lot<00:02:30.360> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
the tank destroyers a lot of

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.380 
the tank destroyers a lot of
penetrations<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.010> marder<00:02:32.400> 38t<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:33.030> over

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
penetrations so the marder 38t is over

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.280 
penetrations so the marder 38t is over
there<00:02:33.599> are<00:02:34.489> fairly<00:02:35.489> big<00:02:35.730> problem<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.140> can

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
there are fairly big problem as you can

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.680 
there are fairly big problem as you can
see<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> t28<00:02:38.099> here<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.879> having<00:02:39.209> actually<00:02:39.629> a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
see the t28 here is having actually a
