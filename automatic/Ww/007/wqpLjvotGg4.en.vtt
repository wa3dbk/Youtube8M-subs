102.9<00:01:48.229> 85<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.619> let's<00:01:52.159> see<00:01:52.310> chassis<00:01:52.820> is<00:01:52.880> 201

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
102.9 85 and let's see chassis is 201

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.160 
102.9 85 and let's see chassis is 201
model<00:01:54.649> 201<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:57.049> engine<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.469> 102<00:01:58.420> 0.985<00:01:59.420> okay

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
model 201 the engine is a 102 0.985 okay

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.139 
model 201 the engine is a 102 0.985 okay
so<00:02:01.130> they<00:02:01.280> differ<00:02:02.049> basically<00:02:03.049> in<00:02:03.200> line<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:04.149> top

I need a fourth hand anyway I just got
off<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> minute<00:04:16.919> ago<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.280> then<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.700> do<00:04:18.180> a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
off a minute ago so then you do a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.440 
off a minute ago so then you do a
torquing<00:04:18.810> action<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.490> if<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.730> push<00:04:24.090> on

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
torquing action so you if you push on

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.440 
torquing action so you if you push on
this<00:04:25.230> squeeze<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.190> channellocks<00:04:26.669> squeeze<00:04:27.210> on

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
this squeeze the channellocks squeeze on

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.640 
this squeeze the channellocks squeeze on
it<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.190> push<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.550> way<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:31.380> you

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
it and push it that way and then you

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.390 
it and push it that way and then you
pull<00:04:32.220> on<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.389> wrench<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:34.080> way<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.530> torquing

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
pull on the wrench this way a torquing

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.060 
pull on the wrench this way a torquing
motion<00:04:35.810> one<00:04:36.810> comes<00:04:37.110> towards<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.889> wrench

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
motion one comes towards you the wrench

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.210 
motion one comes towards you the wrench
comes<00:04:38.250> towards<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:40.070> channel<00:04:41.070> locks

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
comes towards you and the channel locks

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.110 
comes towards you and the channel locks
go<00:04:41.460> bye-bye

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
go bye-bye

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.159 
go bye-bye
so<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:42.960> pull<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.290> Meuse<00:04:43.470> there<00:04:44.360> hold<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.600> and

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
so you pull the Meuse there hold it and

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:54.680 
so you pull the Meuse there hold it and
then<00:04:47.810> boom<00:04:50.630> man<00:04:51.630> got<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.590> loose<00:04:53.150> it's<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.270> normal

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
then boom man got it loose it's a normal

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.659 
then boom man got it loose it's a normal
thread<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:57.710> counter<00:04:58.710> all<00:04:59.460> right
