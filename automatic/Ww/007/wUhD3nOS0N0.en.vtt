more<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> scene<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.810> terms<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.199> racing<00:00:22.410> but

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
more on the scene in terms of racing but

to run kit and so I decided I'd give it
a<00:00:28.199> review<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> kit<00:00:29.070> guy<00:00:29.330> I<00:00:30.330> would

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
a review I'm not a kit guy I would

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.139

battery babe in terms of a race
standpoint<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.640> hated<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.569> bashing

standpoint I hated it for bashing

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.509 
standpoint I hated it for bashing
because<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.470> took<00:02:40.590> forever<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.980> take<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.370> off

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
because it took forever to take it off

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.690 
because it took forever to take it off
and<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.440> if<00:02:43.739> you're<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> basher<00:02:44.430> you're

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and you know if you're a basher you're

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.880 
and you know if you're a basher you're
swapping<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.269> out<00:02:45.390> batteries<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.769> know

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
swapping in and out batteries you know

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
swapping in and out batteries you know
you're<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.069> having<00:02:47.519> fun<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> get

annoying<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> small<00:02:49.739> thing<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.069> don't<00:02:50.300> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
annoying it's a small thing I don't the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.059 
annoying it's a small thing I don't the
tires<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:51.840> pretty<00:02:51.989> weak<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.530> bashing<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
tires are pretty weak for bashing I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.789 
tires are pretty weak for bashing I
think<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:54.150> limited<00:02:54.660> run<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.319> Front's<00:02:55.680> are

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
think in limited run the Front's are

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.920 
think in limited run the Front's are
actually<00:02:56.130> pretty<00:02:56.340> worn<00:02:56.610> already<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.660> rears

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
actually pretty worn already the rears

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.970 
actually pretty worn already the rears
held<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.350> fine<00:02:58.819> but<00:02:59.819> if<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> were<00:03:00.120> gonna<00:03:00.209> race

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
held up fine but if you were gonna race

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.680 
held up fine but if you were gonna race
you<00:03:01.980> would<00:03:02.130> or<00:03:02.370> bash<00:03:02.580> really<00:03:03.000> new<00:03:03.480> set<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
you would or bash really new set of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.160 
you would or bash really new set of
tires<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.440> generally<00:03:05.069> kind<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.430> status<00:03:05.760> quo<00:03:06.170> in

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
tires is generally kind of status quo in

this kit I think does a great job given
its<00:03:31.109> price<00:03:31.320> point<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.859> mean<00:03:32.180> yes<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.420> probably

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
its price point I mean yes it's probably

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.020 
its price point I mean yes it's probably
at<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> foot<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.140> know<00:03:34.230> $400<00:03:34.859> price<00:03:35.130> mark<00:03:35.459> but

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
at a foot you know $400 price mark but

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.970 
at a foot you know $400 price mark but
you're<00:03:36.810> gonna<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> kid<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.890> you

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
you're gonna have a kid here that you

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.170 
you're gonna have a kid here that you
can<00:03:38.130> basically<00:03:38.310> throw<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.760> out<00:03:38.850> on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.970> track

you<00:03:55.590> want<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.769> upgrade<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.130> steering<00:03:56.430> servo

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
you want to upgrade the steering servo

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.280 
you want to upgrade the steering servo
or<00:03:56.940> something<00:03:57.239> like<00:03:57.359> that<00:03:57.420> eventually<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.079> put

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
or something like that eventually I put

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.830 
or something like that eventually I put
a<00:03:58.319> different<00:03:58.500> power<00:03:59.250> system<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.850> there<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.690> if

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
a different power system in there but if

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.789 
a different power system in there but if
you're<00:04:00.930> thinking<00:04:01.230> about<00:04:01.319> doing<00:04:01.500> both<00:04:01.739> of

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you're thinking about doing both of

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.530 
you're thinking about doing both of
those<00:04:02.040> things<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.549> recommend<00:04:02.730> getting<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.299> kit

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
those things I recommend getting the kit

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.420 
those things I recommend getting the kit

perfect

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.490 
perfect
for<00:04:27.419> racing<00:04:27.720> right<00:04:27.840> out<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.139> box<00:04:28.289> you

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
for racing right out of the box you

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.809 
for racing right out of the box you
probably<00:04:28.919> would<00:04:29.069> have<00:04:29.099> gotten<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.430> five<00:04:29.639> out<00:04:29.789> of

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
probably would have gotten a five out of

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.270 
probably would have gotten a five out of
five<00:04:30.090> or<00:04:30.780> very<00:04:31.139> close<00:04:31.349> to<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.650> five<00:04:31.830> out<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.009> five

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
five or very close to a five out of five

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.730

half big more shocks that's 80 bucks

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.879 
half big more shocks that's 80 bucks
you<00:04:53.370> know<00:04:53.490> motor<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.180> ESC<00:04:54.500> hundred<00:04:55.500> bucks

it<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:00.599> I<00:05:00.629> think<00:05:00.840> value<00:05:01.440> wise<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.919> great<00:05:02.250> I

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
it so I think value wise it's a great I

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.629 
it so I think value wise it's a great I
mean<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.389> can't<00:05:03.900> see<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.259> would<00:05:04.560> 20<00:05:04.919> 30<00:05:05.159> 40<00:05:05.550> bucks

mean I can't see it would 20 30 40 bucks

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.809 
mean I can't see it would 20 30 40 bucks

so<00:05:34.529> take<00:05:35.219> that<00:05:35.250> rating<00:05:35.759> kind<00:05:36.029> of<00:05:36.120> with<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> grain

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
so take that rating kind of with a grain

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.620 
so take that rating kind of with a grain
of<00:05:36.509> salt<00:05:36.779> i<00:05:36.960> think<00:05:37.169> on<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:37.319> track<00:05:38.270> if<00:05:39.270> i<00:05:39.449> only
