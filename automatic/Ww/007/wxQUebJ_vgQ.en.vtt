00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.560 
quite impressed with this windows 7
especially<00:00:40.309> since<00:00:40.489> i<00:00:40.580> was<00:00:40.730> running<00:00:40.940> vista

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
especially since i was running vista

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.290 
especially since i was running vista
pretty<00:00:41.809> much<00:00:41.989> since<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.410> original<00:00:42.650> release

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
pretty much since the original release

pretty much since the original release
so<00:00:44.300> anyhow<00:00:44.570> let's<00:00:44.750> go<00:00:44.840> ahead<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.050> get<00:00:45.380> started

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
so anyhow let's go ahead and get started

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.670 
so anyhow let's go ahead and get started
with<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.100> most<00:00:47.059> noticeable<00:00:47.899> difference<00:00:48.469> when

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
with the most noticeable difference when

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.420 
with the most noticeable difference when
once<00:00:49.160> your<00:00:49.370> computer<00:00:49.760> boots<00:00:50.030> up<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:52.129> task

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
once your computer boots up a this task

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.150 
once your computer boots up a this task
bar<00:00:52.640> right<00:00:52.790> here<00:00:53.200> you<00:00:54.200> can<00:00:54.350> see<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:54.739> much

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
bar right here you can see it's much

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.180 
bar right here you can see it's much
larger<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:56.600> also<00:00:56.780> has<00:00:57.320> your<00:00:57.649> quick<00:00:57.950> launch

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
larger and it also has your quick launch

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.660 
larger and it also has your quick launch
applications<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:59.180> little<00:00:59.870> bit<00:00:59.960> differently

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
applications a little bit differently

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
applications a little bit differently
instead<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.820> them<00:01:02.000> just<00:01:02.239> launching<00:01:02.629> an

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
instead of them just launching an

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.150 
instead of them just launching an
application<00:01:03.170> they<00:01:03.320> actually<00:01:03.590> groups<00:01:03.949> your

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
application they actually groups your

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.889 
application they actually groups your
applications<00:01:04.729> right<00:01:04.910> there<00:01:05.149> so<00:01:05.570> if<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:05.780> can

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
applications right there so if you can

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.090 
applications right there so if you can
see<00:01:06.050> when<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.259> open<00:01:06.500> up<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.710> Firefox<00:01:07.340> window<00:01:07.520> it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
see when I open up a Firefox window it

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.770 
see when I open up a Firefox window it
groups<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.250> right<00:01:10.369> here<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:11.509> I<00:01:11.570> click<00:01:11.630> it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
groups it right here and if I click it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.450 
groups it right here and if I click it
again<00:01:11.930> it's<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:12.320> going<00:01:12.649> to<00:01:12.830> minimize<00:01:13.280> it

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
again it's just going to minimize it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.070 
again it's just going to minimize it
because<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.850> becomes<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.300> actual<00:01:14.720> launched

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
because it becomes the actual launched

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.620 
because it becomes the actual launched
application<00:01:15.880> it's<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:17.000> little<00:01:17.150> bit<00:01:17.270> annoying

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
application it's a little bit annoying

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.710 
application it's a little bit annoying
but<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.920> for<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.400> better<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.210> open<00:01:20.540> new

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
but it's for the better so to open new

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.359 
but it's for the better so to open new
Firefox<00:01:21.200> window<00:01:21.409> I'd<00:01:21.619> have<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.890> come<00:01:22.070> into<00:01:22.220> the
