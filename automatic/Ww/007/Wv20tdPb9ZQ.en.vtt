00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:06.950
嘿 YouTube users are Charlie and this weekend is the end of the walking dead. I already 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.679
 I did a lot of X, Y, I predicted in the previous video, so this time I think this will be 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.679
 Ask a question interestingly. How did you surpass last year's finale at Woodbury and mid-season 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:19.330
 At last? 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.890
 How do you increase the level of intensity, not just increase the number of X people? 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 More tanks? The answer is very simple, you make things more intimate, you change 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.670
 Ways to fundamentally change the way they are perceived by you and your core characters 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.550
 Me and other characters in the show. 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.219
 What does it mean? So first we have to see what went in the past 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.210
 Finale, then compare it, everyone is emotional, and now use the data as a guide. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.010
 So let's take a look at the facts from the finale of Season 3. 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.969
 No. 1 - There is the Governor. The black hat is wearing a villain. He is actually putting 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.730
 Complaint that the show lacks a central villain and bounces back for the audience 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.050
 All over the place. Its work, the show became more popular. 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.990
 In the middle of the season, the final should really consider his arc at the end of the show. So what is 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.390
 To take the place of Darth Vader in Georgia, what is going on here to take 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 Place Andre Milton elements. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 You must have a wide threat group and a very close threat to you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.909
 Love. 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.659
 Number 2 - Comics. The source of all walkers. 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.290
 You can't have a comic story about a walking show that doesn't solve the TV show. 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 The writer is literally adapted to the comics that make the plot. That said a lot of words 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.939
 Various reasons why things have changed. This is what we found ourselves now. 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.240
 We've got some new people in a new place, headed by a very ominous feeling of Gareth characters. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.100
 Suddenly, it almost sounds like the exact same sequence of events will unfold. here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.619
 We can confirm. 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.850
 Gareth is a remarkable comic book that Robert Kirkman called "an interesting turn" 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.490
 character. If Abraham, Eugene and Rosita are any indicators. Man Gareth is similar 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.399
 It will be very close to someone who is like a comic in an actor. It can be anything at 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.039
 There are at least four characters. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.080
 Robert Kirkman makes it sound like his one character has only one spin. So even if they do this 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.120
 Combining a few things, I think we can guess that we want to localize and show the people around us. 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.739
 The story there is now. 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.870
 This led to the hunter. 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.020
 The terminus is not directly from the comic book, but it looks like 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.700
 Before the last stop, Alexander, this also supported the theory of hunters. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 No. 3 - The hunter at the terminus 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.470
 So, if you have such a very similar situation, the end of the season 3, what happened to you? 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.950
 The way to do this is not just to add more guns, more tanks, and more walkers. 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.900
 And not just to change to another Sith Lord. 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.209
 I think it's really important to remember the situation of Andre Milton. 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.340
 We never saw him turn over her in the state. They chose not to show us this, 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.379
 But more focused on the governor and his killing machine gun, just the mowing 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.959
 Come down. 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.069
 So, I think what happens is that they will shift focus and the maximum ratio. 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.790
 This story will be in a locked room. When I said, I just used this word 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 Things as metaphors are terrible. You can't think of such a thing for a few days. 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.170
 A group of murderers is realtively abstract, but Andre’s situation is very personal and 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.909
 Very caring. So this is more difficult to get rid of. 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.900
 Number 4 - Breakthrough point 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.670
 Rick will be a break in this episode. This is to say that "Rick comes with 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.409
 Face to face and shocking atrocities threaten everyone's life. "Nature 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.750
 This means he will have to take a page from the governor's book and eliminate 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.580
 Threat. 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.989
 He has been a farmer Rick for most seasons. But remember what Carroll said before they split. 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.860
 "You can be a farmer, you can't just be a farmer." One of the reasons for Carl Sniper 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.610
 Out of him in episode 9 because he will become so ineffective as his new result 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.750
 The chosen major. 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.650
 And this really old chess metaphor, the best way is not to move. Means the best 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.650
 If you take action for everyone, you will not take action. But I think people get 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.150
 need to be able to do this. At least without paying the price. 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 What does this mean? Rick is cruelly killing a lot of people in true zero-distance contact. 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.560
 Personal way. If you want to see if this looks like in comics, read question 57. it 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.199
 Dealing with the predator. I think this is represented by Qiao Qun. 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.770
 I also think that Rick's atrocities will overlap with crazy people at the terminus. 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.050
 Number 5 - The terminus is not a good place 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.550
 Even the despicable villain Joe agreed that the terminus was bad news. Tell you everything you need to know. 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.699
 In addition, there are Michonne's paintings and the similarities between Mary and the fact that Mary is 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.320
 She was kidnapped when she was wearing a poncho like Beth. Red warning light 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.120
 Flashing everywhere. All these yellow flowers are in the darkness of the Walker Venus flight trap. 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.620
 This is a major threat to the Group and it has begun to play a role. All the evidence shows 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.330
 Even if people at the terminus are not the hunter’s carbon, they are practicing 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.970
 Cannibals. This means that not only will the survivors die, they will be eaten. Either completely 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.150
 Or just a part. 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.660
 From the comics all this has bent a lot of things, but the same terminus and Gareth are completely 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.169
 Inspired by new comics. 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.830
 The real conversation is now part of who eats or letss eat. 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.350
 6 - The prediction of the final death. 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.350
 Maggie Cheung is still the best guess I have based on the rumors and things from the comics just now. 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.389
 Was flipped. Remember, how did you top the scene with Andre? You told it to play it out 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.100
 Excrutiating details are more precious than people. It can be any number 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.199
 This character is in the late series. But Beth, Carol, Glen, they are all marked. 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.569
 I think everyone wants Rick to limping away, but he may be a 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.910
 Those who eat these parts. 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.880
 So now let me know how you will top the season 3 finals and the prison massacre. doing what 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.889
 You think this ending must be bigger and not just repeat the same thing. 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.639
 Seriously, I just want to see Darryl save Beth and cut some people. It can be completely 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.210
 What happens if he steals another poncho. Those ponchos doubled his crit rating and 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.580
 crossbow. Bombing head, headshot boom. 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.910
 I will post my finale review episode this Sunday. Be sure to subscribe 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.639
 get it. I also made a double gift. Two people will win the Amazon gift card instead of 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.270
 one. 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.539
 I will also make my 5th season prediction video for my post Q&amp;A next week. 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.830
