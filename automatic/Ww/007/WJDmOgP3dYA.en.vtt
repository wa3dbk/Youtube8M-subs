00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
necklace it's not a little bit there the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.850 
necklace it's not a little bit there the
bit<00:00:37.070> that<00:00:37.100> goes<00:00:37.370> clicky<00:00:37.700> clicky<00:00:38.000> ah<00:00:38.710> good<00:00:39.710> let

bit that goes clicky clicky ah good let

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.790 
bit that goes clicky clicky ah good let
your<00:00:40.719> little<00:00:41.719> wire<00:00:41.960> connector<00:00:42.380> on<00:00:42.469> there<00:00:42.649> a

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
your little wire connector on there a

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.310 
your little wire connector on there a
little<00:00:42.860> bit<00:00:43.340> of<00:00:43.460> wire<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:44.899> then<00:00:45.079> what<00:00:45.170> we're

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
little bit of wire and then what we're

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.639 
little bit of wire and then what we're
going<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.500> do<00:00:46.899> is<00:00:47.899> it<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:48.379> drilled<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.620> little

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
going to do is it you drilled a little

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.459 
going to do is it you drilled a little
hole<00:00:48.920> to<00:00:49.760> glue<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.089> into<00:00:50.480> an<00:00:50.719> even<00:00:51.170> smaller

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
hole to glue that into an even smaller

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.790 
hole to glue that into an even smaller
hole<00:00:51.980> for<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.280> wire<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.760> go<00:00:52.910> through<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:54.589> when

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
hole for the wire to go through and when

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000 
hole for the wire to go through and when
it's<00:00:54.949> all<00:00:55.070> in<00:00:55.249> there<00:00:56.230> so<00:00:57.230> there's<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.559> tube<00:00:57.800> it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's all in there so there's the tube it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.290 
it's all in there so there's the tube it
be<00:00:58.190> like<00:00:58.339> that<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:58.999> then<00:00:59.839> you<00:00:59.960> bend<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> wire

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
be like that and then you bend the wire

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.620 
be like that and then you bend the wire
around<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:04.040> when<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.280> click<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.699> get<00:01:05.570> a

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
around so when you click it you get a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.680 
around so when you click it you get a
little<00:01:05.810> spark<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:10.280> what<00:01:10.430> we've<00:01:10.520> done<00:01:10.690> we've

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
little spark so what we've done we've

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.090 
little spark so what we've done we've
got<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.930> trigger<00:01:12.260> put<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.620> little<00:01:12.740> bit<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:12.920> wire

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
got the trigger put a little bit of wire

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.330 
got the trigger put a little bit of wire
on<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:14.090> now<00:01:14.210> we've<00:01:14.390> era<00:01:14.659> died<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.340> our

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
on it and now we've era died in our

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.920 
on it and now we've era died in our
diets<00:01:16.729> good<00:01:16.880> because<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.180> goes<00:01:17.300> off<00:01:17.479> hard<00:01:17.720> it

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
diets good because it goes off hard it

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.840 
diets good because it goes off hard it
goes<00:01:18.050> off<00:01:18.229> quick<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.890> doesn't<00:01:19.100> combustor

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
goes off quick and it doesn't combustor

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.690 
goes off quick and it doesn't combustor

is wait for that to dry and when it's
dry<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.670> bend<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:44.120> wire<00:01:44.360> up<00:01:44.660> so<00:01:45.410> it's<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
dry you bend that wire up so it's just a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.140 
dry you bend that wire up so it's just a
little<00:01:45.980> tiny<00:01:46.160> bit<00:01:46.280> away<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.030> go

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
little tiny bit away and then you go

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.880 
little tiny bit away and then you go
back

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.760 

so<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.350> glued<00:01:54.680> got<00:01:55.680> the
