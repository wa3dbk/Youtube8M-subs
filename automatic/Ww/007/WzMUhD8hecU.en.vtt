00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
now that we've swab the points we can go

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.900 
now that we've swab the points we can go
ahead<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:22.560> our<00:00:22.710> single-use<00:00:23.189> needles<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
ahead and get our single-use needles to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.670 
ahead and get our single-use needles to
perform<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.600> bit<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> acupuncture<00:00:25.470> so

in his back and a few of them we're

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.880 
in his back and a few of them we're
going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> work<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> meridians<00:00:31.740> or

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
going to work more on the meridians or

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.100 
going to work more on the meridians or
the<00:00:32.009> lines<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.430> energy<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> acupuncture

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the lines of energy that the acupuncture

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.830 
the lines of energy that the acupuncture
needles<00:00:34.380> work<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.660> we're<00:00:36.660> using

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
needles work so well with so we're using

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740 
needles work so well with so we're using
the<00:00:37.020> filiform<00:00:37.469> needles<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.910> we're<00:00:39.629> just

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the filiform needles and we're just

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.770 
the filiform needles and we're just
going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.020> palpate<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> find<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.280> good<00:00:41.460> spot

going to palpate and find a good spot
and<00:00:43.250> tap<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.239> bit

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and tap that in and just do a little bit

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
and tap that in and just do a little bit
of<00:00:48.570> stimulation<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.410> he<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> feed<00:00:49.980> give<00:00:50.160> us

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of stimulation and he can feed give us

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
of stimulation and he can feed give us
some<00:00:50.430> feedback<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.059> he<00:00:51.180> gets<00:00:51.360> any<00:00:51.510> sensation

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
some feedback if he gets any sensation

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840 
some feedback if he gets any sensation
there<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.620> than<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.890> first<00:00:53.160> initial<00:00:53.399> tap

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
there other than that first initial tap

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.420 
there other than that first initial tap
he'll<00:00:54.570> let<00:00:54.870> us<00:00:54.899> know<00:01:00.500> good<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.039> those<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:02.399> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
he'll let us know good so those are just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.880 
he'll let us know good so those are just
some<00:01:02.670> local<00:01:02.940> area<00:01:03.420> points<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.019> we're<00:01:04.170> doing

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.500 

these<00:01:07.890> points<00:01:08.369> also<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.180> great

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
these points also have some great

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.100 
these points also have some great
effects<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> various<00:01:11.790> organs<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.570> well

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
effects on the various organs as well

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
effects on the various organs as well
when<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> Chinese<00:01:13.530> energetic<00:01:14.220> organs<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
when the Chinese energetic organs are a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
when the Chinese energetic organs are a
little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.119> different<00:01:15.509> from<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> real

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
little bit different from the real

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
little bit different from the real
organs<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.000> only

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
organs so with this we're not only

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120 
organs so with this we're not only
helping<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:18.810> pain<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.380> spasm<00:01:19.740> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
helping them with some pain in spasm but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
helping them with some pain in spasm but
we're<00:01:20.610> actually<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> help<00:01:21.330> his<00:01:21.540> Chinese

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
we're actually going to help his Chinese

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.630 
we're actually going to help his Chinese
energetic<00:01:22.470> liver<00:01:22.770> which<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.430> help<00:01:23.520> with

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
energetic liver which will help with

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910 
energetic liver which will help with
stress<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:25.080> sitting<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.500> front<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
stress which sitting in front of this

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
stress which sitting in front of this
camera<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.490> him<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.759> probably<00:01:26.970> slightly

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
camera for him is probably slightly

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.929 
camera for him is probably slightly
stressful<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.900> point<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.560> call<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.070> 14<00:01:35.670> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
stressful this point we call it do 14 is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
stressful this point we call it do 14 is
actually<00:01:36.750> excellent<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.409> releasing<00:01:37.770> some

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
actually excellent for releasing some

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460 
actually excellent for releasing some
heat<00:01:38.250> which<00:01:38.549> because<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.000> did<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.290> bit

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
heat which because I did do a little bit

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.850 
heat which because I did do a little bit
of<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:40.650> intake<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.159> him<00:01:41.340> beforehand<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.540> see

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
of an intake with him beforehand to see

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
of an intake with him beforehand to see
kind<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> diagnostically<00:01:44.700> what<00:01:44.970> kinds<00:01:45.299> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
kind of diagnostically what kinds of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
kind of diagnostically what kinds of
issues<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.780> needed<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> work<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.040> him<00:01:47.220> so

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
issues I needed to work with for him so

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
issues I needed to work with for him so
once<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.479> needles<00:01:48.930> inserted<00:01:49.259> we're

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
once we get these needles inserted we're

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.740 
once we get these needles inserted we're
going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> let<00:01:50.189> them<00:01:50.310> rest<00:01:50.520> quietly<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.479> for

about 20 minutes to let them get the
energy<00:01:54.570> moving<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> help<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
energy moving and help with the
