00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.320
 servus here is the favorite battery i 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.760
 I discovered somewhere in the recipe 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 do not even know who it is 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.330
 frankly, it's called pancake 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.650
 this person also wrote here 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.930
 I do not know if it's the recipe 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.730
 There was a normal recipe from the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.890
 internet which I then on the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.579
 thermal written but not 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.500
 changed rowling with banana like that 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.660
 it's done well I'll do it 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.239
 The oven pancake is really very 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.300
 of course, even if you do not have it 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.050
 fry from the pan but in the oven 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:56.739
 is it fun to make you fat again ? 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:01:03.780
 starting with 600 milliliters of milk 250 g 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.780
 flour 2 eggs 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:33.180
 Something salt I make larger 1 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.539
 tablespoons butter soft from outside pure 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.539
 want 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 a tablespoon of sugar 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:02.460

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:08.459

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.610
 The following is my mother's help 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.720
 I just got up to level 7 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.640
 put here a baking tray 1 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.090
 high ranked 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.290
 I put the baking paper in there 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.670
 then I'll save myself again 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.380
 So I'm not here on the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:38.299
 austerity just so I have to 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.299
 mostly do not say decapitate and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.870

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.170
 220 degrees 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:57.480
 for 25 to 30 minutes 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 I have the upper bottom heat so finished 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.709
 it looks really great 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.769
 so that it stays up so high 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.150
 nothing sticks that is 1a 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:20.819
 I already have something with jam 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:23.310
 paint and now try one 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.790
 recipe is that was the classic 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.790
 with apple jam is definitely too 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.280

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.659
 Wanted bear jam We have it 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:48.519
 already covered with apple bananas or 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:53.569
 just apple sauce or chocolate cream like that 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:04:07.099

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:36.949
 remained 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:45.020

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:46.849
 Sugar what's in there is so great 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.560
