00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.030
 chip and me then 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.580
 yes it is a matter of waiting to see what level 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.650
 first you have to go so everything here 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.720
 adjust and scan a bit of a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.690
 we look at what they say 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.459
 and if she just keeps on going 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.900
 we are doing is just that 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.190
 very nice and then yes that sometimes gives 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.140
 completely sufficient 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.250
 how that here if you week with that group 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.220

 you just want to be a patient on the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.769
 training whole thing can do to make sure 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.720
 that you have to get out of the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.850
 must give everything will jeroen yes just 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.799
 that so good for their own development 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.140
 RAI FLAT proves with that development 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.690
 that psv has chosen the correct route 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.980
 with regard to own youth 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.190
 we all know which way bv's 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.480
 and everyone agrees 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.799
 busy you also notice that within the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.630
 club that everyone you that watching 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.820
 the same way and you notice that and the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.170
 taste you and also assume that we are mutual 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.269
 also have one about that there hunt there 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.829

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.470
 hms away and you keep developing green 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.450
 and you prove it and a bit for it 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.070
 natural chance can come in the dat 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.780
 that we can be the pub finger 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.760
 because they want 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.040
 yes fine for us if this is j player 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.660
 actually a first stop now and yes 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.489
 also a moment where you can let it go 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.590
 see what your qualities are 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.880
 way to work and yes you can too 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.280
 Do as a person to see how you do 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.859
 and that is training camp 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.919
 actually an ultimate moment for that 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.150
 and when did it pass you as 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.949
 I'll know soon board a plane 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.920
 and I know I could then have everything 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.560
 done and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
 that there are no regrets or things so that i 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.799
 just everything everywhere beneath percent 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.280
 specified, and all constructed from and then 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.280
