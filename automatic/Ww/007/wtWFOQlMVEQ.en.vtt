to<00:01:55.759> navigate<00:01:56.149> around<00:01:56.270> these<00:01:56.539> doors<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.349> so

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
to navigate around these doors so we so

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.679 
to navigate around these doors so we so
we<00:01:57.860> designed<00:01:58.189> them<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.369> be<00:01:58.579> pocket<00:01:59.000> doors<00:01:59.209> so

remote control shower so Tyler can come
in<00:05:47.430> here<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.640> he<00:05:47.820> can<00:05:48.000> pre-program<00:05:48.420> is<00:05:48.960> his

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
in here and he can pre-program is his

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.920 
in here and he can pre-program is his
handheld<00:05:50.040> for<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.760> exact<00:05:51.090> temperature<00:05:51.600> and

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
handheld for the exact temperature and

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.990 
handheld for the exact temperature and
flow<00:05:52.200> rate<00:05:52.530> so<00:05:53.010> every<00:05:53.190> time<00:05:53.340> tire<00:05:53.580> takes<00:05:53.910> a

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
flow rate so every time tire takes a

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.510 
flow rate so every time tire takes a
shower<00:05:54.740> all<00:05:55.740> he<00:05:55.830> has<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:55.950> do<00:05:56.100> is<00:05:56.190> hit<00:05:56.310> one

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
shower all he has to do is hit one

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.860 
shower all he has to do is hit one
button<00:05:56.700> and<00:05:57.000> it's<00:05:57.300> going<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.480> come<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.780> the

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
button and it's going to come to the

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.750 
button and it's going to come to the
same<00:05:58.050> temperature<00:05:58.350> same<00:05:58.980> flow<00:05:59.250> rate<00:05:59.280> as<00:05:59.640> the

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
same temperature same flow rate as the

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.730 
same temperature same flow rate as the
day<00:05:59.910> before<00:06:00.090> so<00:06:00.600> entire<00:06:00.840> gets<00:06:01.470> up<00:06:01.590> in<00:06:01.710> the

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
day before so entire gets up in the

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.680 
day before so entire gets up in the
middle<00:06:01.890> and<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.130> let's<00:06:02.460> say<00:06:02.640> between<00:06:02.850> 12<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:03.420> 6

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.960 
middle and I let's say between 12 and 6
it'll<00:06:03.990> bring<00:06:04.110> these<00:06:04.320> lights<00:06:04.560> on<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:05.220> 15

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
it'll bring these lights on to 15

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.210 
it'll bring these lights on to 15
percent<00:06:06.390> of<00:06:06.450> their<00:06:06.660> other<00:06:07.020> maximum<00:06:07.500> so<00:06:08.100> they

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
percent of their other maximum so they

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.310 
percent of their other maximum so they
don't<00:06:08.370> come<00:06:08.520> on<00:06:08.580> full<00:06:09.060> blast<00:06:09.210> in<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.720> in<00:06:10.170> the
