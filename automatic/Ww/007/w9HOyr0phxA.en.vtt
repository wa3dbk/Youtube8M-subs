you facing and why we made all those
variables<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.430> pin<00:00:20.670> step<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.890> okay

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
variables in the pin step one okay

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.560 
variables in the pin step one okay
you'll<00:00:23.039> notice<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.490> i<00:00:23.699> got<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.029> talent

the<00:01:40.170> 2d<00:01:40.740> sprite<00:01:41.009> tutorial<00:01:41.549> you'll<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:42.000> why<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the 2d sprite tutorial you'll know why I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
the 2d sprite tutorial you'll know why I
made<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.659> walk<00:01:42.960> Brock<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:44.310> errand<00:01:44.670> down

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
made this walk Brock and my errand down

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
made this walk Brock and my errand down
while<00:01:45.840> Aaron<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.350> controls<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
while Aaron down controls all the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190 
while Aaron down controls all the
variables<00:01:47.430> walk<00:01:48.210> block<00:01:48.509> controls<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
variables walk block controls all the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.940 
variables walk block controls all the
collisions<00:01:49.860> makes<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.240> stuck

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
collisions makes it so I don't get stuck

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.179 
collisions makes it so I don't get stuck
all<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> collisions<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:53.970> basically<00:01:54.420> bounce

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
all the collisions are basically bounce

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
all the collisions are basically bounce
but<00:01:56.189> under<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> mushroom<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.689> bit

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
but under the mushroom it's a little bit

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.340 
but under the mushroom it's a little bit
different<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.460> I'll<00:01:59.610> show<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.880> why<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
different and I'll show you why if the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.670 
different and I'll show you why if the
hip<00:02:01.590> points<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.399> mushroom<00:02:03.140> see<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hip points of the mushroom see other is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.459 
hip points of the mushroom see other is
lower<00:02:05.369> than<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> equal<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.479> hundred<00:02:06.600> sorry<00:02:07.079> all

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
lower than is equal to hundred sorry all

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
lower than is equal to hundred sorry all
bounce<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.250> just<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.759> anything<00:02:09.090> else<00:02:09.330> but

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
bounce off just like anything else but

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.580 
bounce off just like anything else but
if<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.379> smaller<00:02:11.030> then

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
if it is smaller then

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.059 
if it is smaller then
i<00:02:12.650> bounce<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.730> differently<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.920> one

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
i bounce a little differently for one

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.710 
i bounce a little differently for one
thing<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:16.459> have<00:02:16.640> more<00:02:16.849> than<00:02:16.910> one<00:02:17.060> creature<00:02:17.450> on

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
thing you have more than one creature on

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.119 
thing you have more than one creature on
the<00:02:17.840> screen<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.410> how<00:02:18.680> do<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.920> bounce

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
the screen so how do you bounce

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.250 
the screen so how do you bounce
appropriately<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:20.450> each<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.170> these

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
appropriately off each of these

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.990 
appropriately off each of these
creatures<00:02:21.530> especially<00:02:22.370> when<00:02:22.849> they're

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
creatures especially when they're

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.490 
creatures especially when they're
attacking<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.870> coming<00:02:24.110> at<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:24.470> a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
attacking you and coming at you a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.550 
attacking you and coming at you a
certain<00:02:24.560> direction<00:02:24.980> or<00:02:25.569> pushing<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
certain direction or pushing you so if I

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.199 
certain direction or pushing you so if I
stood<00:02:27.860> still<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> mushroom<00:02:28.670> whichever<00:02:29.030> way

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
stood still the mushroom whichever way

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.410 
stood still the mushroom whichever way
he<00:02:29.239> was<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.750> would<00:02:30.470> push<00:02:30.709> me<00:02:30.950> around<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.390> I

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
he was going would push me around so I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.680 
he was going would push me around so I
point<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.920> cook<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.549> instance<00:02:35.120> nearest

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
point to the cook the instance nearest

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.589 
point to the cook the instance nearest
the<00:02:35.900> mushroom<00:02:36.290> which<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.620> closest<00:02:37.129> I<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:38.030> set

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
the mushroom which is closest I I set

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.930 
the mushroom which is closest I I set
that<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:38.989> variable<00:02:39.290> called<00:02:39.590> facing<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.430> I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
that to a variable called facing and I

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.520 
that to a variable called facing and I
are<00:02:41.860> pointer<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.250> face<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:44.090> direction

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
are pointer and I face the direction

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.870 
are pointer and I face the direction
sorry<00:02:45.530> point<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.069> me<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> variable<00:02:46.579> I'm

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
sorry point to me as the variable I'm

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.809 
sorry point to me as the variable I'm
making<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.450> face<00:02:47.690> towards<00:02:48.140> point<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> me

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
making and I face towards point to me

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.339 
making and I face towards point to me
therefore<00:02:49.819> I'm<00:02:49.910> facing<00:02:50.150> towards<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.840> closest

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
therefore I'm facing towards the closest

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.589 
therefore I'm facing towards the closest
mushroom<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.400> my<00:02:53.090> speed<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:54.549> set<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.849> where<00:02:56.480> I'm

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
mushroom in my speed is set to where I'm

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.229 
mushroom in my speed is set to where I'm
facing<00:02:56.840> always<00:02:57.440> at<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.370> negative<00:02:58.790> five<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.150> i'm

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
facing always at a negative five so i'm

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.789 
facing always at a negative five so i'm
actually<00:02:59.450> not<00:02:59.690> bouncing<00:03:00.260> up<00:03:00.349> just<00:03:00.560> kind<00:03:00.709> of

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
actually not bouncing up just kind of

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.130 
actually not bouncing up just kind of
reversing<00:03:01.340> directions<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.720> needed

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
reversing directions and that's needed

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.979 
reversing directions and that's needed
so<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.349> don't<00:03:03.590> bounce<00:03:03.799> weird<00:03:04.519> directions<00:03:05.209> say

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
so you don't bounce weird directions say

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.170 
so you don't bounce weird directions say
there's<00:03:06.260> one<00:03:06.769> injured<00:03:07.370> mushroom<00:03:07.849> out<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.090> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
there's one injured mushroom out of the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.699 
there's one injured mushroom out of the
hundred<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.660> are<00:03:08.810> there<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.140> all<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.650> a

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
hundred that are there and all of a

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:10.839 
hundred that are there and all of a
sudden<00:03:09.739> you're<00:03:10.099> bouncing<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.670> weird

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
sudden you're bouncing this weird

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.619 
sudden you're bouncing this weird
direction<00:03:11.000> because<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.410> one<00:03:12.560> mushroom

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
direction because of that one mushroom

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.390 
direction because of that one mushroom
okay<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:14.690> let's<00:03:15.079> go<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.260> attack<00:03:15.680> which<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.040> also

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
okay so let's go to attack which is also

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.940 
okay so let's go to attack which is also
controlled<00:03:16.730> here<00:03:17.120> or<00:03:17.269> forgot<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.410> mention<00:03:18.769> you

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
controlled here or forgot to mention you

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.759 
controlled here or forgot to mention you

any<00:03:41.209> USB<00:03:41.569> controller<00:03:42.079> should<00:03:42.139> work<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:43.459> one

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
any USB controller should work this one

any USB controller should work this one
is<00:03:43.819> my<00:03:43.970> sword<00:03:44.859> basically<00:03:45.859> i<00:03:45.889> have<00:03:46.370> i<00:03:46.579> have

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
is my sword basically i have i have

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.330 
is my sword basically i have i have
controlling<00:03:47.329> variables<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.739> controls<00:03:49.160> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
controlling variables this controls the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.240 
controlling variables this controls the
sound<00:03:49.700> so<00:03:50.239> ignore<00:03:50.599> that<00:03:50.780> part<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.260> i<00:03:51.919> create

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
sound so ignore that part and i create

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.270 
sound so ignore that part and i create
an<00:03:52.370> instance<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.970> my<00:03:53.180> sword<00:03:53.540> kind<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.650> offset

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
an instance of my sword kind of offset

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.580 
an instance of my sword kind of offset
from<00:03:55.579> where<00:03:55.880> i'm<00:03:56.000> facing<00:03:56.510> in<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:57.230> animation

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
from where i'm facing in the animation

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.420 
from where i'm facing in the animation
plays<00:03:58.040> which<00:03:58.400> gets<00:03:58.669> the<00:03:58.880> slicing<00:03:59.480> animation

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
plays which gets the slicing animation

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.150 
plays which gets the slicing animation
but<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.549> only<00:04:01.730> works<00:04:02.000> if<00:04:02.239> i<00:04:02.389> have<00:04:02.599> stamina

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
but this only works if i have stamina

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.830 
but this only works if i have stamina
remember<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.310> created<00:04:04.790> under<00:04:05.000> air<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.599> down

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
remember we created under air and down

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.330 
remember we created under air and down
we<00:04:06.319> created<00:04:06.769> stamina<00:04:07.250> there's<00:04:08.180> an<00:04:08.389> alarm<00:04:09.340> now

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
we created stamina there's an alarm now

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.159 
we created stamina there's an alarm now
magic<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> little<00:04:11.480> bit<00:04:11.630> different<00:04:11.959> here's

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
magic is a little bit different here's

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.190 
magic is a little bit different here's
my<00:04:12.319> shield<00:04:12.650> if<00:04:12.919> i<00:04:13.669> have<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.940> shield<00:04:14.359> meaning<00:04:15.049> i

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
my shield if i have a shield meaning i

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.250 
my shield if i have a shield meaning i

picked one up sometime then i'll show a

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.909 
picked one up sometime then i'll show a
shield<00:04:19.510> now<00:04:20.510> here's<00:04:20.810> talent<00:04:21.229> if<00:04:21.289> my<00:04:21.469> talent<00:04:21.890> is

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
shield now here's talent if my talent is

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.190 
shield now here's talent if my talent is
equal<00:04:22.219> to<00:04:22.370> one<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.909> controls<00:04:23.270> my<00:04:23.360> fireball<00:04:24.020> if

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
equal to one it controls my fireball if

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.530 
equal to one it controls my fireball if
my<00:04:24.950> talent<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.520> equal<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.940> two

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
my talent is equal to two

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.020 
my talent is equal to two
my<00:04:26.840> lightning<00:04:27.260> for<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.070> fireball<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.790> pretty

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
my lightning for a fireball is pretty

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.140 
my lightning for a fireball is pretty
simple<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.660> have<00:04:30.560> timers<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.370> can<00:04:31.580> that

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
simple I have timers that can that

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.000 
simple I have timers that can that
control<00:04:32.570> how<00:04:32.720> fast<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.200> shoot<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.590> fireball

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
control how fast I shoot the fireball

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.310 
control how fast I shoot the fireball
and<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:34.610> have<00:04:34.790> talent<00:04:35.240> points<00:04:35.450> which<00:04:35.900> control

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
and I have talent points which control

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.520 
and I have talent points which control
my<00:04:36.470> mana<00:04:37.180> but<00:04:38.180> basically<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.810> just<00:04:39.140> throw<00:04:39.500> a

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
my mana but basically I just throw a

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.270 
my mana but basically I just throw a
fireball<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.590> goes<00:04:42.770> off<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.980> certain

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
fireball and and it goes off a certain

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.830 
fireball and and it goes off a certain
direction<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:43.970> with<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.360> with<00:04:44.630> the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
direction but with the with the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.920 
direction but with the with the
lightning<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:46.330> create<00:04:47.330> instead<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.690> creating

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
lightning I create instead of creating

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.680 
lightning I create instead of creating
lightning<00:04:48.320> I<00:04:48.560> create<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:48.920> crosshair<00:04:49.690> right

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
lightning I create a crosshair right

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.120 
lightning I create a crosshair right
here<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.740> crosshair<00:04:52.750> takes<00:04:53.750> over<00:04:54.140> control

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
here this crosshair takes over control

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.570 
here this crosshair takes over control
so<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.550> no<00:04:55.880> longer<00:04:56.180> move<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:57.220> when<00:04:58.220> it's<00:04:58.400> in

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
so I can no longer move and when it's in

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.340 
so I can no longer move and when it's in
existence<00:04:59.180> my<00:04:59.360> character<00:04:59.810> can<00:04:59.990> no<00:05:00.080> longer

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
existence my character can no longer

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.380 
existence my character can no longer
move<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.950> then<00:05:01.670> when<00:05:01.940> I<00:05:01.970> hit<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.360> button

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
move and then when I hit the button

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.810 
move and then when I hit the button
again<00:05:02.720> wherever<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.830> light<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.280> Cross<00:05:04.610> or

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
again wherever the light of the Cross or

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.180 
again wherever the light of the Cross or
maybe<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.450> creates<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.050> lightning<00:05:06.410> spell<00:05:06.710> and

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
maybe it creates the lightning spell and

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.860 
maybe it creates the lightning spell and
again<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.180> use<00:05:08.390> a<00:05:08.420> trigger<00:05:08.810> here<00:05:09.170> wait<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.280> start

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
again I use a trigger here wait to start

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.600 
again I use a trigger here wait to start
connected<00:05:11.870> with<00:05:12.020> an<00:05:12.140> alarm<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.710> control<00:05:13.460> the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
connected with an alarm to control the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.850 
connected with an alarm to control the
speed<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.090> lightning<00:05:14.510> now<00:05:15.200> unless<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:15.680> do

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
speed of the lightning now unless you do

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.650 
speed of the lightning now unless you do
this<00:05:15.980> you<00:05:16.190> might<00:05:16.370> shoot<00:05:16.640> off<00:05:16.820> like<00:05:17.060> 20

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
this you might shoot off like 20

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.900 
this you might shoot off like 20
different<00:05:17.810> lightnings<00:05:18.440> when<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.400> hit<00:05:19.730> that

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
different lightnings when you hit that

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.790 
different lightnings when you hit that
button<00:05:20.020> because<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.140> computer<00:05:21.590> makes

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
button because the computer makes

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.130 
button because the computer makes
millions<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.760> calculations<00:05:22.970> at<00:05:23.600> once<00:05:23.840> it

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
millions of calculations at once it

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.200 
millions of calculations at once it
needs<00:05:24.470> timing<00:05:25.160> to<00:05:25.460> be<00:05:25.580> able<00:05:25.670> to<00:05:25.850> work<00:05:25.940> properly

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
needs timing to be able to work properly

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.010 
needs timing to be able to work properly
and<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:27.500> is<00:05:27.740> how<00:05:27.890> you<00:05:27.950> get<00:05:28.280> your<00:05:28.340> control<00:05:28.670> a

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
and that is how you get your control a

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.870 
and that is how you get your control a
general<00:05:30.020> way<00:05:30.200> showing<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.340> how<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.520> get<00:05:31.850> your
