00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 Well, no we are doing everything we can 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.909
 to try to 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.349
 to present wines 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.789
 % dough and our personal touch will be the hottest 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.060
 the obvious been the most 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 relevant 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 I can say that in 2009% for a very long time well 100% of the vineyard 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.530
 and as long as the cure 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.570
 this is a first step it is a first point we grant to the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.570
 also a lot of importance 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.200
 plot selection 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.330
 allah the maturity 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.450
 grapes and in particular glutinous tannins 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.420
 why because% when you have the chance to work in saint-estÃ¨ve and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.380
 in bronze especially well 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.080
 the product of wines that naturally are of great richness a wealth 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.100
 panic a wealth 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.470
 aromatic 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.750
 and today the little more we are trying to bring 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.400
 at 16 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.030
 who enjoys an outstanding reputation lugar at work who has 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 been done by our predecessors well it's precisely this balance 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469
 between them the power 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.429
 the richness of the wind but they can also well the finesse of the tannins 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.420
 the appearance and wishes island almost granules of tannins 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.259
 and we are very attached to that work that we had% started in 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.580
 2007 we have continued on 2008 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.610
 which is extremely promising created and who today% is a real he 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 we like a lot 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.870
 well we tried to transcribe it and improve it further in 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870
 2009 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.840
 mini nature offered us a vintage 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.980
 exceptional 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.990
 ongoing in 2009 it differs from 2007 and 2008 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.190
 well maybe 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.600
 announces that the two phases 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.800
 2 for 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.879
 of the vegetative cycle 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.989
 have occurred under optimum conditions 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.940
 % in terms of climatology 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 I am talking about the flowering of the house 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.030
 in German eg of veraison 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.599
 without speaking 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.629
 a few weeks before the harvest 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.340
 which have all unfolded in a situation in optimum soleiman 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.409
 maybe even epidemic deficit 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.439
 so of drought 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.349
 ap all the interest of being able to rely on a terroir like the one morose% dow 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.119
 jones said that he is constituted afp speaking of the soil he is 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.370
 consisting of big fat sure a good fifty meters thick and 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.219
 which applies it rests on a base 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.509
 money from work 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.179
 % well water throat fabric 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.239
 during winter and spring and so that diffuses 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.929
 as a road cutter 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.559
 and say that water 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.219
 throughout the year 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.749
 what 2009 that few we realized that is today 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.209
 assembled because the mold we chose this policy of an assembly 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.229
 precocious 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.089
 well for 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.160
 they delighted us 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.449
 we have as a technician 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.569
 well the presence we are in the presence 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.370
 an exceptional vintage 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.840
 of euros we must try to remember 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.760
 % 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.689
 bumper 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.879
 only since the month of September and the beginning of a unification 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.489
 and during its breeding we have the awareness that we have to combine 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.159
 zine that one may have the chance to produce one or two times throughout the 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.349
 ship of a quarry 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.869
 so you have to know how to be 13 tables compared to what nature we are going 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:45.399
 to do and 2009 is one of those great vintages some speak% in term 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.909
 comparison and well from 1989 to see 1961 is to say the potential that there is 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.419
 in this wine which man percent at the castle rose mount and now 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.729
 meeting definitively since December 2009 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.459
 all three barrels since January 2010 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.029
 awesome 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.709
 minimal feminine
