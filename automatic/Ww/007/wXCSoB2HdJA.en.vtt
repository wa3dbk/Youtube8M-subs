this<00:02:13.520> battle<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.050> pretty<00:02:15.320> close<00:02:15.709> battle

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
this battle it was a pretty close battle

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.310 
this battle it was a pretty close battle
but<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> think<00:02:16.880> Archie<00:02:17.209> Griffin<00:02:17.540> had<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.110> most

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
but I think Archie Griffin had the most

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.250 
but I think Archie Griffin had the most
epic<00:02:18.530> wins<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.520> all<00:02:19.790> those<00:02:20.110> stadium<00:02:21.110> outs

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
epic wins with all those stadium outs

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.500 
epic wins with all those stadium outs

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
even though this is a completely walled
