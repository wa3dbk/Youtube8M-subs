00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:15.340
 all our meetings separation 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.340
 dried 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.240
 you are sad weapon amber pine 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:37.330
 ashless smudged ashes 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:40.870
 embers of the campfire 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.870
 it's time to leave 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.010
 my dearest

 sun forest 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:01:00.970
 by which edges you will meet with me 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.970
 my dear 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.710

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.930
 wings piled up tents 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 their flight is over 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.710
 this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.520
 the wings spread their parting seekers 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.520
 aircraft 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.270
 and quietly backtrack moves away from the wing 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 here really is the gap between us 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.289
 lay down 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 My dear sun forest 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:59.250
 where in what lands will you meet me 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 my dearest 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:10.360
 sun forest 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:11.680
 where in what region will you meet me not 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.560
 I don't need their words
