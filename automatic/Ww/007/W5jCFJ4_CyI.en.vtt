00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
starts one of the things that people

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
starts one of the things that people
need<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.720> right<00:00:31.140> off<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> bat<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:31.949> they

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
need to know right off the bat when they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.340 
need to know right off the bat when they
want<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> roast<00:00:32.430> their<00:00:32.610> vegetables<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.200> me

want to roast their vegetables so for me

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.479 
want to roast their vegetables so for me
I<00:00:35.219> look<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.030> roasting<00:00:36.329> vegetables

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
I look at roasting vegetables

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.470 
I look at roasting vegetables
individually<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.850> depends<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
individually so it depends on the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
individually so it depends on the
vegetable<00:00:40.170> itself<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:41.030> I'll<00:00:42.030> give<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
vegetable itself and then I'll give you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.910 
vegetable itself and then I'll give you
an<00:00:42.420> example<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> sweet<00:00:43.500> potatoes

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
an example here with the sweet potatoes

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740 
an example here with the sweet potatoes
I<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.579> take<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
I actually take this through a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
I actually take this through a
three-step<00:00:46.559> process<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.820> first<00:00:48.059> step<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
three-step process the first step is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.979 
three-step process the first step is
setting<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> oven<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.590> 350<00:00:50.160> degrees<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
setting the oven at 350 degrees and

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
setting the oven at 350 degrees and
putting<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> potatoes<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.920> whole<00:00:53.219> without

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
putting the potatoes in whole without

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.080 
putting the potatoes in whole without
any<00:00:54.860> olive<00:00:55.860> oil<00:00:56.010> rubbed<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.879> no

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
any olive oil rubbed on them with no

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.740 
any olive oil rubbed on them with no
salt<00:00:57.449> nothing<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.890> whole<00:00:59.250> potatoes<00:00:59.879> placed

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
salt nothing just whole potatoes placed

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
salt nothing just whole potatoes placed
into<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> oven<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.410> 350<00:01:02.129> degrees<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.640> do

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
into the oven at 350 degrees and I do

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.600 
into the oven at 350 degrees and I do
that<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.359> half<00:01:03.570> hour<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.430> take<00:01:05.430> them

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that for the first half hour I take them

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
that for the first half hour I take them
out<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.180> cool<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.630> down<00:01:06.770> during<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
out and I cool them down during that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
out and I cool them down during that
cooling<00:01:08.460> process<00:01:08.700> they're<00:01:09.240> still<00:01:09.540> going

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
cooling process they're still going

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.520 
cooling process they're still going
through<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:11.119> cooking<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.990> still<00:01:13.229> hot

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
through a cooking because it's still hot

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.560 
through a cooking because it's still hot
inside<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.850> still<00:01:15.030> continuing

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
inside right so it's still continuing

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
inside right so it's still continuing
the<00:01:15.659> cook<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> gets<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.979> perfect

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the cook but it gets to that perfect

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.810 
the cook but it gets to that perfect
center<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.770> point<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.250> cut<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.790> half

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
center at that point I cut them in half

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.090 
center at that point I cut them in half
and<00:01:21.560> then<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.619> turned<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.100> oven<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.960> about

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
and then I turned my oven up to about

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.490 
and then I turned my oven up to about
525<00:01:26.100> 550<00:01:27.090> degrees<00:01:27.509> however<00:01:27.750> hot<00:01:27.960> i<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
525 550 degrees however hot i can get it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.160 
525 550 degrees however hot i can get it
yeah<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.700> placed<00:01:30.000> those<00:01:30.180> potatoes<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
yeah and i placed those potatoes in the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.010 
yeah and i placed those potatoes in the
oven<00:01:31.640> open-faced<00:01:32.640> once<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.420> nothing<00:01:34.200> on

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
oven open-faced once again nothing on

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.039 
oven open-faced once again nothing on
and<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.829> roast<00:01:36.130> them<00:01:36.369> when<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.390> natural<00:01:37.780> sugars

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
and I roast them when the natural sugars

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.870 
and I roast them when the natural sugars
start<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.619> develop<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.219> can<00:01:39.340> see<00:01:39.549> this<00:01:39.700> in

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
start to develop and you can see this in

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.370 
start to develop and you can see this in
here<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.179> you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.329> even<00:01:40.450> hear<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.049> crackling

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
here and you can even hear the crackling

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.709 
here and you can even hear the crackling
right<00:01:41.799> when<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.609> natural<00:01:43.000> sugars<00:01:43.179> start<00:01:43.600> to

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
right when the natural sugars start to

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.800 
right when the natural sugars start to
develop<00:01:43.869> it's<00:01:44.619> going<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.920> start<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.189> darken

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
develop it's going to start to darken

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.559 
develop it's going to start to darken
okay<00:01:46.810> at<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.590> point<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.759> sweet<00:01:49.030> potato<00:01:49.329> is

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
okay at that point this sweet potato is

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.340 
okay at that point this sweet potato is
at<00:01:49.840> its<00:01:50.549> optimum<00:01:51.549> point<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.270> sweetness<00:01:52.689> I<00:01:52.899> take

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
at its optimum point of sweetness I take

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.020 
at its optimum point of sweetness I take
them<00:01:53.500> out<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> oven<00:01:53.860> all<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.490> do<00:01:54.729> in<00:01:55.000> this

bit<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.329> olive<00:02:01.929> what<00:02:02.590> that's<00:02:03.399> all<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.729> do<00:02:04.149> hear

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
bit of olive what that's all I do hear

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.359 
bit of olive what that's all I do hear
that<00:02:04.630> kind<00:02:05.079> of<00:02:05.110> goes<00:02:05.289> against<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.920> think<00:02:06.100> all

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
that kind of goes against I think all

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.979 
that kind of goes against I think all
when<00:02:06.789> you're<00:02:06.969> saying<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.630> everybody's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
when you're saying that and everybody's

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.380 
when you're saying that and everybody's
sitting<00:02:08.110> at<00:02:08.319> home<00:02:08.470> going<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:10.239> of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
sitting at home going like because of

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.089 
sitting at home going like because of
course<00:02:10.569> we<00:02:10.630> think<00:02:10.959> of<00:02:11.079> like<00:02:11.230> okay<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.890> get

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
course we think of like okay you get

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.800 
course we think of like okay you get
them<00:02:12.250> ready<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.970> know<00:02:13.090> oil<00:02:13.360> then<00:02:13.599> you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
them ready you you know oil then you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.870 
them ready you you know oil then you
salt<00:02:14.110> them<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.440> mean<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.130> important<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> kind

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
salt them I mean is it important to kind

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.250 
salt them I mean is it important to kind
of<00:02:16.000> take<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.209> step<00:02:16.269> back<00:02:16.630> with<00:02:16.840> each<00:02:16.989> vegetable

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
of take a step back with each vegetable

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.530 
of take a step back with each vegetable
and<00:02:17.769> take<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> look<00:02:18.099> at<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.459> analyze<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:19.209> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and take a look at it and analyze it you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.390 
and take a look at it and analyze it you
know<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.780> really<00:02:20.349> pinpoint<00:02:21.099> what's<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.299> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
know and really pinpoint what's going to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.339 
know and really pinpoint what's going to
optimize<00:02:24.400> when<00:02:25.360> there's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.690> vegetable<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.319> a

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
optimize when there's a vegetable with a

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.350 
optimize when there's a vegetable with a
skin<00:02:26.799> is<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.250> important<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.730> kind<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
skin is it important to kind of get that

skin is it important to kind of get that
initial<00:02:28.750> cooking<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.920> then<00:02:30.190> turn<00:02:30.400> the

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
initial cooking and then turn the

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.539 
initial cooking and then turn the
temperature<00:02:30.760> up<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.769> depends<00:02:33.190> on

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
temperature up you know it depends on

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.640 
temperature up you know it depends on
the<00:02:33.610> thickness<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.900> girth<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.410> size

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the thickness and on the girth the size

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.920 
the thickness and on the girth the size
of<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.160> vegetable<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.660> vegetable

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
of the vegetable if you have a vegetable

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.710 
of the vegetable if you have a vegetable
that<00:02:38.349> ultimately<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.639> big<00:02:40.030> fat<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.450> around

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
that ultimately is is big fat and around

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.259 
that ultimately is is big fat and around
the<00:02:41.170> higher<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.650> heat<00:02:41.889> and<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.670> quicker<00:02:43.030> it's

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
the higher the heat and the quicker it's

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.449 
the higher the heat and the quicker it's
going<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.660> burn<00:02:43.840> right<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.709> course<00:02:44.829> okay<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
going to burn right of course okay and

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.789 
going to burn right of course okay and
the<00:02:45.639> less<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.120> going<00:02:46.389> to<00:02:46.480> cook<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.500> may

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
the less it's going to cook so you may

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.009 
the less it's going to cook so you may
need<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.160> do<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.639> two<00:02:49.000> stage<00:02:49.269> or<00:02:49.569> three<00:02:49.780> stage

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
need to do a two stage or three stage

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.559 
need to do a two stage or three stage
method<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.829> just<00:02:51.040> described<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.790> order<00:02:52.450> to

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
method like I just described in order to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.000 
method like I just described in order to
get<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.019> point<00:02:53.230> where<00:02:53.440> it's<00:02:53.590> perfect

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
get it to the point where it's perfect

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.680 
get it to the point where it's perfect
inside<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.459> then<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.420> get<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
inside and then you get the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.780 
inside and then you get the
carmelization<00:02:56.109> centered<00:02:56.829> afterwards<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.430> do

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
carmelization centered afterwards I do

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.479 
carmelization centered afterwards I do
the<00:02:58.090> same<00:02:58.299> thing<00:02:58.540> with<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.810> acorn<00:02:59.260> squash<00:02:59.489> so

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the same thing with this acorn squash so

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.569 
the same thing with this acorn squash so
I<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.720> acorn<00:03:02.109> squash<00:03:02.170> any<00:03:02.590> or<00:03:02.859> butternut<00:03:03.370> or

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
I the acorn squash any or butternut or

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.699 
I the acorn squash any or butternut or
or<00:03:03.790> any<00:03:04.060> squash<00:03:04.389> like<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.170> cut<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
or any squash like that like I cut the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.009 
or any squash like that like I cut the
squash<00:03:06.310> in<00:03:06.849> this<00:03:07.090> case<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.480> sprinkle<00:03:07.959> a

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
squash in this case I just sprinkle a

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.050 
squash in this case I just sprinkle a
little<00:03:08.170> salt<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.620> pepper<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:09.040> because<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
little salt and pepper on because the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.520 
little salt and pepper on because the
squash<00:03:10.329> has<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.569> different<00:03:10.930> kind<00:03:11.079> of<00:03:11.200> texture

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
squash has a different kind of texture

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.699 
squash has a different kind of texture
then<00:03:12.459> sweet<00:03:12.700> potato<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.269> little<00:03:13.510> bit

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
then sweet potato it's a little bit

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.490 
then sweet potato it's a little bit
firmer<00:03:14.709> okay<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.180> want<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.569> get<00:03:17.079> some<00:03:17.260> water

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
firmer okay so I want to get some water

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.080 
firmer okay so I want to get some water
out<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.980> squash<00:03:18.220> there's<00:03:18.430> Ohio<00:03:18.730> water

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
out of the squash there's Ohio water

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.120 
out of the squash there's Ohio water
content<00:03:19.690> there<00:03:20.079> so<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.680> want<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.889> get<00:03:20.980> some

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
content there so I want to get some

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.559 
content there so I want to get some
water<00:03:21.310> out<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.730> squash<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.269> I'm<00:03:22.359> using

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
water out of the squash so I'm using

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.699 
water out of the squash so I'm using
some<00:03:22.870> salt<00:03:23.169> and<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:24.370> roast<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:25.440> once<00:03:26.440> again<00:03:26.680> I

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
some salt and I roast it once again I

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.190 
some salt and I roast it once again I
bake<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.549> let<00:03:27.760> me<00:03:27.849> rephrase<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.510> fake<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.840> at

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
bake it let me rephrase I fake it at

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.700 
bake it let me rephrase I fake it at
about<00:03:29.319> two

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
about two

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.570 
about two
degrees<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> half<00:03:31.930> an<00:03:32.050> hour<00:03:32.250> after<00:03:33.250> which

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
degrees for a half an hour after which

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.760 
degrees for a half an hour after which
time<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.880> added<00:03:34.360> touch<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.600> honey<00:03:34.930> because

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
time I added touch of honey because

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.710 
time I added touch of honey because
squash<00:03:36.280> has<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> lower<00:03:36.850> residual<00:03:37.480> sugar

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
squash has a lower residual sugar

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.770 
squash has a lower residual sugar
content<00:03:37.990> then<00:03:38.920> sweet<00:03:39.910> potatoes<00:03:40.270> does<00:03:40.480> right

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
content then sweet potatoes does right

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.620 
content then sweet potatoes does right
so<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.380> needs<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:41.800> help<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.120> add<00:03:43.390> some

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
so it needs a little help so I add some

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.950 
so it needs a little help so I add some
honey<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.050> I<00:03:44.770> roast<00:03:45.070> it<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.430> oven<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:46.480> at

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
honey and I roast it in the oven and at

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.690 
honey and I roast it in the oven and at
that<00:03:46.990> point<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.680> takes<00:03:47.890> about<00:03:48.130> 8<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.670> 10

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
that point it takes about 8 to 10

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.640 
that point it takes about 8 to 10
minutes<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.420> it<00:03:49.600> only<00:03:49.780> takes<00:03:50.020> about<00:03:50.170> 8<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.590> 10

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
minutes and it only takes about 8 to 10

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.130 
minutes and it only takes about 8 to 10
minutes<00:03:50.770> on<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.850> finish<00:03:52.120> here<00:03:52.420> for<00:03:52.750> everyone

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
minutes on the finish here for everyone

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.630 
minutes on the finish here for everyone
who's<00:03:53.320> sitting<00:03:53.590> here<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.860> like<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.430> wait

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
who's sitting here going like but wait

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.430 
who's sitting here going like but wait
I've<00:03:54.880> been<00:03:55.030> told<00:03:55.180> my<00:03:55.330> whole<00:03:55.360> life<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:56.230> put

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
I've been told my whole life to put

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.380 
I've been told my whole life to put
olive<00:03:56.740> oil<00:03:56.950> on<00:03:57.190> everything<00:03:57.670> like<00:03:57.880> you're

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
olive oil on everything like you're

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.240 
olive oil on everything like you're
saying<00:03:58.630> stop<00:03:58.960> doing<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.440> what<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
saying stop doing that what is the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.450 
saying stop doing that what is the
advantage<00:04:00.490> of<00:04:00.790> not<00:04:01.000> having<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.450> oil<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:01.780> there

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
advantage of not having the oil on there

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.560 
advantage of not having the oil on there
in<00:04:03.460> this<00:04:03.670> case<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:05.910> don't<00:04:06.910> need<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.390> oil

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
in this case I don't need the oil

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.950 
in this case I don't need the oil
because<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.320> don't<00:04:08.980> need<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.460> pan-fry<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.660> I

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
because I don't need to pan-fry it I

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.180 
because I don't need to pan-fry it I
don't<00:04:11.140> need<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.350> do<00:04:11.620> any<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:12.010> those<00:04:12.130> things

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
don't need to do any of those things

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.660 
don't need to do any of those things
right<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.270> it<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.630> want<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.260> actually<00:04:14.610> cook<00:04:15.610> a

right to it I want to actually cook a

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.270 
right to it I want to actually cook a
taste<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.300> squash<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:17.200> want<00:04:17.800> to<00:04:17.890> taste<00:04:18.100> that

taste that squash I want to taste that

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.440 
taste that squash I want to taste that
sweet<00:04:18.580> potato<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.450> pure<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.910> its<00:04:22.120> purest

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
sweet potato and it's pure in its purest

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.100 
sweet potato and it's pure in its purest
form<00:04:23.490> in<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:24.730> case<00:04:25.000> I'm<00:04:25.330> adding<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.870> olive

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
form in this case I'm adding the olive

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.500 
form in this case I'm adding the olive
oil<00:04:26.290> after<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> fact<00:04:26.890> as<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.190> finishing<00:04:27.610> almost

oil after the fact as a finishing almost

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.970 
oil after the fact as a finishing almost
like<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.660> dressing<00:04:29.170> let's<00:04:29.650> talk<00:04:29.800> about

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
like a dressing let's talk about

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.340 
like a dressing let's talk about
vegetables<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.060> obviously<00:04:31.450> are<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.900> little

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
vegetables that obviously are a little

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.680 
vegetables that obviously are a little
bit<00:04:32.590> more<00:04:32.770> delicate<00:04:33.340> because<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.330> course<00:04:34.540> you

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
bit more delicate because of course you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.390 
bit more delicate because of course you
don't<00:04:34.810> want<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.140> then<00:04:35.230> blast<00:04:35.770> them<00:04:36.100> right<00:04:36.310> at

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
don't want to then blast them right at

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.680 
don't want to then blast them right at
the<00:04:36.490> end<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:36.790> how<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.150> deal<00:04:37.300> with<00:04:37.360> me<00:04:37.570> we

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
the end so how do you deal with me we

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.030 
the end so how do you deal with me we
have<00:04:37.810> brussel<00:04:38.140> sprouts<00:04:38.380> in<00:04:38.530> front<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.770> us<00:04:38.860> and

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
have brussel sprouts in front of us and

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.940 
have brussel sprouts in front of us and
I'm<00:04:39.160> thank<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.580> for<00:04:39.760> such<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.380> large<00:04:41.380> oak<00:04:41.740> said

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
I'm thank you for such a large oak said

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.190 
I'm thank you for such a large oak said
no<00:04:42.190> how<00:04:42.700> do<00:04:42.760> we<00:04:42.970> go<00:04:43.120> about<00:04:43.150> with<00:04:43.630> vegetables

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
no how do we go about with vegetables

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.150 
no how do we go about with vegetables
that<00:04:44.320> maybe<00:04:44.500> are<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> little<00:04:44.800> bit<00:04:45.040> more

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
that maybe are a little bit more

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.800 
that maybe are a little bit more
delicate<00:04:45.610> or<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.910> same<00:04:46.090> process<00:04:46.510> for<00:04:46.540> two

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
delicate or the same process for two

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.570 
delicate or the same process for two
years<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.230> we<00:04:47.380> we<00:04:47.650> need<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.920> look<00:04:48.040> at<00:04:48.190> time<00:04:48.370> and

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
years so we we need to look at time and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.490 
years so we we need to look at time and
temperature<00:04:48.820> let's<00:04:49.480> talk<00:04:49.690> about<00:04:49.870> Jerusalem

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
temperature let's talk about Jerusalem

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.410 
temperature let's talk about Jerusalem
artichokes<00:04:50.980> for<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.190> second<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:51.970> they're<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.180> lot

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
artichokes for a second so they're a lot

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.530 
artichokes for a second so they're a lot
smaller<00:04:52.870> right<00:04:53.590> done<00:04:54.100> these<00:04:54.340> right<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:55.270> in

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
smaller right done these right so in

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.150 
smaller right done these right so in
this<00:04:55.690> case<00:04:55.930> we're<00:04:56.170> talking<00:04:56.200> about<00:04:56.560> time<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
this case we're talking about time and

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.450 
this case we're talking about time and
temperature<00:04:57.550> right<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.450> two<00:04:58.690> main

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
temperature right the two main

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.620 
temperature right the two main
principles<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.610> roasting<00:05:01.030> or<00:05:01.180> time<00:05:01.390> and

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
principles of roasting or time and

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.410 
principles of roasting or time and
temperature<00:05:01.870> how<00:05:02.200> long<00:05:02.470> do<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.740> roast<00:05:02.920> it<00:05:03.100> for

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
temperature how long do you roast it for

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.630 
temperature how long do you roast it for
okay<00:05:04.420> and<00:05:04.740> what<00:05:05.740> temperature<00:05:06.190> do<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.430> roast

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
okay and what temperature do you roast

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.840 
okay and what temperature do you roast
it<00:05:06.820> at<00:05:07.090> are<00:05:07.810> going<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.110> determine<00:05:08.850> the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
it at are going to determine the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.870 
it at are going to determine the
doneness<00:05:10.090> of<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.840> vegetable<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:12.550> in<00:05:12.730> this

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
doneness of the vegetable so in this

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.250 
doneness of the vegetable so in this
case<00:05:13.150> we're<00:05:13.810> roasting<00:05:14.050> at<00:05:14.560> about<00:05:15.390> 475<00:05:16.390> so

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
case we're roasting at about 475 so

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.410 
case we're roasting at about 475 so
we're<00:05:17.650> dropping<00:05:18.070> down<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.220> temperature<00:05:18.610> and

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
we're dropping down the temperature and

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.480 
we're dropping down the temperature and
we're<00:05:19.660> going<00:05:19.870> for<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.080> slower<00:05:20.560> caramel<00:05:21.130> is<00:05:21.250> a

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
we're going for a slower caramel is a

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.969 
we're going for a slower caramel is a
of<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:22.000> vegetable<00:05:22.479> you<00:05:22.810> do<00:05:22.930> 475<00:05:23.410> break<00:05:23.860> from

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
of the vegetable you do 475 break from

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.920 
of the vegetable you do 475 break from
the<00:05:24.130> beginning<00:05:24.490> correct<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.449> this<00:05:25.630> case

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
the beginning correct and in this case

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.559 
the beginning correct and in this case
we're<00:05:26.229> actually<00:05:26.380> using<00:05:26.650> olive<00:05:27.250> oil<00:05:27.610> because

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
we're actually using olive oil because

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.129 
we're actually using olive oil because

during that process and we're letting

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.909 
during that process and we're letting
that<00:05:48.669> Jerusalem<00:05:49.360> artichoke<00:05:49.690> kind<00:05:50.020> of<00:05:50.110> lose

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
that Jerusalem artichoke kind of lose

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.879 
that Jerusalem artichoke kind of lose
some<00:05:51.370> of<00:05:51.400> its<00:05:51.580> water<00:05:51.910> right<00:05:52.569> but<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.530> olive

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
some of its water right but the olive

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.059 
some of its water right but the olive
oil<00:05:54.039> is<00:05:54.360> serving<00:05:55.360> as<00:05:55.539> a<00:05:55.569> protector<00:05:56.500> or<00:05:56.949> a

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
oil is serving as a protector or a

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.510 
oil is serving as a protector or a
shield<00:05:57.990> over<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.169> vegetable<00:05:59.470> to<00:06:00.159> create<00:06:00.490> a

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
shield over that vegetable to create a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.390 
shield over that vegetable to create a
crust<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.870> you<00:06:01.930> get<00:06:02.199> two<00:06:02.500> different<00:06:02.650> textures

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
crust so you get two different textures

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.339 
crust so you get two different textures
so<00:06:03.759> is<00:06:03.909> there<00:06:04.030> a<00:06:04.060> hard<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.449> fast<00:06:04.539> rule<00:06:04.840> of<00:06:05.199> like

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
so is there a hard and fast rule of like

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.620 
so is there a hard and fast rule of like
when<00:06:05.620> to<00:06:05.800> use<00:06:05.949> oil<00:06:06.280> and<00:06:06.550> when<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:06.970> not<00:06:07.000> use<00:06:07.360> oil

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
when to use oil and when to not use oil

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.589 
when to use oil and when to not use oil
I<00:06:07.840> wish<00:06:08.080> there<00:06:08.319> were<00:06:08.530> it<00:06:09.190> would<00:06:09.400> make<00:06:09.610> it<00:06:09.970> so

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
I wish there were it would make it so

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.649 
I wish there were it would make it so
much<00:06:11.020> easier<00:06:11.409> yeah<00:06:11.830> uh<00:06:12.220> every<00:06:13.060> vegetable<00:06:13.270> is

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
much easier yeah uh every vegetable is

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:15.180 
much easier yeah uh every vegetable is
different<00:06:14.050> yeah<00:06:14.199> everybody<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.069> that's

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
different yeah everybody and that's

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.649 
different yeah everybody and that's
really<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.580> first<00:06:15.729> rule<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:16.090> like<00:06:16.449> don't

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
really the first rule of like don't

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.240 
really the first rule of like don't
think<00:06:16.900> of<00:06:17.020> them<00:06:17.139> all<00:06:17.259> as<00:06:17.409> being<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.710> same<00:06:17.919> yeah

think of them all as being the same yeah
I<00:06:18.550> mean<00:06:18.759> people<00:06:19.389> aren't<00:06:20.259> the<00:06:20.470> same<00:06:20.680> why<00:06:21.550> should

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
I mean people aren't the same why should
