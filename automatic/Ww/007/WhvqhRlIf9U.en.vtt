in<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.690> good<00:00:00.870> old<00:00:00.930> days<00:00:01.199> thermal<00:00:02.010> paste<00:00:02.280> was

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
in the good old days thermal paste was

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.940 
in the good old days thermal paste was
kind<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.270> big<00:00:03.510> deal<00:00:03.810> everyone<00:00:04.440> had<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.799> have

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
kind of a big deal everyone had to have

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.670 
kind of a big deal everyone had to have
something<00:00:05.279> good<00:00:05.609> like<00:00:06.049> Arctic<00:00:07.049> silver<00:00:07.440> 5

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
something good like Arctic silver 5

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
CPU cooler has been good enough to the

CPU cooler has been good enough to the
point<00:00:26.189> where<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> don't<00:00:26.580> really<00:00:26.760> need<00:00:27.330> to

point where you don't really need to
mess<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> good<00:00:29.519> enough

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
mess with it but what is good enough

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.510 
mess with it but what is good enough
anyway<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:32.160> want<00:00:32.309> the

anyway what if you actually do want the

anyway what if you actually do want the
best<00:00:32.730> well<00:00:32.969> then<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:34.739> might<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
best well then you might have to go to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
cool and they have a laboratory now if

the thick pastes that you normally see

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
surface with isopropyl alcohol to give

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
surface with isopropyl alcohol to give
you<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> little<00:01:59.880> towel<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.479> some<00:02:00.659> 70%<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.350> it

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you a little towel with some 70% on it

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
you a little towel with some 70% on it
but<00:02:01.619> anything<00:02:01.860> else<00:02:02.100> works<00:02:02.460> too<00:02:02.820> after<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
but anything else works too after that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.260 
but anything else works too after that
you<00:02:04.320> use<00:02:04.500> their<00:02:04.740> cleaning<00:02:05.189> pad<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.820> step

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you use their cleaning pad this is step

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.229 
you use their cleaning pad this is step
two<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.079> scrub<00:02:07.860> by<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.550> processor

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
two to actually scrub by the processor

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.270 
two to actually scrub by the processor
and<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.929> surface<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.530> cooler<00:02:10.860> yes<00:02:11.039> it's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
and the surface of your cooler yes it's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.339 
and the surface of your cooler yes it's
essentially<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> brillo<00:02:12.360> pad<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.989> yeah

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
essentially a brillo pad and yeah

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.069 
essentially a brillo pad and yeah
it<00:02:13.680> will<00:02:14.159> rough<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.700> surfaces<00:02:15.180> which<00:02:15.420> yes

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
it will rough up the surfaces which yes

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.050 
it will rough up the surfaces which yes
could<00:02:16.500> affect<00:02:16.860> any<00:02:17.069> warranty<00:02:17.579> claims<00:02:17.879> that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
could affect any warranty claims that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.330 
could affect any warranty claims that
you<00:02:18.209> might<00:02:18.390> make<00:02:18.599> for<00:02:19.170> those<00:02:19.620> things<00:02:20.099> it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you might make for those things it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.220 
you might make for those things it's
actually<00:02:20.670> similar<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.750> prep<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:21.989> you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
actually similar to the prep that you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.530 
actually similar to the prep that you
would<00:02:22.379> do<00:02:22.500> when<00:02:22.709> sending<00:02:23.549> something<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.390> order

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
would do when sending something in order

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.500 
would do when sending something in order
to<00:02:24.659> have<00:02:25.439> paint<00:02:25.769> adhere<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> after<00:02:27.209> wiping

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
to have paint adhere to it after wiping

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.199 
to have paint adhere to it after wiping
it<00:02:27.629> down<00:02:27.659> once<00:02:28.560> again<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:29.040> step<00:02:29.459> three<00:02:29.790> you're

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
it down once again is step three you're

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.720 
it down once again is step three you're
ready<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.569> apply<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> liquid<00:02:31.560> ultra<00:02:32.340> they
