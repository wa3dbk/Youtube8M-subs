00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
screen innovations behind me I have the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.040 
screen innovations behind me I have the
new<00:00:16.350> pure<00:00:16.980> zero<00:00:17.850> edge<00:00:18.119> that's<00:00:18.690> right<00:00:18.900> we're

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
new pure zero edge that's right we're

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.960 
new pure zero edge that's right we're
using<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.410> same<00:00:19.650> hard<00:00:20.010> panel<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.789> use

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
using the same hard panel that we use

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
using the same hard panel that we use
with<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.180> Black<00:00:21.420> Diamond<00:00:21.630> zero<00:00:22.140> edge<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
with the Black Diamond zero edge and it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.259 
with the Black Diamond zero edge and it
turns<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.580> gives<00:00:23.789> us<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.029> lot<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
turns out that gives us a lot of

competitors I'd be pretty concerned
about<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> new<00:00:36.809> pure<00:00:37.230> white<00:00:37.500> zero<00:00:37.860> edge

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
about the new pure white zero edge

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.520 
about the new pure white zero edge
because<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> absolutely<00:00:39.989> without

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
because this is absolutely without

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.729 
because this is absolutely without

market and it makes a lot of sense if

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
market and it makes a lot of sense if
you<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.410> we're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you think about it because we're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
you think about it because we're
actually<00:00:47.010> able<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> manage<00:00:48.210> what's<00:00:48.420> called

actually able to manage what's called
the<00:00:48.899> grit<00:00:49.170> pattern<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.190> extremely

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the grit pattern now this is extremely

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
the grit pattern now this is extremely
important<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> embossed

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
important this is how the embossed

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
important this is how the embossed
pattern<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> screen<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.129> created<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:54.000> a

okay what's that really mean well here's
what<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:04.949> means

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
what it really means

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.090 
what it really means
check<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> image<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> screen<00:01:07.740> right

check out the image on the screen right

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
check out the image on the screen right
now<00:01:08.130> we've<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> sample<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> traditional

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
now we've got a sample of a traditional

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.730 
now we've got a sample of a traditional
white<00:01:10.700> material<00:01:11.990> simply<00:01:12.990> laid<00:01:13.380> across<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
white material simply laid across the

white material simply laid across the
top<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.460> pure<00:01:14.729> white<00:01:14.939> zero<00:01:15.360> edge<00:01:15.950> can<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
top of the pure white zero edge can you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.070 
top of the pure white zero edge can you
see<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> obviously<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.479> look<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
see it obviously you can look at the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.710 
see it obviously you can look at the
depth<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.770> field<00:01:20.100> look<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.790> how<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.180> sharper

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
depth of field look at how much sharper

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830 
depth of field look at how much sharper
the<00:01:22.110> image<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> nine<00:01:24.450> times

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the image is because of that nine times

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.990 
the image is because of that nine times

you<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> smooth<00:01:28.080> image<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.890> depth<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.640> field

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
you a smooth image with depth of field

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
you a smooth image with depth of field
like<00:01:30.060> no<00:01:30.600> other<00:01:30.810> screen<00:01:31.110> material<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.770> that

like no other screen material can that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.660 
like no other screen material can that
is<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.119> pure<00:01:33.479> zero<00:01:34.020> Edge<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
is what pure zero Edge is all about and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340 
is what pure zero Edge is all about and
that's<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.180> makes<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.720> reference

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's what makes it a reference

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.190 
that's what makes it a reference
