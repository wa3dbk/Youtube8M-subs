I've<00:01:55.560> extensively<00:01:56.310> used<00:01:56.670> ash<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> I'd<00:01:58.229> say

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
I've extensively used ash and I'd say

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.120 
I've extensively used ash and I'd say
it's<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> most<00:01:58.979> versatile<00:01:59.700> all-round<00:02:00.420> timber

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
it's the most versatile all-round timber

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.240 
it's the most versatile all-round timber
giving<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.810> combination<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.960> rigidity<00:02:04.710> and

giving a combination of rigidity and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.240 
giving a combination of rigidity and
flexibility<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.990> good<00:02:07.200> figure<00:02:07.439> I've

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
flexibility and a good figure I've

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.400 
flexibility and a good figure I've
probably<00:02:08.549> made<00:02:09.000> more<00:02:09.330> furniture<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:10.200> ash

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
probably made more furniture from ash

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.220 
probably made more furniture from ash
than<00:02:10.830> any<00:02:11.069> other<00:02:11.280> timber<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:12.750> high<00:02:12.990> back
