this right and wrong so I want to set up

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.429 
this right and wrong so I want to set up
a<00:00:20.609> grid<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.869> everything<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.380> be

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
a grid and I like everything to be

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
a grid and I like everything to be
formatted<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.100> nicely<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.880> want<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> put

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
formatted really nicely so I want to put

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.359 
formatted really nicely so I want to put
actually<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> grid<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.010> put<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
actually a grid on this and put on the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.700 
actually a grid on this and put on the
borders<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.470> assume

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
borders in so I'm going to assume

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.209 
borders in so I'm going to assume
everything<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.609> 1<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> add<00:00:30.779> ones

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
everything is 1 so I'm going to add ones

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.490 
everything is 1 so I'm going to add ones
to<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.969> want<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.600> fill<00:00:33.809> everything<00:00:34.170> with

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
to this I want to fill everything with

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.400 
to this I want to fill everything with
the<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.829> you'll<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.250> why<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> second<00:00:36.410> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the one you'll see why in a second so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.139 
the one you'll see why in a second so

kind of fills across I do that in so if

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.540 
kind of fills across I do that in so if
I<00:00:45.090> take<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.219> easily

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
some ones and zeros just with the method

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.370 
some ones and zeros just with the method
I've<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.310> described<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.080> had<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
I've just described so now I had this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.660 
I've just described so now I had this
grid<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> ones<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> zeros<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.520> wrong

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
grid of ones and zeros right or wrong

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
grid of ones and zeros right or wrong
right<00:01:24.060> easy<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.560> multiple<00:01:26.340> choice

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
right easy to do with multiple choice

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
right easy to do with multiple choice
questions<00:01:26.909> true/false<00:01:27.390> anything<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:27.840> not

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
questions true/false anything that's not

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
questions true/false anything that's not
an<00:01:28.170> open<00:01:28.530> response<00:01:28.950> everybody<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> can

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
an open response everybody I can

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.190 
an open response everybody I can
actually<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.450> an<00:01:30.540> open<00:01:30.720> response<00:01:31.049> as

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
actually do with an open response as

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
actually do with an open response as
well<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.500> I'll<00:01:31.619> show<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.860> little<00:01:32.070> later

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
well but I'll show you that little later

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.880 
well but I'll show you that little later
if<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> column<00:01:34.710> over<00:01:34.799> here

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
if we take if I go to column over here

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.850 
if we take if I go to column over here
and<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> say<00:01:35.310> equals<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.079> average<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.439> caps

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and I say equals and average all caps

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.010 
and I say equals and average all caps
and<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.549> parenthesis<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.509> select<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and a parenthesis I can select the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
and a parenthesis I can select the
average<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.130> entire<00:01:41.520> row<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
average of this entire row so this is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.550 
average of this entire row so this is
ones<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> zeros<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:45.030> tell<00:01:45.299> me<00:01:45.570> first<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
ones and zeros that will tell me first a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.600 
ones and zeros that will tell me first a
decimal<00:01:46.890> actually<00:01:47.130> want<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.280> make<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.549> a

decimal actually want to make that a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.980 
decimal actually want to make that a
percent<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.420> looks<00:01:48.600> better<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
percent because it looks better as a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.490 
percent because it looks better as a
percent<00:01:49.320> tells<00:01:49.950> me<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.369> B<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.000> got<00:01:51.540> 73

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
percent tells me that a B here got 73
percent<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.100> these<00:01:53.520> questions<00:01:53.880> correct<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.600> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
percent of these questions correct so I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
percent of these questions correct so I
see<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> average<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> actually

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
see the average right there and actually

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
see the average right there and actually
I've<00:01:57.240> time<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> myself<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> nerd

I've time to myself because I'm a nerd
and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.189> can<00:02:00.180> fill<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> take

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and I do that I can fill it in and take

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
and I do that I can fill it in and take
the<00:02:01.710> average<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.399> quicker<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.270> can

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the average here quicker then I can

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.260 
the average here quicker then I can
actually<00:02:03.540> add<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> test<00:02:04.829> by<00:02:05.610> hand<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
actually add it up on a test by hand and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.490 
actually add it up on a test by hand and
I<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.689> more<00:02:06.840> information<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.469> of

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
sixty-three percent got 13 I can pick

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.420 
sixty-three percent got 13 I can pick
out<00:03:32.690> right<00:03:32.990> away<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.470> actually<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:33.950> didn't

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
out right away and actually I didn't

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.040 
out right away and actually I didn't
really<00:03:34.610> plan<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:35.420> very<00:03:35.690> well<00:03:35.870> because<00:03:35.930> I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
really plan this very well because I

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.180 
really plan this very well because I
just<00:03:36.170> kind<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.350> threw<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.590> some<00:03:36.740> numbers<00:03:37.010> let's

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
just kind of threw in some numbers let's

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.580 
just kind of threw in some numbers let's
say<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.370> have<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> number<00:03:38.120> maybe<00:03:38.810> one<00:03:39.080> like<00:03:39.320> like

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
say I have a number maybe one like like

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.580 
say I have a number maybe one like like
15<00:03:40.220> over<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.610> we're<00:03:40.790> only<00:03:41.030> 25<00:03:41.990> percent<00:03:42.530> of

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
15 over here we're only 25 percent of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.900 
15 over here we're only 25 percent of
the<00:03:42.650> people<00:03:42.770> got<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.160> right<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.490> look<00:03:43.700> at<00:03:43.820> that

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
the people got it right I look at that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.790 
the people got it right I look at that
and<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.090> go<00:03:44.240> okay<00:03:44.780> couple<00:03:45.200> questions<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.680> don't

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
and I go okay couple questions I don't

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.260 
and I go okay couple questions I don't
look<00:03:46.010> back<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.280> question<00:03:46.550> that's<00:03:46.700> either<00:03:46.940> a

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
look back the question that's either a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.990 
look back the question that's either a
it's<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:48.110> hard<00:03:48.350> question<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.490> is<00:03:49.550> my

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
it's just a hard question and this is my

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.240 
it's just a hard question and this is my
you<00:03:50.480> know<00:03:50.600> my<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:51.080> question<00:03:51.680> my<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.830> level

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
you know my a question my a level

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.910 
you know my a question my a level
question<00:03:52.610> as<00:03:52.730> students<00:03:53.030> my<00:03:53.709> high<00:03:54.709> order

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
question as students my high order

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.350 
question as students my high order
thinking<00:03:55.010> question<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:55.970> just<00:03:56.120> difficult

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
thinking question that is just difficult

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.990 
thinking question that is just difficult
or<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.290> worded<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.040> question<00:03:58.400> poorly<00:03:58.820> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
or I worded the question poorly and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.630 
or I worded the question poorly and
people<00:03:59.420> don't<00:03:59.540> understand<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.080> or<00:04:00.459> there<00:04:01.459> was

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
people don't understand it or there was

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.190 
people don't understand it or there was
a<00:04:01.670> really<00:04:02.000> good<00:04:02.150> detractor<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.870> maybe<00:04:03.020> this

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
a really good detractor and I maybe this

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.110 
a really good detractor and I maybe this
is<00:04:03.290> something<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.530> need<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.740> cover<00:04:03.980> better<00:04:04.730> next

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
is something I need to cover better next

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.180 
is something I need to cover better next
time<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.290> can<00:04:06.410> get<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> lot<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.709> information

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
time so I can get a lot of information

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.830 
time so I can get a lot of information
just<00:04:07.340> from<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.270> some<00:04:08.390> some<00:04:08.540> simple

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
just from that just some some simple

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.800 
just from that just some some simple
averages<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.709> your<00:04:10.400> rows<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.910> columns

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.620 

so<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.920> kind<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.130> summarize<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.730> made<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> grid

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
so just kind of summarize I made a grid

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.280 
so just kind of summarize I made a grid
my<00:04:19.260> students<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.070> my<00:04:20.790> questions<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.480> filled

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
my students and my questions I filled

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.010 
my students and my questions I filled
the<00:04:22.410> whole<00:04:22.560> grid<00:04:22.770> with<00:04:22.920> ones<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.600> then<00:04:24.600> added

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the whole grid with ones I then added

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.110 
the whole grid with ones I then added
zeros<00:04:25.560> as<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.160> went<00:04:26.310> through<00:04:26.370> tests<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.030> you

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
zeros as I went through tests that you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.270 
zeros as I went through tests that you
wish<00:04:27.300> ones<00:04:27.570> they<00:04:27.810> got<00:04:27.990> wrong<00:04:28.260> basically<00:04:29.070> or

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
wish ones they got wrong basically or

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.680 
wish ones they got wrong basically or
you<00:04:29.669> could<00:04:29.790> do<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:29.970> vice<00:04:30.090> versa<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:30.510> could

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
you could do it vice versa so you could

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.930 
you could do it vice versa so you could
start<00:04:30.840> with<00:04:30.990> zeros<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.470> add<00:04:31.590> ones<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.040> took<00:04:32.669> an

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
start with zeros and add ones I took an

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.500 
start with zeros and add ones I took an
average<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.680> row<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:36.060> get<00:04:36.210> what<00:04:36.360> this

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
average of the row to get what this

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.510 
average of the row to get what this
whatever<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> student<00:04:37.350> or<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.860> on<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:38.100> I

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
whatever the student or got on that I

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.909 
whatever the student or got on that I
took<00:04:39.120> an<00:04:39.240> average<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.870> column<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.500> see<00:04:40.770> how

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
took an average of the column to see how

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.620 
took an average of the column to see how
they<00:04:41.070> did<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.430> quest<00:04:41.910> how<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.120> class<00:04:42.360> did

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
they did on that quest how the class did

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.600 
they did on that quest how the class did
on<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.900> question<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.919> that<00:04:44.220> right<00:04:44.580> there

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
on that question and that right there

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.220 
on that question and that right there
gives<00:04:44.880> me<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> lot<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.360> information<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:46.080> work

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
gives me a lot of information to work

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.470 
gives me a lot of information to work
from
