00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
now this frosting the texture of it and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.180 
now this frosting the texture of it and
the<00:01:26.270> consistency<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:27.320> about<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.979> way<00:01:28.130> you

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
the consistency is all about the way you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.190 
the consistency is all about the way you
mix<00:01:28.580> it<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.240> we're<00:01:29.390> going<00:01:29.510> to<00:01:29.659> start<00:01:29.900> by<00:01:30.020> mixing

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
mix it so we're going to start by mixing

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.649 
mix it so we're going to start by mixing
this<00:01:30.500> on<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.799> high<00:01:31.070> speed<00:01:31.130> for<00:01:31.790> five<00:01:32.119> minutes

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
this on a high speed for five minutes

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.780 
this on a high speed for five minutes
absolute<00:01:33.200> minimum<00:01:33.650> of<00:01:33.770> five<00:01:34.159> minutes<00:01:34.549> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
absolute minimum of five minutes and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.789 
absolute minimum of five minutes and
you'll<00:01:35.180> see<00:01:35.420> why<00:01:35.630> once<00:01:35.900> we<00:01:36.080> get<00:01:36.500> through<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
you'll see why once we get through the

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.719 
you'll see why once we get through the
mixing<00:01:37.250> phase<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.860> first<00:01:40.100> we're<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.549> add

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
mixing phase so first we're going to add

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.090 
mixing phase so first we're going to add
that<00:01:40.940> lemon<00:01:41.450> juice<00:01:41.690> now<00:01:41.930> we<00:01:42.409> add<00:01:42.650> lemon<00:01:43.070> juice

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
that lemon juice now we add lemon juice

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.800 
that lemon juice now we add lemon juice
because<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:43.940> provides<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.420> little<00:01:44.570> bit<00:01:44.720> of

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
because it just provides a little bit of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.750 
because it just provides a little bit of
a<00:01:44.869> tart<00:01:45.229> flavor<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.070> takes<00:01:46.280> out<00:01:46.460> some<00:01:46.610> of

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
a tart flavor and it takes out some of

00:01:46.760 --> 00:02:03.430 
a tart flavor and it takes out some of
these<00:01:46.970> sweetness<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.720> buttercream<00:01:48.080> frosting

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440

about 1/3 then I'm going to start that

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.909 
about 1/3 then I'm going to start that
mixer<00:03:03.939> on<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> low<00:03:04.359> speed<00:03:04.709> starting<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.799> on<00:03:05.889> a

mixer on a low speed starting it on a
low<00:03:06.099> speed<00:03:06.159> so<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.639> don't<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.879> up<00:03:06.970> with<00:03:07.090> too<00:03:07.239> much

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
low speed so I don't it up with too much

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.770 
low speed so I don't it up with too much
of<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.599> dust<00:03:07.870> storm<00:03:08.439> and<00:03:09.389> I'm<00:03:10.389> going<00:03:10.689> to

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
of a dust storm and I'm going to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.899 
of a dust storm and I'm going to
gradually<00:03:11.319> add<00:03:11.439> in<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.889> other<00:03:11.980> 2/3<00:03:12.579> of<00:03:12.730> that

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
gradually add in the other 2/3 of that

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:30.660 
gradually add in the other 2/3 of that
bowl<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:13.389> I'm<00:03:13.629> mixing

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.000 

now<00:03:31.670> you'll<00:03:31.819> see<00:03:32.030> here<00:03:32.269> as<00:03:32.480> I'm<00:03:32.659> mixing<00:03:33.109> it's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
now you'll see here as I'm mixing it's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.319 
now you'll see here as I'm mixing it's
actually<00:03:34.340> starting<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.730> get<00:03:34.969> just<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.299> little

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
actually starting to get just a little

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.360 
actually starting to get just a little
bit<00:03:35.780> too<00:03:35.959> dry<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.469> that's<00:03:36.620> what<00:03:36.799> our<00:03:36.889> extra<00:03:37.189> two

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
bit too dry so that's what our extra two

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.670 
bit too dry so that's what our extra two
teaspoons<00:03:37.939> of<00:03:38.060> milk<00:03:38.299> are<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:38.689> just<00:03:39.260> judge

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
teaspoons of milk are for just judge

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.039 
teaspoons of milk are for just judge
your<00:03:40.069> frosting<00:03:40.639> if<00:03:40.819> it<00:03:40.999> is<00:03:41.209> looking<00:03:41.599> like<00:03:41.749> it's

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
your frosting if it is looking like it's

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.780 
your frosting if it is looking like it's
wet<00:03:42.349> enough<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.040> going<00:03:43.249> along<00:03:43.459> nicely

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
wet enough and it's going along nicely

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.459 
wet enough and it's going along nicely
you<00:03:44.150> don't<00:03:44.329> necessarily<00:03:44.810> need<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.049> add<00:03:45.319> that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469 
you don't necessarily need to add that

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.379 
you don't necessarily need to add that
two<00:03:45.709> teaspoons<00:03:46.159> of<00:03:46.249> milk<00:03:46.459> but<00:03:47.000> I'm<00:03:47.120> going<00:03:47.329> to

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
two teaspoons of milk but I'm going to

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.699 
two teaspoons of milk but I'm going to
turn<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.599> mixer<00:03:47.900> back<00:03:48.019> on<00:03:48.230> I'm<00:03:48.349> just<00:03:48.530> going

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
turn that mixer back on I'm just going

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.289 
turn that mixer back on I'm just going
to<00:03:48.829> add<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:49.189> those<00:03:49.280> two<00:03:49.549> teaspoons<00:03:49.969> of<00:03:50.120> milk

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
to add in those two teaspoons of milk

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.759 
to add in those two teaspoons of milk
because<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:50.659> just<00:03:50.930> feel<00:03:51.049> like<00:03:51.170> this<00:03:51.349> frosting

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
because I just feel like this frosting

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.600 
because I just feel like this frosting
needs<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.129> little<00:03:52.250> bit<00:03:52.370> more<00:03:52.430> moisture

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.430 

now<00:03:59.060> we'll<00:03:59.240> turn<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.420> speed<00:03:59.900> right<00:04:00.140> up<00:04:00.290> to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
now we'll turn that speed right up to

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.010 
now we'll turn that speed right up to
high

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

we're<00:04:04.140> going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.380> let<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.560> guard<00:04:04.890> for

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
we're going to let that guard for

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.850 
we're going to let that guard for
another<00:04:05.190> five<00:04:05.430> minutes

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.259 

okay<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.190> there<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.459> have<00:04:15.489> your<00:04:15.670> completed

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
okay so there you have your completed
