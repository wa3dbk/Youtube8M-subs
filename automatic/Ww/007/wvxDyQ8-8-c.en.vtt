00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.710
 this video the technology news of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 calendar week 16 2014 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.010
 Google could soon contact lenses 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.599
 bring out these cameras 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.429
 Contact lenses do not contain only then 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 the image sensor but also still 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 control electronics and a sensor 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.980
 with the one with targeted brush 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.320
 movements can take a picture 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.689
 The contact lens should then be with the radio 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 forward a picture to a smartphone, for example 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.289
 In addition, the contacts should also have a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 small screen with which one 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 then the photo could look directly 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.260
 google writable applications 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.600
 all of them on an image analysis 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.040
 The lens should then run out in this way 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 connect with a smartphone for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 visually impaired can evaluate whether the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 crossing a street is safe 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 lens is also still the field of view 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 can expand and color objects 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.809
 highlight with and soon 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.340
 could collide together mds level note 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.930
 game package is coming back 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.690
 moreover, most of them are none 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.489
 real new top title with it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 moderate so suspicious is not yet 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.510
 released deep is a new wii play 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.390
 title but otherwise are actually only 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 older triple a title with it from 9 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.799
 There are three 295x2 up to 280 iks 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 play until the 260 there are two games 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.350
 up to 240 there is then a game here 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.700
 to note at the 250 and 240 you have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 restrictions on the choice 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.830
 nvidia is currently playing as only 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.420
 daylight with that the controller 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.460
 can be available from october 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.650
 to come to the latest knowledge 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.110
 that the controller in october resp 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.820
 november 2014 out there 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 meanwhile a new version of the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.079
 controllers can do without touchpads 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.310
 and on classical keys the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.439
 controller is of course mainly 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.549
 but you can think of it for the cinema 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.590
 of course ours as well 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.570
 windows use to the end of this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.840
 year it is already 500 games 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.009
 give that you can play on steam os 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.200
 not only the support for windows xp 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.719
 is set but also for that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.060
 completely outdated windows 8 microsoft 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.240
 will be in support of windows 8 from 13 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 may 2014 set by then then must 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.500
 everyone updated to windows 8.1 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.539
 but this is about a simple 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.819
 update 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.219
 This said that this year no 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.200
 Processors and graphics cards in 20 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.760
 naked procedures come in the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 But I have the latest technology news 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.450
 Rumors about the new amd cards 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.379
 either this is very reported 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.599
 just not true 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.730
 or it comes from amg but such a gpu 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.900
 gigant this one becomes a very very abo 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.000
 his power hungry 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.069
 Moreover, then probably assume 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.920
 that this year from the new consoles 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.470
 no slim version come community that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.569
 the 20 nanometer processors only in the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
 Design phase are in the future 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.829
 is also still 16 nanometers 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.319
 she probably means so much 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.540
 that 16 nanometer processors still one 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.370
 Whole way do not need earlier than 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.280
 2016 probably times 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.169
 has the structure width intel 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.209
 officially confirmed that they are with the 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.579
 Production of 14 nanometer processors 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.370
 have started and bag procession 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.329
 the end of the second half of 2014 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.950
 will appear 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.230
 first the notebook appears 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.879
 Processors about the release of the desktop 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.620
 nothing is known about processors 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.629
 the distance should not however 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.519
 be especially tall until the fourth 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.979
 quarter of this year should be out 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.930
 several factories have a large amount of 14 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.659
 naked chips comes to the second 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.280
 Half of 2015 then island with the 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.829
 production of skylight beginning 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.959
 if they will then appear in 2015 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.449
 Can not confirm island though 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.400
 puts island now so fully in the schedule 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.900
 I would like to point this out again 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.909
 that is at the hardware shipping 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.979
 join in the competition and still likes 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.359
 need link to the contest comment 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.250
 I have in the video description 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.139
 we should really be very packed 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.569
 happy if all of you would like that 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.069
 It only takes a few seconds that was 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.930
 it also with the technical ones 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.549
 week if you like it again 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.590
 goes up in a thumb if you 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.370
 last load of the nabu then up to 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.370
 next video
