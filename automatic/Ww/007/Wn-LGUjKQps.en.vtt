00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is used to take care of and we have to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.950

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
variety of things like that so it's not

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
variety of things like that so it's not
worth<00:00:48.480> pushing<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> the
