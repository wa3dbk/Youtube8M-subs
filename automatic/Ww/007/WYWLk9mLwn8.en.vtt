the<00:00:41.480> landscape<00:00:41.930> board<00:00:42.170> there

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
the landscape board there

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.500 
the landscape board there
I<00:00:42.559> really<00:00:43.370> enjoyed<00:00:43.670> viewing<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.120> work<00:00:44.300> and

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
I really enjoyed viewing the work and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.540 
I really enjoyed viewing the work and
learning<00:00:45.260> about<00:00:45.530> some<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.800> these<00:00:45.890> locations

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
learning about some of these locations

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.910 
learning about some of these locations
I<00:00:46.670> noticed<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:47.600> some<00:00:47.749> photographers<00:00:48.649> were

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
I noticed that some photographers were

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.649 
I noticed that some photographers were
very<00:00:49.100> selective<00:00:49.640> with<00:00:49.820> what<00:00:50.059> they<00:00:50.179> said<00:00:50.390> about

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
very selective with what they said about

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.649 
very selective with what they said about
a<00:00:50.839> location<00:00:51.499> they<00:00:52.219> might<00:00:52.429> say<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.149> was<00:00:53.269> in<00:00:53.570> a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
a location they might say it was in a

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.989 
a location they might say it was in a
Canyon<00:00:54.109> in<00:00:54.350> Utah<00:00:54.980> or<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:55.670> was<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:55.909> the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
Canyon in Utah or it was in the

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.779 
Canyon in Utah or it was in the
wilderness<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:56.690> Arizona<00:00:57.319> and<00:00:57.589> it<00:00:58.339> seemed<00:00:58.670> a

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
wilderness in Arizona and it seemed a

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.520 
wilderness in Arizona and it seemed a
bit<00:00:58.909> strange<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.510> me<00:00:59.629> at<00:00:59.870> first<00:00:59.899> when<00:01:00.409> I<00:01:00.469> was

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
bit strange to me at first when I was

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.319 
bit strange to me at first when I was
getting<00:01:00.800> into<00:01:01.069> it<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.429> people<00:01:01.760> were<00:01:01.909> very

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
getting into it that people were very

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.420 
getting into it that people were very
reluctant<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.989> say<00:01:03.800> more<00:01:04.010> about<00:01:04.070> these

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
reluctant to say more about these

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.120 
reluctant to say more about these
locations<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.750> kind<00:01:06.409> of<00:01:06.470> in<00:01:06.590> my<00:01:06.620> mind<00:01:06.740> at<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
locations and kind of in my mind at the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.469 
locations and kind of in my mind at the
time<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.370> thought<00:01:07.760> that<00:01:08.000> maybe<00:01:08.180> these<00:01:08.420> people

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
time I thought that maybe these people

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.770 
time I thought that maybe these people
were<00:01:09.820> protective<00:01:10.820> over<00:01:11.030> these<00:01:11.180> locations

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
were protective over these locations

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.690 
were protective over these locations
because<00:01:12.260> they<00:01:12.530> felt<00:01:12.800> if<00:01:12.979> someone<00:01:13.310> knew<00:01:13.520> where

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
because they felt if someone knew where

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.700 
because they felt if someone knew where
it<00:01:13.760> was<00:01:13.880> they<00:01:14.570> would<00:01:14.780> go<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.170> steal<00:01:15.469> that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
it was they would go and steal that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.389 
it was they would go and steal that
photo<00:01:16.869> now<00:01:17.869> that<00:01:18.229> I've<00:01:18.409> been<00:01:18.649> doing<00:01:18.979> landscape

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
photo now that I've been doing landscape

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.910 
photo now that I've been doing landscape
for<00:01:19.610> photography<00:01:20.420> for<00:01:20.689> a<00:01:20.960> while<00:01:21.229> now<00:01:21.469> I've

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
for photography for a while now I've

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.649 
for photography for a while now I've
realized<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.880> there's<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.329> whole<00:01:23.509> nother

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
realized that there's a whole nother

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.459 
realized that there's a whole nother
side<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.850> it's<00:01:25.850> really<00:01:26.149> two<00:01:26.780> aspects

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
side to this and it's really two aspects

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.219 
side to this and it's really two aspects
the<00:01:28.369> first<00:01:28.579> is<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.299> many<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.689> these<00:01:29.780> areas

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
the first is that many of these areas

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.469 
the first is that many of these areas
are<00:01:30.469> very<00:01:30.530> fragile<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:31.820> know<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.299> I've

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
are very fragile and I know that I've

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.170 
are very fragile and I know that I've
gone<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.320> many<00:01:33.680> places<00:01:33.979> where<00:01:34.430> I<00:01:34.460> feel<00:01:34.909> very

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
gone to many places where I feel very

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.120 
gone to many places where I feel very
guilty<00:01:35.450> even<00:01:36.200> walking<00:01:36.799> through<00:01:37.009> these

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
guilty even walking through these

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.580 
guilty even walking through these
locations<00:01:37.729> because<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.270> see<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.869> I'm<00:01:38.990> you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
locations because I see that I'm you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.679 
locations because I see that I'm you
know<00:01:39.680> leaving<00:01:39.950> behind<00:01:40.189> footprints<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.119> that

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
know leaving behind footprints and that

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.450 
know leaving behind footprints and that
it<00:01:41.810> might<00:01:41.990> lead<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:42.320> some<00:01:42.890> degree<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.340> erosion

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
it might lead to some degree of erosion

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.940 
it might lead to some degree of erosion
and<00:01:44.359> if<00:01:44.689> I<00:01:44.780> feel<00:01:44.990> very<00:01:45.170> guilty<00:01:45.409> about<00:01:45.619> going

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and if I feel very guilty about going

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.849 
and if I feel very guilty about going
back<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.700> those<00:01:46.820> areas<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:48.439> am<00:01:48.649> NOT

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
back in those areas I really am NOT

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.649 
back in those areas I really am NOT
gonna<00:01:49.009> want<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.549> bunch<00:01:49.759> of<00:01:49.880> other<00:01:50.030> people<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.509> go

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
gonna want a bunch of other people to go

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.020 
gonna want a bunch of other people to go
and<00:01:51.049> follow<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.439> same<00:01:51.649> footsteps<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.460> I've

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and follow the same footsteps and I've

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.959 
and follow the same footsteps and I've
seen<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> lot<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:54.399> situations<00:01:55.399> where<00:01:55.670> there's

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
seen a lot of situations where there's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.109 
seen a lot of situations where there's
been<00:01:56.619> illegal<00:01:57.619> workshops<00:01:58.070> where<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:59.000> know

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
been illegal workshops where you know

where I was and this has really come

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.220 
where I was and this has really come
into<00:02:16.310> play<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:17.000> places<00:02:17.570> like<00:02:17.600> Zion<00:02:18.140> National

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
Park for example there are some areas

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.990 
Park for example there are some areas
last<00:02:21.260> year<00:02:21.560> where<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.800> went<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.489> I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
last year where I went to and I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.240 
last year where I went to and I
intentionally<00:02:23.330> didn't<00:02:23.750> record

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
intentionally didn't record

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.640 
intentionally didn't record
a video<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.360> also<00:02:25.540> I'll<00:02:26.080> admit<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.410> giving

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
a video and I also I'll admit to giving

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.590 
a video and I also I'll admit to giving
some<00:02:27.070> very<00:02:27.280> misleading<00:02:27.520> information<00:02:27.940> about

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
some very misleading information about

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.710 
some very misleading information about
even<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.020> general<00:02:29.350> vicinity<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.890> where<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.310> was

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
even the general vicinity of where I was

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.240 
even the general vicinity of where I was
because<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.750> didn't<00:02:32.290> want<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.710> return<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
because I didn't want to return to that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.910 
because I didn't want to return to that
area<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:34.060> couple<00:02:34.450> years<00:02:34.630> later<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.290> see<00:02:35.590> that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
area a couple years later and see that

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.530 
area a couple years later and see that
there's<00:02:36.130> just<00:02:36.190> foot<00:02:36.550> traffic<00:02:37.000> all<00:02:37.180> over<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
place and actually I've seen some of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.100 
place and actually I've seen some of
that<00:02:40.300> in<00:02:40.390> Zion<00:02:41.200> last<00:02:41.650> year<00:02:42.040> when<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.520> went<00:02:42.700> there

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
when the same areas I returned to year

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.420 
when the same areas I returned to year
after<00:02:46.510> year<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.140> check<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.130> kind<00:02:48.400> of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
trails all over the place and it had

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.430 
trails all over the place and it had
killed<00:03:04.180> off<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.510> grass<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.170> was<00:03:05.260> leading

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
killed off the grass and it was leading

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.830 
killed off the grass and it was leading
to<00:03:05.560> some<00:03:05.709> erosion<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:07.360> really<00:03:07.510> sad

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
to some erosion and it was really sad

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.690 
to some erosion and it was really sad
just<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.260> sit<00:03:08.470> there<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.920> look<00:03:09.130> at<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.310> and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
just to sit there and look at that and

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.370 
just to sit there and look at that and
to<00:03:09.910> realize<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.270> only<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.840> couple<00:03:11.260> years

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
to realize that only a couple years

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.320 
to realize that only a couple years
before<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.459> will<00:03:12.640> look<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> lush

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
before that it will look like a lush

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.470 
before that it will look like a lush
paradise<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:15.070> some<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.280> these<00:03:15.370> areas<00:03:15.820> where

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
paradise so in some of these areas where

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.020 
paradise so in some of these areas where
there<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:16.900> going<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.380> be<00:03:17.739> more<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.580> fragile

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
there is going to be more of a fragile

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.699 
there is going to be more of a fragile
ecosystem

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
ecosystem

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.590

I<00:03:20.739> will<00:03:21.250> definitely<00:03:21.400> admit<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.150> not<00:03:22.390> being

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
I will definitely admit to not being

I will definitely admit to not being

completely honest about where I am I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.390 
completely honest about where I am I
will<00:03:26.050> give<00:03:26.170> misleading<00:03:26.620> information<00:03:26.800> but

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
will give misleading information but

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.770 
will give misleading information but
this<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.580> all<00:03:27.670> just<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.940> protect<00:03:28.299> that<00:03:28.510> area

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
this is all just to protect that area

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.530 
this is all just to protect that area
now<00:03:29.739> there's<00:03:29.950> another<00:03:30.130> component<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.730> secrecy

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
now there's another component of secrecy

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.440 
now there's another component of secrecy
when<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.080> comes<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.790> landscape<00:03:33.790> photography

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
and this is something that deals with

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.430 
and this is something that deals with
human<00:03:37.390> nature

know<00:05:03.620> where<00:05:03.860> specifically<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.460> am<00:05:04.580> in<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:04.910> park

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
know where specifically I am in the park

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.810 
know where specifically I am in the park
and<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:06.350> like<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.740> think<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.040> this<00:05:07.220> is<00:05:07.430> for

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
and I like to think that this is for

and I like to think that this is for

your own good because if I were to find

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.120 
your own good because if I were to find
some<00:05:11.660> really<00:05:11.840> cool<00:05:12.110> area<00:05:12.320> and<00:05:12.800> if<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:13.010> were<00:05:13.070> to

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
some really cool area and if I were to

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.030 
some really cool area and if I were to
say<00:05:13.310> specifically<00:05:13.880> where<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.330> is<00:05:14.479> then<00:05:15.410> people

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
say specifically where it is then people

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.260 
say specifically where it is then people
would<00:05:16.250> go<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.729> and<00:05:16.850> they're<00:05:16.940> not<00:05:17.030> going<00:05:17.180> to

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
would go to it and they're not going to

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.420 
would go to it and they're not going to
have<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.510> same<00:05:17.690> respect<00:05:18.080> for<00:05:18.229> it<00:05:18.470> as<00:05:18.590> when<00:05:19.400> I

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
have the same respect for it as when I

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.110 
have the same respect for it as when I
found<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:21.919> that's<00:05:22.220> that's<00:05:22.880> another

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
found it and so that's that's another

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.180 
found it and so that's that's another
big<00:05:23.510> component<00:05:23.960> of<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.350> surface<00:05:24.530> secrecy

being<00:05:31.940> completely<00:05:32.479> forthcoming

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
being completely forthcoming

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.700 
being completely forthcoming
with<00:05:33.470> all<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.770> information<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:36.169> think

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
with all the information and I think

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.680 
with all the information and I think
that's<00:05:37.070> that's<00:05:37.460> important<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.090> do<00:05:38.270> from<00:05:38.570> the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
that's that's important to do from the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.480 
that's that's important to do from the
standpoint<00:05:39.139> of<00:05:39.350> telling<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.770> story<00:05:39.800> of<00:05:40.190> the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
standpoint of telling the story of the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.790 
standpoint of telling the story of the
location<00:05:41.030> but<00:05:41.720> not<00:05:41.780> every<00:05:42.140> detail<00:05:42.260> really

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
location but not every detail really

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.600 
location but not every detail really
needs<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.190> be<00:05:43.370> known<00:05:44.169> and<00:05:45.169> I'd<00:05:45.350> say<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:45.650> over

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
needs to be known and I'd say that over

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.420 
needs to be known and I'd say that over
the<00:05:46.729> past<00:05:46.940> year<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:48.530> two<00:05:48.680> trips<00:05:48.890> I<00:05:49.039> went<00:05:49.220> to

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
the past year the two trips I went to

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.880 
the past year the two trips I went to
one<00:05:49.820> in<00:05:49.940> Death<00:05:50.120> Valley<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:51.560> then<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.770> other

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
one in Death Valley and then the other

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.779 
one in Death Valley and then the other
one<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.580> neon<00:05:53.030> canyon<00:05:54.130> two<00:05:55.130> of<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.340> shots<00:05:55.610> I

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
one to neon canyon two of the shots I

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.590 
one to neon canyon two of the shots I
took<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:57.050> was<00:05:57.850> intentionally<00:05:58.850> misleading<00:05:59.270> on

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
took I was intentionally misleading on

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.040 
took I was intentionally misleading on
exactly<00:06:00.500> where<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.100> was<00:06:01.280> at<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.490> time<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:02.090> I

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
exactly where I was at the time and I

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.540 
exactly where I was at the time and I
don't<00:06:03.110> think<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:03.770> takes<00:06:03.979> anything<00:06:04.250> away

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
don't think that takes anything away

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.120 
don't think that takes anything away
from<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:05.720> shot<00:06:05.960> at<00:06:06.110> all<00:06:06.229> I<00:06:06.470> think<00:06:06.590> if<00:06:06.950> anything

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
from the shot at all I think if anything

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.580 
from the shot at all I think if anything
it<00:06:07.400> adds<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:08.180> sense<00:06:08.810> of<00:06:08.930> mystery<00:06:09.229> a<00:06:09.320> little

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
it adds to a sense of mystery a little

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.860 
it adds to a sense of mystery a little
bit<00:06:09.710> and<00:06:09.979> if<00:06:10.430> you<00:06:10.520> can<00:06:10.729> find<00:06:10.910> these<00:06:11.000> areas<00:06:11.240> more

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
bit and if you can find these areas more

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.610 
bit and if you can find these areas more
power<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.320> you

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
power to you

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.990 
power to you
and<00:06:12.740> I<00:06:12.800> hope<00:06:12.919> you<00:06:13.039> respect<00:06:13.430> them<00:06:13.520> as<00:06:13.610> much<00:06:13.729> as<00:06:13.910> I

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
and I hope you respect them as much as I

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.930 
and I hope you respect them as much as I
do
