00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 everyone knows about crowdfunding project 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 kickstarter on which many 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.320
 developers who can't find 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.240
 publishers either don't want to negotiate with 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.070
 put them on their bondage conditions 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.930
 your projects on a special page where 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.460
 ordinary gamers as we can 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220
 donate money from your wallet 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.720
 foundation help create this or that game and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.699
 it's really cool because 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.359
 this project has already been born quite a lot 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.609
 cool games 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.230
 however the former teacher was and kyle those 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.390
 the most that gave us the first and second 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.040
 Part of Fellow's read this system is not 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 quite fair after all like 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.070
 they say they are people who donated 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.930
 money to create virtual points 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 reality will not be able to get their 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 interest from selling it from now on 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 gigantic project or really on 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 kickstarter donate money gamer 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.890
 gets maybe the very copy of the game which 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.780
 additional bonuses and buns but not 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.329
 money, in principle, is probably quite 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 itself normally but Fergus Urquhart Brian 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.600
 fargo and tim shafer created their 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.070
 own project on which games 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.989
 which you will finance in 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 the future will bring you profit that is you 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.530
 you can become full investors 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
 sorry at the moment to become 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.189
 an investor can only the so -called 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.990
 accredited investors but how are they 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.400
 assure the future these subtleties will 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.840
 settled and everyone can 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.340
 participate in such a project 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 the only weird thing in everything and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.580
 this that at the time of the creation of the game on 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 only one site can be 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.909
 one project will decide exactly which one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.799
 this is the trinity 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 that is, you submit your application if 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 want to make a game they view it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.860
 and a few hundred more applications from 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.049
 other teams and robs you maybe 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.729
 the only participant in their project can 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.829
 say that it is very fair for 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.659
 towards developers but definitely 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.250
 very cool for gamers by the way on 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.530
 currently one such is running 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 company to introduce the game outer world 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.790
 with all this you can on the official 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 site new kickstarter FIG. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.140
 what do you think about crowdfunding 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.630

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.280
