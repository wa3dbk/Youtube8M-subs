00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
here all the way to here is am I getting

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
here all the way to here is am I getting
it<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:46.670> fully<00:01:47.670> lock<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.210> word<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it is fully lock take my word for it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.440 
it is fully lock take my word for it
it's<00:01:48.780> fully<00:01:48.930> locked<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:50.100> notice<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it's fully locked I do notice that this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.469

and<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:53.369> locks<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.790> I've<00:01:53.939> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> like

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and the locks that I've kind of like

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
and the locks that I've kind of like
started<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.960> interlock<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.280> bit<00:01:56.460> are

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
started to interlock a little bit are

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.719 
started to interlock a little bit are
locking<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.350> lot<00:01:58.619> faster<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.369> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
locking a lot faster and I know that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.649 
locking a lot faster and I know that
it's<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> tighter<00:02:00.810> hold<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.299> maybe<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.509> my

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it's like a tighter hold so maybe in my

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.690 
it's like a tighter hold so maybe in my
mind<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.140> locking<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
mind it's locking and it really it's

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.990 
mind it's locking and it really it's
locked<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.299> really<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
locked but really is it but I think that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
locked but really is it but I think that
gathering<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> hair<00:02:10.170> brings<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.860> closer

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
gathering of the hair brings it closer

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.050 
gathering of the hair brings it closer
together<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.760> tie

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
together and tie

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.479 
together and tie
so<00:02:12.630> even<00:02:12.840> at<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> point<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.620> interlocked

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
so even at the point that I interlocked

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.000 
so even at the point that I interlocked
even<00:02:15.450> though<00:02:15.569> that's<00:02:15.750> tight<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.440> noticing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
even though that's tight I'm noticing

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.949 
even though that's tight I'm noticing
that<00:02:17.220> my<00:02:17.310> hair<00:02:17.640> underneath<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.330> over<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.810> is

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
that my hair underneath and over it is

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.410 
that my hair underneath and over it is
locking<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.650> little<00:02:19.920> bit<00:02:20.010> quicker<00:02:20.700> or<00:02:21.000> faster

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
locking a little bit quicker or faster

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.360 
locking a little bit quicker or faster
as<00:02:21.569> well<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.560> sure<00:02:22.770> that's<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
as well so I'm sure that's just the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.360 
as well so I'm sure that's just the
gathering<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> hair<00:02:24.270> that's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
gathering of the hair that's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.979 
gathering of the hair that's
contributing<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.540> mean<00:02:27.750> not

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
contributing to that so I mean not

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.280 
contributing to that so I mean not
really<00:02:28.319> much<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.709> update<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.370> am<00:02:30.290> noticing

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
really much of an update I am noticing

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
really much of an update I am noticing
budding<00:02:31.860> there<00:02:32.370> are<00:02:32.580> definitely<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
budding there are definitely the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.680 
budding there are definitely the
twisting<00:02:33.660> pattern<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.769> still<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.580> hair<00:02:35.970> all

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
twisting pattern is still in my hair all

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140 
twisting pattern is still in my hair all
throughout<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.890> sure<00:02:38.580> that's<00:02:38.790> gonna<00:02:38.910> take

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
throughout so I'm sure that's gonna take

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.420 
throughout so I'm sure that's gonna take
some<00:02:39.180> time<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:40.230> go<00:02:40.410> away<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:43.430> there's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
some time to go away and then there's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.550 
some time to go away and then there's
locking<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.269> budding<00:02:45.799> really<00:02:46.799> along<00:02:47.130> every

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
locking and budding really along every

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.199 
locking and budding really along every
every<00:02:49.560> lock<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:51.560> yeah<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.850> my<00:02:54.000> hair

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
every lock so yeah this is what my hair

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.039 
every lock so yeah this is what my hair
looks<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.799> at<00:02:55.799> four<00:02:56.280> months<00:02:56.790> with<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> two

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
looks like at four months with a two

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.630 
looks like at four months with a two
strand<00:02:58.349> twist<00:02:59.120> method<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.709> start<00:03:01.709> locking<00:03:04.640> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
strand twist method to start locking and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.180 
strand twist method to start locking and
I'm<00:03:06.299> just<00:03:06.480> enjoying<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.440> journey<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
I'm just enjoying the journey and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.539 
I'm just enjoying the journey and
letting<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.060> take<00:03:09.239> its<00:03:09.450> course<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:11.130> guess

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
letting it take its course so I guess

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.430 
letting it take its course so I guess
I'll<00:03:11.730> try<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> give<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.599> guys<00:03:12.750> an<00:03:12.900> update<00:03:13.019> at

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
I'll try to give you guys an update at

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.350 
I'll try to give you guys an update at
five<00:03:13.739> months<00:03:14.040> maybe<00:03:14.489> it'll<00:03:14.849> be<00:03:14.970> five<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.330> a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
five months maybe it'll be five and a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.199 
five months maybe it'll be five and a
half<00:03:15.510> maybe<00:03:15.690> it'll<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.109> six<00:03:16.410> because<00:03:16.859> I<00:03:17.209> think

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
half maybe it'll be six because I think

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.020 
half maybe it'll be six because I think
at<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.480> stage<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.959> really<00:03:19.170> isn't<00:03:19.350> much<00:03:20.030> to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
at this stage it really isn't much to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.990 
at this stage it really isn't much to
report<00:03:21.359> it's<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.810> all<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.350> waiting<00:03:22.769> game<00:03:23.000> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
report it's just all a waiting game and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.759 
report it's just all a waiting game and
then<00:03:24.269> as<00:03:24.420> far<00:03:24.570> as<00:03:24.630> styling<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.350> had<00:03:25.590> been

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
then as far as styling I had been

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.410 
then as far as styling I had been
styling<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.519> little<00:03:26.700> bit<00:03:26.910> kind<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.239> like

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
styling it a little bit kind of like

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.289 
styling it a little bit kind of like
braiding<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.609> twisting<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.850> things<00:03:30.120> like

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
braiding and twisting it and things like

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.180 
braiding and twisting it and things like
that<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.780> doing<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.200> braid<00:03:31.530> out<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:31.980> can

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that and doing like braid out so I can

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.509 
that and doing like braid out so I can
get<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.459> crinkly<00:03:32.910> looking<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:34.709> my<00:03:34.980> mind<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
get that crinkly looking in my mind I

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.770 
get that crinkly looking in my mind I
probably<00:03:35.790> shouldn't<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.390> should<00:03:36.690> be

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
probably shouldn't be I should be

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.460 
probably shouldn't be I should be
allowing<00:03:37.170> my<00:03:37.290> hair<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.680> set<00:03:38.010> instead<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.000> like

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
allowing my hair to set instead of like

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.020 
allowing my hair to set instead of like
stretching<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.709> out<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.370> then<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:42.000> know

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
stretching it out and then you know

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.849 
stretching it out and then you know
missing<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.019> they<00:03:43.079> can<00:03:43.260> lock<00:03:43.410> back<00:03:43.680> to

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
missing it so that they can lock back to

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.599 
missing it so that they can lock back to
you<00:03:44.160> know<00:03:44.280> kind<00:03:44.819> of<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:45.060> stroll<00:03:45.690> back<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:46.109> I

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
you know kind of like stroll back up I

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.789 
you know kind of like stroll back up I
don't<00:03:47.609> know<00:03:47.730> I'm<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.750> kind<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.350> learning<00:03:49.560> if

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
don't know I'm just kind of learning if

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.650 
don't know I'm just kind of learning if
that<00:03:49.950> go<00:03:50.160> at<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.670> point<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.889> don't<00:03:52.889> know<00:03:53.660> so
