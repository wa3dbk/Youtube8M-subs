00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 2:46 pm in the middle 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.040
 Welcome to that moment 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.190
 Huge earthquake with a maximum seismic intensity of 7 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.470
 Pedestrian figure squatting down to much shaking 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.480
 Hmm 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.960
 About one hour before 4:00 pm 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 It was when the car stopped in a traffic jam 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.990
 From the left of the screen 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.830
 What number cars flowed into tsunami 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.830
 Feces 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.570
 Imachi Torture color 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.970
 Now O'surging tsunami from behind 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:08.229
 Only 10 seconds No. tsunami in the car has reached 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.229
 Mr. Muroga's car is starting to be pushed forward gradually 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 And after 25 seconds the car is completely lifted 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.270
 I lose control and begin to drift 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.330
 At this time, Mr. Muroka was still staying in- house 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.330
 The 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.720
 Mr. Muroga's car must be a black wagon ahead 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.409
 Some of the demons are male figures 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.940
 I am thinking 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.480
 Hmm 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.070
 I thought about running away right after this collision 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.940
 That the window was opened 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.940
 You should take it and send it 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:07.120
 While the outer wall in front of the screen and the car slowly flow in the right direction, the great speed in the screen country 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:09.150
 The track is swept to the left at 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.150
 Oh 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.640
 Good man in a crashed wagon 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.470
 I also see evacuation on the car 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.310
 If not thinking 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.660
 There was a sound 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.170
 And slowly the car to change the orientation 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.790
 Then the camera rushes from between the buildings 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.790
 It captures the intense flow 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.540
 The broadcast which tells the damage of the tsunami which happened in another place in the antiques 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.560
 It does not become ancient 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
 We were able to chance 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.690
 At this time, Mr. Muroga said that he had been thinking if he would escape five cars at his company 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:22.430
 And about 4 minutes after beginning to be washed away 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.430
 The car was caught in a fast flowing water stream so that it could be sucked up 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.560
 Behaved is shaken greatly to the up and down 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.560
 Another car was in front of me 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.860
 The car that started to rotate still carries Mr. Muroka 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 Sand minnie keeps flowing 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.560
 Have 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.349
 And 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.349
 About 4 minutes from the tsunami encounter 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.260
 I think 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:25.230
 Where a car collides with a building and sinks into the water 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.230
 The picture was broken
