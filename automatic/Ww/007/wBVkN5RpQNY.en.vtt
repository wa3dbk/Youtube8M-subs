the world it is three pins live neutral
and<00:00:23.189> earth<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.820> top<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.210> longest<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> I'm

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and earth the top the longest one so I'm

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.290 
and earth the top the longest one so I'm
going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.189> show<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> had<00:00:26.550> wire<00:00:26.760> three<00:00:27.090> core

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
going to show I had wire three core

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.040 
going to show I had wire three core
cable<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:28.760> safety<00:00:29.760> engine<00:00:29.970> spoke<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> screw

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
cable a safety engine spoke so the screw

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.389 
cable a safety engine spoke so the screw
in<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> center<00:00:34.380> generally<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:35.070> open<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in the center generally will open the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
in the center generally will open the
bloke<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.270> screw<00:00:36.540> holds<00:00:36.780> together<00:00:42.290> now

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
bloke just one screw holds together now

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
bloke just one screw holds together now
we<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.860> three<00:00:44.010> terminals<00:00:44.219> with

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we can see we have three terminals with

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
we can see we have three terminals with
screw<00:00:45.270> blocks<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.719> them<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.460> here

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
screw blocks on them so one here is here

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.750 
screw blocks on them so one here is here
live<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.660> will<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.899> brown<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:50.160> goes<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
live it will be brown it goes into the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450 
live it will be brown it goes into the
fuse<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.649> the<00:00:52.649> blue<00:00:52.800> will<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> neutral

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
fuse and the blue will go to the neutral

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
fuse and the blue will go to the neutral
over<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> left<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> top<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.289> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
over on the left and then the top one is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.880 
over on the left and then the top one is
the<00:00:55.710> earth<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> we're<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> strip<00:00:59.699> back<00:00:59.879> a

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
the earth so we're going to strip back a

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.139 
the earth so we're going to strip back a
generous<00:01:01.890> metal<00:01:02.190> wire<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.579> cut<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> off<00:01:02.969> if

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
generous metal wire we can cut it off if

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.690 
generous metal wire we can cut it off if
it's<00:01:03.300> too<00:01:03.420> long<00:01:03.890> that's<00:01:04.890> about<00:01:05.189> 40<00:01:05.580> 50

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's too long that's about 40 50

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
it's too long that's about 40 50
millimetres<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:09.080> we're<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> strip<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
millimetres and we're going to strip the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.359 
millimetres and we're going to strip the
wire<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> green<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.790> leave<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> longest

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
wire the green one we leave the longest

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.200 
wire the green one we leave the longest
strip<00:01:14.369> back<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.790> 10<00:01:15.030> mil<00:01:15.210> 11<00:01:19.970> we're<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
strip back a 10 mil 11 we're going to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.490 
strip back a 10 mil 11 we're going to
cost<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:22.580> 15<00:01:23.580> millimetres<00:01:24.350> what's<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
cost about 15 millimetres what's the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:47.270 
cost about 15 millimetres what's the
next<00:01:25.650> two<00:01:27.170> also<00:01:28.170> strip<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.650> then

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.000 

so<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> find<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.240> quickest<00:01:48.510> way<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.830> wire<00:01:49.830> up

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
so I find the quickest way to wire up

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.810 
so I find the quickest way to wire up
your<00:01:50.160> three<00:01:50.370> terminals<00:01:50.910> is<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.020> pop<00:01:52.820> three

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
your three terminals is to pop three

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.490 
your three terminals is to pop three
legs<00:01:54.030> out<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:58.590> use<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> fusing<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.350> just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
legs out can use the fusing and just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.120 
legs out can use the fusing and just
wire<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.880> hand<00:02:03.060> turn<00:02:03.300> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> bench

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
wire them in your hand turn on the bench

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.340 
wire them in your hand turn on the bench
so<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> longest<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.990> earth<00:02:12.350> so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
so the longest one is your earth so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.760 
so the longest one is your earth so
tighten<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.890> down<00:02:13.950> nice<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.459> snug<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.680> we

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
tighten that down nice and snug and we

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.839 
tighten that down nice and snug and we
go<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> blue<00:02:17.220> with<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> other<00:02:18.120> pin

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.509 

and<00:02:24.849> then<00:02:25.000> brown<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.370> holds

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
and then brown for the one that holds

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:38.839 
and then brown for the one that holds
fuse

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:53.780 

so<00:02:39.849> now<00:02:39.939> we<00:02:40.030> pop<00:02:40.180> these<00:02:40.360> back<00:02:40.629> into<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.110> plug

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.069 

this<00:02:54.480> time<00:02:54.720> we're<00:02:54.959> going<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:58.040> loosen<00:03:00.079> strain

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
this time we're going to loosen strain

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.910 
this time we're going to loosen strain
reef<00:03:01.319> from<00:03:01.439> the<00:03:01.530> cable<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:03.409> and<00:03:04.409> pop<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.829> out

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
reef from the cable here and pop it out

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.729 
reef from the cable here and pop it out
and<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.250> cable<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.700> range<00:03:06.439> it's<00:03:07.439> just<00:03:07.650> a

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and put the cable on range it's just a

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.199 
and put the cable on range it's just a
little<00:03:07.860> clamp<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.459> caps<00:03:08.700> down<00:03:08.909> on<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> cable

to make sure it doesn't pull out of the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:25.220 
to make sure it doesn't pull out of the
plug

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.790 

so<00:03:25.800> now<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.129> bend<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.459> wires<00:03:26.700> around<00:03:27.800> so

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
so now we can bend the wires around so

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.390 
so now we can bend the wires around so
they<00:03:29.010> all<00:03:29.099> fit<00:03:29.480> nice<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.690> easily<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:32.069> then

they all fit nice and easily and then

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.059 
they all fit nice and easily and then
tighten<00:03:32.790> down<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.970> clamp<00:03:33.300> on<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.540> cable

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.100 

that's<00:03:41.819> always<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.150> good<00:03:42.299> idea<00:03:42.330> today<00:03:42.750> can<00:03:42.989> take

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
that's always a good idea today can take

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.559 
that's always a good idea today can take
a<00:03:43.140> last<00:03:43.349> look<00:03:43.500> at<00:03:43.680> your<00:03:43.739> plug<00:03:44.360> shirt<00:03:45.360> your

a last look at your plug shirt your

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.199 
a last look at your plug shirt your
three<00:03:45.780> wires<00:03:45.989> are<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.290> correct<00:03:46.500> places

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
three wires are in the correct places

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:56.330 
three wires are in the correct places
then<00:03:48.209> fine<00:03:48.480> we'll<00:03:48.510> tighten<00:03:48.840> them<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:55.189> pop<00:03:56.189> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.160 

that's<00:04:04.769> how<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:04.980> wire<00:04:05.189> plug<00:04:05.719> takes<00:04:06.719> about<00:04:06.900> two

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
that's how you wire plug takes about two

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.310 
that's how you wire plug takes about two
minutes<00:04:07.379> and<00:04:07.620> anybody<00:04:07.950> can<00:04:08.129> do<00:04:08.280> it
