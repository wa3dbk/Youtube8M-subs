00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 is none other than lay 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.650
 because because the current one is not going to be 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.800
 secular 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 when friends of the model I shared 5 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.860
 Today I bring you the method to have the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.940
 unlimited energy 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.470
 if you can say 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.380
 since we do not owe 215 on the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.840
 ships the packages asking and 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.030
 how can I have this user 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.280
 advanced the veteran user account 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.399
 veteran 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.970
 and then there really is no way yet 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:56.060
 that the people that after the last tape 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.829
 this release does not play there is no way to 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.380
 that cost in a veteran account 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.390
 but 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.920
 because thanks to this application they can 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.920
 have unlimited energy 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.180
 good this application is to explain it 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.860
 I will explain how it works 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.080
 and I'll leave them in the description 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.850
 of the video totally free 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.950
 Well the first thing they will do good 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.820
 this application is that nothing military the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.130
 root user and they are super users 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.860
 because if you're not, then you're not going to 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.660
 function 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.550
 The first thing they have to do is open 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.550
 the one that has it installed 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.909
 This is going to load and everything just taught us 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.990
 that open the application here is not only 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.990
 that they open it to give them 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.340
 and you accept 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.679
 with what I bring you together 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.799
 this claudia once you open it will load 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.799
 and this time this well-being is going to change 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.790
 in this good thing to do it is what 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.110
 have to do since I charge do what 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.790
 worse is that you talk is going to leave 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.790
 this is loading 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.650
 this 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.520
 since this is loaded like this is going to be the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.959
 first time this is going to change this is what 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.270
 what you have to do is change it because 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.220
 if you do not change it 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.950
 and they go to prehistory and download 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.100
 something or just with entering the play 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.760
 store 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.020
 they will grow and they will not leave 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.610
 open it plextor for nothing of an error 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.319
 so there are a lot of people who do not know 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.859
 occupy it 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.840
 and that's why it 's the scratch no longer 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.840
 So that's why I put them before d 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.150
 I installed it not 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.120
 just simply with installing it and 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.960
 accept the root user who accept the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.770
 services this would be all good now 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.319
 I'm going to enter the games so they can see 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.860
 how is that it gives me unlimited energy 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.590
 that's why I had to make an account 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.770
 for energy and how they realize 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.770
 here 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.430
 it comes out empty 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.380
 0 10/0 hours I do not know what we are in 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.810
 the Polish chat 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.810
 we see is Polish but we 're going 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.819
 before a game to be left that I do not 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.840
 remove or tell me what error for not having 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.459
 hand 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.670
 she with this that was the energy 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.670
 unlimited 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.030
 do not worry 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.060
 good taking advantage of this time I'm going to 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.300
 send greetings to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.090
 is calling 10 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.090
 and for those who do not know good health 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.390
 I send greetings to my children 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.390
 to miguelito ronaldo 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.360
 diego ramírez gonzález 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.359
 already of 2k hands in bone health and in 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.850
 facebook page of woman as five 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:24.250
 which is then to leave in the description 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.250
 and good this video this 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.870
 and what a friend had uploaded before 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.320
 it's called mafia gameplays and videos from 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.690
 this game 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.520
 then this because I told him I was going 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.000
 I was going to upload I had planned to upload it 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.510
 but he won 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.760
 but he also has it and well if 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.500
 they want to check this 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.890
 the video is left in the description 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.910
 so that if I did not lie a new better and 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.910
 they understand it better 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.810
 in this part I am testing for what 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.620
 that does not take away energy 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.539
 in the hill they realize not even 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.539
 rodong missiles i have no energy 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.029
 I will wait for 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.029
 I killed someone 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.030
 4 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.509
 and I 'm going to leave 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.190
 in case people noticed that it was in another 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.940
 language 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.940
 because 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.220
 the squads that those who do not 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.480
 we know in our community 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.980
 that I will leave in the description 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.849
 of the video where he explained 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.089
 well 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.309
 we put all the Polish lyricism for 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.580
 find us in the global and at the time of 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:04.000
 to play 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.610
 Squad battle or squad stoppage 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.110
 so let's meet and it will be the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.240
 interesting games the battles 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.210
 and one thing in mind then here 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.860
 you do not change anything you can play a 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.960
 game and I think that 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.199
 for those who play with energy 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.770
 removes two per game all strips 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.770
 because nothing happens here 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.010
 and well they can not see 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.010
 It is not personal then 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.430
 Well I would like that in the description 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.449
 of the video in the comments they told me 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.789
 whether it served them or not served them 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.600
 and well I will be answering your 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.750
 comments 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.810
 and try to help them ok 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:58.100
 and good if you liked this video I hope and 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:00.020
 they leave you like a little hand up and you 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.590
 subscribe we are worth when we are
