00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.080
 Today I want to explain side swimming 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.380
 First we have to look at the scissors feet 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.160
 Then the hand movement 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.580
 Then how to combine the scissors feet with the hand movements 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.080
 Finally, I will see the side swimming and the reverse scissors feet. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.500
 The starting action of the side swimming is lying on the side 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 Side swimming is the use of scissors feet 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 The scissor foot is bent backwards from the foot above the foot 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.620
 Then both feet are straight and clipped 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.280
 Let's take a look at the effect in the water 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.360
 Like the water in the film 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 Side stroke hand movement 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.740
 Hand movements can help you move forward 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 The hand near the head 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 Bending and then stretching forward can help us move forward 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.440
 Stretch one hand forward and dial back 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.400
 When the hand near the head is to be stretched forward, the upper foot is bent at the same time 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.560
 The movement of the hands and feet simultaneously shrinks and stretches at the same time 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 This is the overall action when in the water 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.660
 It takes a full stretch to help the taxi 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.040
 When using a trans-screw foot, the movement of the upper and lower feet 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.220
 The upper foot is clipped from the back to the front 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.240
 The following feet are taken from the back clip 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
 The hand movements are the same as the feet. 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.760
 The trans-scissors are very practical when saving people. 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.060
 The reason is that the trans-screw feet will not kick the people we want to rescue.
