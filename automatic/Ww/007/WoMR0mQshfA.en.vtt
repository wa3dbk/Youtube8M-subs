for<00:02:35.650> insects<00:02:36.099> as<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.180> turns<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:37.930> over<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
for insects as it turns out all over the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.309 
for insects as it turns out all over the
world<00:02:38.800> are<00:02:39.040> thriving<00:02:39.550> markets<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:40.630> locally

world are thriving markets for locally
appropriate<00:02:41.849> insects<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.160> poses<00:02:45.459> a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
appropriate insects so this poses a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.780 
appropriate insects so this poses a
paradoxical<00:02:46.480> question<00:02:47.080> if<00:02:47.319> insects<00:02:48.280> are<00:02:48.489> such

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
paradoxical question if insects are such

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.059 
paradoxical question if insects are such
a<00:02:48.819> power<00:02:49.180> food<00:02:49.660> they're<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.290> good<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.620> you

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
a power food they're so good for you

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.339 
a power food they're so good for you
people<00:02:51.760> like<00:02:52.030> them<00:02:52.330> people<00:02:52.660> are<00:02:52.900> willing<00:02:53.319> to

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
people like them people are willing to

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.309 
people like them people are willing to
pay<00:02:53.709> for<00:02:53.980> them<00:02:54.069> then<00:02:54.940> why<00:02:55.299> is<00:02:55.360> there<00:02:55.959> food

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
pay for them then why is there food

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.809 
pay for them then why is there food
insecurity<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.430> urban<00:02:57.910> slums<00:02:59.190> the<00:03:00.190> answer<00:03:00.640> is

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
insecurity in urban slums the answer is

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.720 
insecurity in urban slums the answer is
twofold<00:03:01.269> one<00:03:02.140> their<00:03:02.680> seasonal<00:03:03.220> which<00:03:03.430> means

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
twofold one their seasonal which means

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.610 
twofold one their seasonal which means
that<00:03:03.880> they're<00:03:04.030> only<00:03:04.180> available<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.319> few

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
that they're only available for a few

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.309 
that they're only available for a few
months<00:03:05.920> out<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.280> year<00:03:06.840> second<00:03:07.840> when<00:03:08.200> they

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
months out of the year second when they

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.390 
months out of the year second when they
are<00:03:08.560> available

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
are available

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.120 
are available
they're<00:03:09.959> painstakingly<00:03:10.959> hand<00:03:11.410> harvested

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
they're painstakingly hand harvested

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.420 
they're painstakingly hand harvested
which<00:03:12.580> makes<00:03:12.880> them<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.390> expensive<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:15.160> our

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
which makes them really expensive so our

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.330 
which makes them really expensive so our
solution<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:16.920> seasonal<00:03:17.920> and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
solution is to take seasonal and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.680 
solution is to take seasonal and
harvesting<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.360> insects<00:03:19.900> two<00:03:20.650> year-long

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
harvesting of insects two year-long

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.890 
harvesting of insects two year-long
sustainable<00:03:22.690> farming<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.440> insects<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:25.660> plan

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
sustainable farming of insects we plan

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.830 
sustainable farming of insects we plan
to<00:03:26.110> do<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.620> three<00:03:27.010> ways<00:03:27.280> first<00:03:28.120> empower

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
to do this in three ways first empower

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.640 
to do this in three ways first empower
farmers<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:30.010> grow<00:03:30.280> their<00:03:30.489> own<00:03:30.519> insects<00:03:31.390> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
farmers to grow their own insects and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.020 
farmers to grow their own insects and
transport<00:03:32.650> them<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:33.100> local<00:03:33.430> hub<00:03:33.790> which

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
transport them to a local hub which

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.630 
transport them to a local hub which
allows<00:03:34.600> us<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.200> bring<00:03:35.440> in<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.799> lot<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.220> supply

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
allows us to bring in a lot of supply

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.410 
allows us to bring in a lot of supply
together<00:03:37.269> at<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.530> hub<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:39.100> can<00:03:39.519> also<00:03:40.090> breed

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
together at the hub you can also breed

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.990 
together at the hub you can also breed
your<00:03:40.630> own<00:03:40.780> insects<00:03:41.530> process<00:03:42.459> them<00:03:42.700> lightly

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
your own insects process them lightly

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.819 
your own insects process them lightly
and<00:03:43.510> distribute<00:03:44.410> them<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.859> slum<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:47.560> order

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
and distribute them to the slum in order

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.410 
and distribute them to the slum in order
to<00:03:47.980> make<00:03:48.160> sure<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.489> would<00:03:48.640> be<00:03:48.790> really<00:03:49.180> work

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
to make sure this would be really work

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.210 
to make sure this would be really work
we<00:03:49.660> first<00:03:49.989> went<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.380> Thailand<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.130> in

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
we first went to Thailand and in

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.360 
we first went to Thailand and in
Thailand<00:03:51.700> we<00:03:51.880> observed<00:03:52.329> very<00:03:52.660> simple<00:03:53.560> cricket

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
Thailand we observed very simple cricket

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.640 
Thailand we observed very simple cricket
farming<00:03:54.760> practices<00:03:55.359> we<00:03:55.989> then<00:03:56.200> took<00:03:56.440> those

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
farming practices we then took those

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.890 
farming practices we then took those
farming<00:03:57.100> practices<00:03:57.670> made<00:03:58.120> them<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.359> bit<00:03:58.660> more

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
farming practices made them a bit more

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.530 
farming practices made them a bit more
effective<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.739> started<00:04:00.370> our<00:04:00.670> production

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
effective and started our production

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.710 
effective and started our production
pilot<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:02.139> Kenya<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.700> our<00:04:03.880> solution<00:04:04.389> is<00:04:04.510> really

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
pilot in Kenya so our solution is really

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.199 
pilot in Kenya so our solution is really
about<00:04:05.049> taking<00:04:05.560> existing<00:04:05.980> farming<00:04:06.670> practices

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
about taking existing farming practices

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.930 
about taking existing farming practices
and<00:04:07.420> making<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.900> most<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.680> most<00:04:09.400> effective

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
and making the most the most effective

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.479 
and making the most the most effective
possible<00:04:10.150> all<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.019> while<00:04:11.530> training<00:04:12.100> people

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
possible all the while training people

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.819 
possible all the while training people
and<00:04:12.850> empowering<00:04:13.359> people<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:14.200> able<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.470> grow

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
and empowering people to be able to grow

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.969 
and empowering people to be able to grow
them<00:04:15.040> themselves<00:04:15.959> in<00:04:16.959> order<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.470> see<00:04:17.680> how<00:04:17.709> this

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
them themselves in order to see how this

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.180 
them themselves in order to see how this
works<00:04:18.280> let<00:04:18.910> me<00:04:18.940> take<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.570> Mexico<00:04:20.100> let<00:04:21.100> me

largest slum home to 4 million people

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.490 
largest slum home to 4 million people
with<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:29.080> 38%<00:04:29.979> anemia<00:04:30.700> rate<00:04:31.000> where<00:04:31.450> 40%<00:04:32.380> of

children are undernourished

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.210 
children are undernourished
so<00:04:36.540> how<00:04:36.690> would<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:36.990> work<00:04:37.050> into<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.620> NASA<00:04:37.890> Hall

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
so how would this work into it NASA Hall

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.790 
so how would this work into it NASA Hall
Cola<00:04:38.700> well<00:04:39.000> outside<00:04:39.480> of<00:04:39.660> NASA<00:04:39.810> hulla<00:04:40.500> which<00:04:40.650> is

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
Cola well outside of NASA hulla which is

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.060 
Cola well outside of NASA hulla which is
near<00:04:40.950> Mexico<00:04:41.490> City<00:04:41.760> we<00:04:42.630> would<00:04:42.900> have<00:04:43.410> farmers

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
near Mexico City we would have farmers

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.460 
near Mexico City we would have farmers
who<00:04:44.370> would<00:04:44.550> grow<00:04:44.820> their<00:04:45.150> own<00:04:45.180> insect<00:04:45.900> chapels

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
who would grow their own insect chapels

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.500 
who would grow their own insect chapels
enos<00:04:46.770> or<00:04:46.980> grasshoppers<00:04:47.220> as<00:04:47.820> are<00:04:48.000> called<00:04:48.210> there

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
enos or grasshoppers as are called there

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.830 
enos or grasshoppers as are called there
and<00:04:49.220> they<00:04:50.220> would<00:04:50.460> grow<00:04:50.880> them<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.420> then

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
and they would grow them and then

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.280 
and they would grow them and then
transport<00:04:52.560> them<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.220> hub<00:04:53.810> at<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.870> hub
