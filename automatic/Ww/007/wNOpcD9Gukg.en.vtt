00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.830
 Welcome to one more kitchen of the moon. 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.109
 today I will teach you one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 a recipe that is easy not only for 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.020
 amount of ingredients it is a goal 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.310
 homemade 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.830
 you will need the following 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.010
 ingredients ground meat and pepperoni 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 chopped onion chopped cheese I chose 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.269
 emmental cheese that I for me is more 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.850
 tasty tomato and hamburger bread 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.969
 lettuce for you do not pass the after 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.730
 mayonnaise and shown to make the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.590
 mustard and honey sauce and tastes - august 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.250
 and to make a book you will dirty the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.520
 hands 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 so do not forget to give up 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.809
 all the frills of your life because 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 You'll have more on a raw meat. 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.340
 mix I see now then to start 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.820
 You will put the ground beef onion 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 I'm not going to put all this show and workman 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 chopped to give a little more time 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 Our fight, but as you will not know 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.689
 with you can add b components if 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.360
 I want it but I think everything it takes 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.119
 fried bacon taste and similar then 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.970
 you like bacon background will boot but 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.369
 I do not think I need this here is the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.380
 pepper and cumin and this one is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.290
 a thick salt is actually salt flower 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 which is the salt that is stronger than 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.579
 the same salt even it still has a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.270
 pepper in the middle then gives a taste 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.060
 different than lan mixing and staying here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.540
 in this land had the direction and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.540
 beef 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.020
 Now to make the burger format 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.430
 you can just pick up a little 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.930
 by hand and kneading 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.790
 I have here a tool that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.119
 It facilitates the work you put some 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.970
 within this circle and the mass 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.810
 he will see the 1 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.759
 jean has a very fatty bug and so 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 you will do several including storage 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.200
 them in that format and then when you 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.270
 need to be ready in the format 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.160
 You want you can do the size you want 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.840
 You also prefer a more 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.790
 more skinny chubby and now we 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.769
 will slice the cheese if you do not 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.510
 bought and sliced â€‹â€‹and then fried 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.580
 hamburger of course is more practical 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.030
 you buy what you already sliced 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.299
 but life is something else and I do not 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.220
 I found the mental qg already thiago can 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.380
 take in the paddock send it to them 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 announce but when you make slices 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.519
 so you can make a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.010
 The highest layer of cheese not only places 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:47.610
 a slice or two you can put several 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.830
 it will become more complicated so I think 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.299
 we fry a bug also has a 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.130
 sauce that you will put you can 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.260
 put barbecue sauce can put the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.150
 mayonnaise but I'll do it now show 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.980
 of honey to make and I forgot you 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 one of the ingredients that modify 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.459
 fresh 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.890
 so we're going to mix three parts 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.320
 of mayonnaise to where honey is plus 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.320
 little mayonnaise then show 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.090
 of guilt and this is doing the way that 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:18.380
 going to the doctor is not a 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.380
 exact science 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.950
 I recommend basil leaves 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.950
 chopped light fresh neat 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.579
 that way of mustard and honey that goes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.780
 put on your burger 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.939
 then when you set up a 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.230
 sandwich to apply a goal that the 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:53.739
 people put a little oil on the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.739
 frying pan hopes to warm up and goes in faith 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.359
 It's good that the volume is too loud for 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.359
 You do not burn and you do not get inside. 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.790
 I think it 's ready 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.340
 I already counted the goal in half we'll put 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:26.410
 the most beautiful thing about God and hamburger 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.410
 now cheeses butter cheese 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.900
 Look, I lose peace to the fast nets. 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.819
 food knows that it follows very well this 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.710
 hamburg and also another video I said 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.789
 about the lens which is a great 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.800
 side dish 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.909
 Let's ask when to see if with a 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.669
 dry 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:05:05.680
 I know bb waits for the hour of truth. 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:07.629
 in our kitchen from the inside but you 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.460
 Like last May you can leave one 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:18.340
 little more rose is better 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.229
 combines with 15 works 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.469
