00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Today I want to show you how easy 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 the coffee preparation or the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.139
 coffee specialties prepared with the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:16.770
 de'longhi primadonna it works as 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.960
 Next we make the cappuccino here 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.100
 Of course, the milk is on spout 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.900
 far above 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.220
 there it is practically you can do this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.080
 just pull down 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.700
 Continue to the coffee outlet 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 also move down 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 then we can again with the one-handed 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.309
 operation or 1 button operation the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.309
 to prepare coffee cappuccino 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.719
 on the display 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.460
 By the way, how far do you see? 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.460
 progress in preparation 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.799
 A cappuccino should be very normal 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.159
 creamy and watch me be that 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.549
 I do not like the milk here 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.850
 set container like I look at the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.619
 Milk should be from 1 to hot milk 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.350
 which I do not necessarily recommend 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.740
 for the cappuccino over two normal 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.450
 creamy or three very creamy what I'm in 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.450
 have used the case here now
