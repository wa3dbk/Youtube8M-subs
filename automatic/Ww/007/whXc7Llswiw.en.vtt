00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
nice enough I'll follow my game is to a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.819 
nice enough I'll follow my game is to a
used<00:01:04.030> tissue<00:01:04.210> surface<00:01:04.900> area<00:01:05.170> grab<00:01:05.530> him

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
used tissue surface area grab him

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.310 
used tissue surface area grab him
releasing<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.820> city's<00:01:07.119> way<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.329> catch<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.900> wild

releasing the city's way to catch a wild

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.100 
releasing the city's way to catch a wild
be<00:01:08.590> like<00:01:08.770> this<00:01:08.950> wired<00:01:09.549> up<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.990> use<00:01:11.079> a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
be like this wired up not to use a

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.140 
be like this wired up not to use a
tissue<00:01:11.350> in<00:01:11.590> grab<00:01:11.799> him<00:01:11.950> he<00:01:12.310> just<00:01:12.460> too<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.939> too

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
tissue in grab him he just too is too

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.649 
tissue in grab him he just too is too
active

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
active

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.190 
active
so<00:01:14.560> basically<00:01:14.799> scribe<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:15.310> tissue<00:01:16.079> wadded<00:01:17.079> up

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
so basically scribe up tissue wadded up

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.230 
so basically scribe up tissue wadded up
to<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.950> surface<00:01:18.189> area<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.909> you're

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
to a surface area so that you're

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240 
to a surface area so that you're
separating<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:19.840> if<00:01:19.930> imp<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.259> stung<00:01:20.530> by

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
separating it so if imp is stung by

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.350 
separating it so if imp is stung by
stinging<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.729> it's<00:01:21.939> not<00:01:22.000> going<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.240> get

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
stinging you it's not going to get

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.450 
stinging you it's not going to get
through<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.960> know<00:01:23.049> inch<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.560> tissue<00:01:24.370> paper

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
through you know inch of tissue paper

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.670 
through you know inch of tissue paper
and<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.030> can<00:01:25.120> all<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.810> surface<00:01:26.050> area<00:01:26.140> grabs

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
and you can all the surface area grabs

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.980 
and you can all the surface area grabs
and<00:01:26.950> holds<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.340> place<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:27.840> we're<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:28.930> to

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
and holds it in place so we're going to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.890 
and holds it in place so we're going to
do<00:01:29.140> here<00:01:29.290> hi<00:01:29.890> Shasta<00:01:30.630> right

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
surface area and then just simple as

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.200 
surface area and then just simple as
that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210
