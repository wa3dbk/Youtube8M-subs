need more places the 12 is always help
with<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:58.139> double<00:00:59.139> screen<00:01:00.539> checker<00:01:01.539> or

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
with the double screen checker or

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.700 
with the double screen checker or

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.900 
goal of the things is going very weird
oh<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.590> all<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:13.150> multi<00:01:13.540> monitors<00:01:13.960> are

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
oh so all the multi monitors are

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.410 
oh so all the multi monitors are
doubled<00:01:15.910> by<00:01:16.090> two<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.580> have<00:01:19.090> two

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
doubled by two so if we have two

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.210 
doubled by two so if we have two
monitors<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:22.170> desktop<00:01:23.170> change<00:01:23.530> or<00:01:23.770> button<00:01:24.130> is

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
company is an elite these statistics us

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.580 
company is an elite these statistics us
just<00:04:51.000> looks<00:04:51.240> like<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.510> same<00:04:51.900> but<00:04:52.230> this<00:04:52.920> didn't

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
just looks like a same but this didn't

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.860 
just looks like a same but this didn't
because<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:55.770> one<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.250> income<00:04:56.850> graph<00:04:57.150> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
because this one is income graph the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.240 
because this one is income graph the
second<00:04:58.230> one<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.410> operating<00:04:59.220> profit<00:04:59.700> graph<00:05:00.200> so

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
second one is operating profit graph so

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.780 
second one is operating profit graph so
maybe<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.520> graph<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.630> be<00:05:03.750> different

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
maybe this graph is can be different

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.140 
maybe this graph is can be different
okay<00:05:05.790> let's<00:05:06.330> see<00:05:06.540> authors<00:05:07.790> how<00:05:08.790> much<00:05:08.970> money

have only remaining 11 it or two to get

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.890 
have only remaining 11 it or two to get
to<00:05:23.340> work<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:25.250> this<00:05:26.250> is<00:05:26.460> not<00:05:26.610> looks<00:05:27.180> like<00:05:27.480> easy

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
to work so this is not looks like easy

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.680 
to work so this is not looks like easy
but<00:05:28.350> in<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.920> way<00:05:29.160> come<00:05:30.060> on<00:05:30.180> is<00:05:30.330> much<00:05:30.510> more

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
but in this way come on is much more

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.310 
but in this way come on is much more
