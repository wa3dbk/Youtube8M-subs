00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
just for the xbox yeah it is I hope but

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.449 
just for the xbox yeah it is I hope but
that's<00:03:49.349> what<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:49.560> saying<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.159> a<00:03:50.189> ten

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
that's what I'm saying it's like a ten

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.879 
that's what I'm saying it's like a ten
dollar<00:03:50.609> hey<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:51.870> not<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.109> same<00:03:52.290> thing<00:03:52.319> yeah

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889
