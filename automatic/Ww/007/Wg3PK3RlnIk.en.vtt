00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
help to do it quickly so that that dough

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.280 
help to do it quickly so that that dough
does<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.220> warm<00:01:53.610> back<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.840> using<00:01:55.200> a

Fahrenheit<00:02:38.770> for<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:39.520> eight<00:02:39.820> minutes<00:02:40.180> now<00:02:40.810> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
Fahrenheit for just eight minutes now I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.540 
Fahrenheit for just eight minutes now I
say<00:02:41.110> just<00:02:41.380> eight<00:02:41.560> minutes<00:02:41.739> because<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:42.340> do

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
say just eight minutes because we do

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.340 
say just eight minutes because we do
want<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.850> preserve<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.510> chewiness<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.870 
want to preserve the chewiness of the
cookie<00:02:44.650> because<00:02:45.100> we<00:02:45.220> are<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.790> be

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
cookie because we are going to be

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.580 
cookie because we are going to be
freezing<00:02:46.390> these<00:02:46.540> sandwiches<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.230> if<00:02:47.440> they're

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
freezing these sandwiches and if they're

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.080 
freezing these sandwiches and if they're
too<00:02:47.769> crisp<00:02:48.070> they'll<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.459> kind<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.700> crumble

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
too crisp they'll just kind of crumble

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.580 
too crisp they'll just kind of crumble
so<00:02:49.360> eight<00:02:49.690> minutes<00:02:50.110> they're<00:02:50.290> good<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.560> go

set up a little bit more just from that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.420 
set up a little bit more just from that
remaining<00:03:09.489> heat<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.360> baking<00:03:10.630> pipe<00:03:11.430> okay

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
remaining heat of the baking pipe okay

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.100 
remaining heat of the baking pipe okay
so<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:13.000> comes<00:03:13.030> our<00:03:13.360> little<00:03:13.390> cheat<00:03:13.840> for

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
so here comes our little cheat for

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.080 
so here comes our little cheat for
homemade<00:03:14.380> ice<00:03:14.590> cream<00:03:14.620> without<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.220> machine<00:03:15.430> we

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
homemade ice cream without a machine we

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.880 
homemade ice cream without a machine we
are<00:03:16.209> basically<00:03:16.570> just<00:03:16.720> going<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.260> prepare<00:03:17.650> a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
are basically just going to prepare a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.949 
are basically just going to prepare a
heavy<00:03:18.280> cream<00:03:18.640> mixture<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.299> we<00:03:19.480> are<00:03:19.600> going<00:03:19.810> to

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
heavy cream mixture that we are going to

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.020 
heavy cream mixture that we are going to
freeze<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.829> when<00:03:20.950> we<00:03:21.070> do<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.579> is<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.880> to

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
freeze but when we do it is going to

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.880 
freeze but when we do it is going to
create<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.570> similar<00:03:23.049> texture<00:03:23.530> so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
create that similar texture so

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.860 
create that similar texture so
associated<00:03:24.220> with<00:03:24.579> that<00:03:24.820> saucer<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.420> style<00:03:25.690> of

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
associated with that saucer of style of

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.039 
associated with that saucer of style of
ice<00:03:25.989> cream<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:27.940> an<00:03:28.030> electric<00:03:28.420> mixer<00:03:28.570> you're

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
ice cream so in an electric mixer you're

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.650 
ice cream so in an electric mixer you're
going<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.350> add<00:03:29.470> two<00:03:30.250> cups<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.640> heavy<00:03:30.970> cream<00:03:31.120> and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
going to add two cups of heavy cream and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.750 
going to add two cups of heavy cream and
then<00:03:31.829> we're<00:03:32.829> going<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:32.980> use<00:03:33.040> two<00:03:33.370> types<00:03:33.549> of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
then we're going to use two types of

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.250 
then we're going to use two types of
sugars<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.630> reason<00:03:34.870> we're<00:03:34.959> going<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.110> do

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
sugars and the reason we're going to do

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.569 
sugars and the reason we're going to do
that<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.620> they<00:03:35.769> each<00:03:35.950> will<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.340> something

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
that is they each will do something

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:37.199 
that is they each will do something
different

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
different

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.060 
different
so<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.510> want<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.810> use<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.079> half<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.500> cup<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.890> just

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
so you want to use a half a cup of just

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.310 
so you want to use a half a cup of just
plain<00:03:39.370> white<00:03:39.820> sugar<00:03:40.180> now<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:40.930> is<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.140> most

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
plain white sugar now this is the most

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.289 
plain white sugar now this is the most
refined<00:03:41.769> processed<00:03:42.130> sugar<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.090> and

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
refined processed sugar you can get and

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.940 
refined processed sugar you can get and
the<00:03:43.420> reason<00:03:43.450> why<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:44.019> want<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.380> for<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.739> is

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
the reason why we want it for this is

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.009 
the reason why we want it for this is
it's<00:03:45.310> going<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.700> give<00:03:45.910> our<00:03:46.150> ice<00:03:46.329> cream<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.750> nice

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
it's going to give our ice cream a nice

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.289 
it's going to give our ice cream a nice
smooth<00:03:47.620> texture<00:03:48.220> I've<00:03:48.700> ever<00:03:48.850> tried<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.150> make

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
smooth texture I've ever tried to make

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.610 
smooth texture I've ever tried to make
homemade<00:03:49.600> ice<00:03:49.750> cream<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.380> kind<00:03:50.530> of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
homemade ice cream and it's kind of

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.650 
homemade ice cream and it's kind of
crystallized<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.340> icy<00:03:51.760> usually<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.510> means

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
crystallized and icy usually it means

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.030 
crystallized and icy usually it means
there's<00:03:52.810> not<00:03:52.930> enough<00:03:52.989> sugar<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.860> sugar

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
there's not enough sugar so the sugar

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.220 
there's not enough sugar so the sugar
really<00:03:54.340> helps<00:03:54.730> with<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:54.970> texture<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.660> then

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
really helps with the texture and then

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.840 
really helps with the texture and then
we're<00:03:56.320> also<00:03:56.440> going<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.650> use<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:57.130> quarter<00:03:57.610> cup<00:03:57.820> of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
we're also going to use a quarter cup of

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.060 
we're also going to use a quarter cup of
powdered<00:03:58.540> sugar<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.079> powdered<00:03:59.620> sugar<00:03:59.890> is

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
powdered sugar so powdered sugar is

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.340 
powdered sugar so powdered sugar is
really<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.700> finally<00:04:01.269> processed<00:04:01.750> sugar<00:04:02.049> with

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
really just finally processed sugar with

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.229 
really just finally processed sugar with
a<00:04:02.380> little<00:04:02.680> bit<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.799> cornstarch<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.090> we

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
a little bit of cornstarch in it and we

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.789 
a little bit of cornstarch in it and we
want<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.630> cornstarch<00:04:05.079> because<00:04:05.320> that<00:04:05.650> is

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
want the cornstarch because that is

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.009 
want the cornstarch because that is
going<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.130> give<00:04:06.280> us<00:04:06.430> great<00:04:06.579> stabilization<00:04:07.540> for

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
going to give us great stabilization for

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.690 
going to give us great stabilization for
this<00:04:08.170> cream<00:04:08.440> which<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:08.859> going<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.190> help<00:04:09.430> when

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
this cream which is going to help when

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.660 
this cream which is going to help when
we<00:04:09.790> go<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.000> pipe<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.359> out

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
we go to pipe it out

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.580 
we go to pipe it out
and<00:04:10.790> then<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.600> flavor<00:04:11.870> our<00:04:12.080> cream<00:04:12.319> we're<00:04:12.560> going

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and then to flavor our cream we're going

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.710 
and then to flavor our cream we're going
to<00:04:12.830> add<00:04:13.010> two<00:04:13.460> tablespoons<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:14.270> vanilla

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
to add two tablespoons of vanilla

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.310 
to add two tablespoons of vanilla
extract<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:17.209> are<00:04:17.359> going<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.660> beat<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:17.930> up

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
extract so we are going to beat that up

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.250 
extract so we are going to beat that up
until<00:04:18.560> very<00:04:18.739> stiff<00:04:19.549> peaks<00:04:20.150> formed<00:04:20.750> then<00:04:21.140> once

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
until very stiff peaks formed then once

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.900 
until very stiff peaks formed then once
your<00:04:21.380> cream<00:04:21.530> is<00:04:21.560> ready<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.980> go<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.430> want<00:04:22.850> to

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
your cream is ready to go you want to

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.490 
your cream is ready to go you want to
take<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.120> pastry<00:04:23.360> bag<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.960> fit<00:04:24.230> it<00:04:24.350> with<00:04:24.470> a

large star tip transfer the cream into
the<00:04:28.160> pastry<00:04:28.430> bag<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:30.020> then<00:04:30.320> making<00:04:30.470> sure<00:04:30.710> that

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
the pastry bag and then making sure that

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.530 
the pastry bag and then making sure that
those<00:04:30.950> cookies<00:04:31.310> are<00:04:31.340> nice<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.790> cool<00:04:32.000> you're

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
those cookies are nice and cool you're

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.930 
those cookies are nice and cool you're
going<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.810> flip<00:04:33.080> them<00:04:33.230> over<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:34.430> their<00:04:34.730> backs

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
going to flip them over on their backs

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.600 
going to flip them over on their backs
and<00:04:35.320> then<00:04:36.320> you're<00:04:36.410> going<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.620> pipe<00:04:36.980> some<00:04:37.010> cream

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and then you're going to pipe some cream

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.450 
and then you're going to pipe some cream
just<00:04:38.240> on<00:04:38.480> half<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.990> them<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:40.250> way<00:04:40.400> you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
just on half of them and the way you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.740
