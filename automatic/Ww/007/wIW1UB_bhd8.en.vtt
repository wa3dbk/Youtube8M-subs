00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.920
 and we're going to make a dough that we already have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.260
 a video made but it's a little different 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.030
 that's why we want to repeat it is a mass 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.630
 that we are going to use to model 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 different things call it erekat rice 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 krispies street because the basis of this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.150
 mass are the inflated rice the krispies 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 hence the name well then to make it 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 we have already seen we need 30 grams of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.460
 butter 160 grams of mars fellows 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.180
 marshmallow clouds as you want mormons or 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.370
 be a bag no matter what they are 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.620
 I like to use anybody but 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 you can use the little white ones 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.450
 phenomenal that you see I am using roses 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.430
 and it will give equal in the final result 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.920
 well put a little butter the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.210
 more bad and another bit of butter and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.210
 we are going to put it to fire 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.329
 one of the tricks is that you have to do it 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.649
 very slowly, I'm setting 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.059
 some fat in the spoon so that 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.059
 it did not hit rotate as much 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.640
 as I said you have to do it slowly I 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.290
 mean the fire is slow let 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.920
 To take longer but they will stay longer 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.530
 uniforms the baddest are the clouds are 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.630
 they melt and they stay like 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.250
 a masita until that mass is not 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.500
 is soup is to say that they have melted 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.510
 all of them we will not incorporate the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.510
 krispies 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.760
 You see it's almost dissolved in some 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.040
 small rivers then when it is at all 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.910
 we incorporate all the krispies and 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.910
 we put everything together 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.370
 once we have them together well what 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.640
 What we do is remove it from the fire 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.170
 and let it cool is convenient 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.209
 pasta is good for many things you'll see 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.360
 that we are not going to use in many videos is 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.520
 convenient that we leave a little 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.050
 rest before you start to peel 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.310
 another thing that is going to say good the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.470
 first video that we have done with this 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.720
 recipe is what we have made of the cake 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.510
 of the ego 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.520
 and we're going to put it like this we've done it 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.880
 for that video some images of how it 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.980
 would we work on that video the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.390
 we use to make a motorcycle and what 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.400
 we do is put a kitchen paper 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.680
 on top of a pattern that we have as 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.470
 let's say the plant of the motorcycle and what 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.520
 we do is put our hands together with fat 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.810
 because the crises are very sticky 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.830
 then we get together with fat and already 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.600
 we can work with them 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.120
 we are calmly taking 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.580
 piles and putting on top of our 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.320
 pattern we have also made a wheel 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.930
 for the same bike that does not need 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.700
 patterns or just make a round 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.050
 you will see what we are going to do or if all 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.830
 We are going to do many things and not 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.900
 you need at all good pattern but 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.560
 in this case yes and we are going to see 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.410
 the krispies in the pattern squeezing the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.380
 strong when more squeeze are more 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.560
 durable and more compact which will 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.560
 let's do 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.860
 and little by little we will model the piece 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.020
 what we want and see if it is a 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.670
 piece that has edges about what weapon 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.280
 it is flat because we can help with a 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.760
 spatula to go giving it that way that 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.760
 we want 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.710
 in any case once you have it 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.090
 done and you had already come back to 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.409
 tighten after half an hour 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.619
 you will still see that it can compact I know 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.749
 Well, the fact is that we leave then 

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:39.269
 that rests like 34 hours or a day 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:42.059
 for another better say we did a wheel 

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:45.749
 and the part of the bike and now we have 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:48.419
 to finish shaping the deforma 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:50.009
 we use a saw knife there 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.689
 I feel we are going to remove a piece that does not 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.719
 we need but it is that to have done it 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.899
 with that raised it would have been too much 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:05:00.149
 well then another issue that needs to be fixed 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:03.689
 is that the puffed rice looks like 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:05.039
 a texture not suitable and suitable but we are going to 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:07.739
 the lid do not confuse it because it 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:12.229
 it would be like the granulate then for 

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:12.229
 do that there are also several techniques 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.360
 The first is to use a grater as the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.919
 cheese radiators we could use a 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.400
 finite sandpaper but I do not like to use 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.870
 sandpapers on feed stuff then 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.719
 I prefer to use a cheese grater 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.550
 go filing you see the structure the 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.069
 next is what we are doing 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.139
 here is to apply something over because as 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.699
 the structure is a bit weak if 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.800
 We put to use the grater we can 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.810
 break it here we are applying the 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.610
 Chocolate in chocolate substitute for 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.460
 cover those holes but you could have 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.409
 also put butter cream or 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.949
 anything else and already from there 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.949
 to cover 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.709
 we cover with fondant as if 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.659
 we were covering a normal sponge cake 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:56.039
 if it had dried up a lot 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.839
 a lot of chocolate because we would have to 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.849
 have put something sticky to be able to 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.129
 put the fondant in conditions if the 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.870
 Fondant layer overflowing is not necessary 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:08.110
 nor filing the christie 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.270
 and well, if you like the video read me 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.860
 like and wait to see how many things 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.860
 let's do with the recate
