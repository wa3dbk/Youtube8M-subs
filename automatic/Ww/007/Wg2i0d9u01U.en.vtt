00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the track comes down like this this part

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970 
the track comes down like this this part
of<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> track<00:00:21.720> where<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> comes<00:00:22.590> down<00:00:22.740> you'll

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
of the track where it comes down you'll

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.529 
of the track where it comes down you'll
see<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> there's<00:00:23.490> no<00:00:23.640> cross<00:00:23.880> ties<00:00:24.150> there's

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
see that there's no cross ties there's

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.630 
see that there's no cross ties there's
no<00:00:24.779> way<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.320> could<00:00:25.439> support<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.010> cart

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
no way that it could support a cart

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.980 
no way that it could support a cart
because<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.060> never<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> cart<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
because it's never had a cart on it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.620 
because it's never had a cart on it
before<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.609> built<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.060> way<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
before I just built it that way and I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
before I just built it that way and I
put<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.960> really<00:00:31.260> severe<00:00:31.769> bend<00:00:32.189> at<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> top

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
put that really severe bend at the top

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940 
put that really severe bend at the top
because<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.420> cart<00:00:33.660> can't<00:00:33.989> come<00:00:34.290> over<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
because the cart can't come over so

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.170 
because the cart can't come over so
right<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.430> we've<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> called<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
right now what we've got is called a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
right now what we've got is called a
shuttle<00:00:36.540> coaster<00:00:36.989> meaning<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> goes<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.950> one

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
shuttle coaster meaning it goes from one

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.200 
shuttle coaster meaning it goes from one
end<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> track<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> other<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.120> then

end of the track to the other and then
you<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> roll<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> cart<00:00:40.020> back<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> start

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you got to roll the cart back and start

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it's all new to me what we're doing here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.340 
it's all new to me what we're doing here
and<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> say<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.100> pretty<00:01:23.580> much<00:01:23.729> mean<00:01:23.970> me

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
and when I say we pretty much mean me

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.520 
and when I say we pretty much mean me
what<00:01:25.350> we're<00:01:25.470> doing<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.159> designing<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
what we're doing is we're designing the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.810 
what we're doing is we're designing the
lift<00:01:28.530> Hill<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
lift Hill so this is going to be the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.789 
lift Hill so this is going to be the
part<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> coaster<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:31.079> takes<00:01:31.290> us<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
part of the coaster that takes us up the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
part of the coaster that takes us up the
that<00:01:32.369> takes<00:01:32.579> us<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> hill<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.780> I've<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that takes us up hill so I've got a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
that takes us up hill so I've got a
camera<00:01:34.829> set<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> record<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> whole<00:01:35.820> thing

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
camera set up to record the whole thing

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960 
camera set up to record the whole thing
all<00:01:36.270> day<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.070> we'll<00:01:38.070> time-lapse<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
all day and we'll time-lapse it at the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.280 
all day and we'll time-lapse it at the
end<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> makes<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> look<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.110> whole<00:01:40.259> lot

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
end so that it makes it look a whole lot

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.280 
end so that it makes it look a whole lot
easier<00:01:40.710> than<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.750> I'll<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
easier than it is and I'll see on the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:02:53.170 
easier than it is and I'll see on the
other<00:01:43.439> side

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:05:17.460 

you

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:26.500 

so<00:05:18.470> that's<00:05:18.650> about<00:05:18.770> what<00:05:19.100> you<00:05:19.190> can<00:05:19.340> do<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.640> a<00:05:19.700> day

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.800 

what's<00:05:27.080> left<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.560> do<00:05:27.710> are<00:05:28.160> aside<00:05:29.090> from<00:05:29.300> kind<00:05:29.780> of

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
what's left to do are aside from kind of

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.350 
what's left to do are aside from kind of
some<00:05:29.990> minor<00:05:30.200> tweaks<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.950> adjustments<00:05:31.700> and

is<00:05:58.550> pretty<00:05:58.880> rigid<00:05:59.180> is<00:05:59.390> pretty<00:05:59.630> flexible<00:05:59.780> stuff

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
is pretty rigid is pretty flexible stuff

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.510 
is pretty rigid is pretty flexible stuff
I<00:06:00.350> mean<00:06:00.500> these<00:06:00.590> things<00:06:00.650> started<00:06:01.130> out<00:06:01.190> straight

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
I mean these things started out straight

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.620 
I mean these things started out straight
and<00:06:01.610> look<00:06:01.730> what<00:06:01.850> we've<00:06:01.970> done<00:06:02.000> we<00:06:02.300> turn<00:06:02.480> them

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
and look what we've done we turn them

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.620 
and look what we've done we turn them
into<00:06:02.750> very<00:06:03.500> pretzel<00:06:04.000> shapes<00:06:05.000> so<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:06.800> ties

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
into very pretzel shapes so the ties

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.010 
into very pretzel shapes so the ties
keep<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:08.840> PVC<00:06:09.380> from<00:06:09.650> going<00:06:10.660> spreading<00:06:11.660> apart

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
keep the PVC from going spreading apart

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.680 
keep the PVC from going spreading apart
and<00:06:12.290> the<00:06:12.860> cart<00:06:13.160> actually<00:06:13.400> keeps<00:06:13.910> the<00:06:14.090> PVC<00:06:14.480> from

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
and the cart actually keeps the PVC from

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.030 
and the cart actually keeps the PVC from
spreading<00:06:15.020> apart<00:06:15.080> too<00:06:15.470> if<00:06:15.620> you<00:06:15.710> look<00:06:15.860> at<00:06:15.950> the

spreading apart too if you look at the

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.380 
spreading apart too if you look at the

so<00:07:11.300> what<00:07:11.450> you<00:07:11.540> want<00:07:11.720> to<00:07:11.780> do<00:07:11.900> is<00:07:12.050> you<00:07:12.140> want<00:07:12.320> to

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
so what you want to do is you want to

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.200 
so what you want to do is you want to
conserve<00:07:12.800> that<00:07:13.160> you<00:07:13.370> want<00:07:13.580> to<00:07:13.670> make<00:07:13.790> sure<00:07:13.820> that

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
conserve that you want to make sure that

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.480 
conserve that you want to make sure that
you're<00:07:14.750> down<00:07:14.960> hills<00:07:15.290> are<00:07:15.560> smooth<00:07:15.890> you<00:07:16.250> want<00:07:16.430> to

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
you're down hills are smooth you want to

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.890 
you're down hills are smooth you want to
make<00:07:16.610> sure<00:07:16.640> that<00:07:16.940> the<00:07:17.060> friction<00:07:17.450> between<00:07:17.630> the

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
make sure that the friction between the

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.540 
make sure that the friction between the
wheels<00:07:18.050> and<00:07:18.290> the<00:07:18.380> track<00:07:18.650> is<00:07:18.680> as<00:07:19.040> low<00:07:19.190> as<00:07:19.340> it<00:07:19.370> can

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
wheels and the track is as low as it can

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.920 
wheels and the track is as low as it can
possibly<00:07:19.760> be<00:07:20.030> you<00:07:20.300> want<00:07:20.480> to<00:07:20.540> make<00:07:20.660> sure<00:07:20.810> the

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
possibly be you want to make sure the

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.619 
possibly be you want to make sure the
track<00:07:21.440> is<00:07:21.650> as<00:07:22.100> stiff<00:07:22.610> as<00:07:22.850> it<00:07:22.970> can<00:07:23.090> possible

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629 
track is as stiff as it can possible

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:25.570 
track is as stiff as it can possible
so<00:07:23.869> that<00:07:24.020> all<00:07:24.229> of<00:07:24.710> the<00:07:24.800> kinetic<00:07:25.159> energy<00:07:25.490> that

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
so that all of the kinetic energy that

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.459 
so that all of the kinetic energy that
you<00:07:25.699> start<00:07:25.939> out<00:07:26.089> with<00:07:26.119> at<00:07:26.899> the<00:07:27.080> beginning<00:07:27.349> of

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469 
you start out with at the beginning of

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:30.579 
you start out with at the beginning of
the<00:07:27.589> thing<00:07:27.740> translates<00:07:28.729> into<00:07:29.169> speed<00:07:30.169> because

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:30.589 
the thing translates into speed because

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:33.429 
the thing translates into speed because
that's<00:07:30.770> the<00:07:31.039> that's<00:07:31.490> the<00:07:31.639> fun<00:07:31.909> part<00:07:31.939> of<00:07:32.439> a

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:33.439 
that's the that's the fun part of a

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:35.919 
that's the that's the fun part of a
roller<00:07:34.339> coaster<00:07:34.669> and<00:07:34.819> if<00:07:35.240> you<00:07:35.330> have<00:07:35.479> too<00:07:35.749> much

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:35.929 
roller coaster and if you have too much

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.019 
roller coaster and if you have too much
speed<00:07:36.379> that's<00:07:36.679> an<00:07:36.860> easier<00:07:37.219> problem<00:07:37.520> to<00:07:37.849> solve

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:38.029 
speed that's an easier problem to solve

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:42.249 
speed that's an easier problem to solve
than<00:07:38.360> not<00:07:38.569> enough<00:07:38.599> so<00:07:40.240> that's<00:07:41.240> that's<00:07:41.869> one<00:07:42.139> of

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:42.259 
than not enough so that's that's one of

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.619 
than not enough so that's that's one of
the<00:07:42.349> things<00:07:42.529> that<00:07:42.770> you<00:07:42.949> ponder<00:07:43.639> so<00:07:43.999> we're

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:44.629 
the things that you ponder so we're

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.570 
the things that you ponder so we're
gonna<00:07:44.719> stiffen<00:07:45.020> the<00:07:45.169> track<00:07:45.379> up<00:07:45.559> tomorrow<00:07:45.949> by

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580 
gonna stiffen the track up tomorrow by

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.769 
gonna stiffen the track up tomorrow by
putting<00:07:46.849> those<00:07:46.969> stringers<00:07:47.360> in<00:07:47.389> between

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:47.779 
putting those stringers in between

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:48.909 
putting those stringers in between
things<00:07:48.020> and<00:07:48.139> then<00:07:48.289> I<00:07:48.349> think<00:07:48.499> we'll<00:07:48.619> be<00:07:48.679> ready

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 
things and then I think we'll be ready

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:50.859 
things and then I think we'll be ready
to<00:07:48.979> we'll<00:07:49.369> be<00:07:49.490> ready<00:07:49.669> to<00:07:49.789> do<00:07:50.149> a<00:07:50.179> test<00:07:50.509> run<00:07:50.599> we'll

00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:50.869 
to we'll be ready to do a test run we'll

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:52.299 
to we'll be ready to do a test run we'll
throw<00:07:51.050> a<00:07:51.080> couple<00:07:51.319> of<00:07:51.439> bags<00:07:51.619> of<00:07:51.800> sand<00:07:52.069> inside

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:52.309 
throw a couple of bags of sand inside

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:55.329 
throw a couple of bags of sand inside
the<00:07:52.789> inside<00:07:53.599> the<00:07:53.779> cart<00:07:54.020> and<00:07:54.349> run<00:07:55.039> the<00:07:55.159> card

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:55.339 
the inside the cart and run the card

00:07:55.339 --> 00:08:00.149 
the inside the cart and run the card
around<00:07:55.580> the<00:07:55.669> track<00:07:55.879> and<00:07:56.089> see<00:07:56.180> what<00:07:56.330> happens

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:03.579 

but<00:08:01.159> for<00:08:01.309> now<00:08:01.430> I<00:08:01.699> am<00:08:02.139> really<00:08:03.139> hungry<00:08:03.259> and

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:03.589 
but for now I am really hungry and

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.980 
but for now I am really hungry and
really<00:08:03.770> tired<00:08:04.279> so<00:08:04.729> I<00:08:04.999> I<00:08:05.360> mean<00:08:05.689> it<00:08:05.809> this<00:08:05.930> time

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:05.990 
really tired so I I mean it this time

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:11.770 
really tired so I I mean it this time
I'm<00:08:06.289> done<00:08:08.289> see<00:08:09.289> you<00:08:09.409> next<00:08:09.649> time
