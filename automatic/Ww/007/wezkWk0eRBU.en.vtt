00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.790 

and<00:00:16.150> so<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.180> have<00:00:17.480> tried<00:00:17.779> ramming<00:00:18.350> a<00:00:18.439> different

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
and so I have tried ramming a different

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.190 
and so I have tried ramming a different
speed<00:00:19.039> starting<00:00:19.700> from<00:00:19.730> 10<00:00:20.150> meters<00:00:20.180> per<00:00:20.660> second

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
speed starting from 10 meters per second

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
speed starting from 10 meters per second
up<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:21.920> 130<00:00:22.670> meters<00:00:23.680> with<00:00:24.680> 10<00:00:24.980> meter

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
up to 130 meters with 10 meter

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
up to 130 meters with 10 meter
increments<00:00:25.939> here<00:00:26.570> you<00:00:26.689> can<00:00:26.840> see<00:00:27.050> results<00:00:28.240> as

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
increments here you can see results as

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.760 
increments here you can see results as
you<00:00:29.450> see<00:00:29.660> the<00:00:29.809> image<00:00:29.989> increases<00:00:30.559> with<00:00:30.739> speed

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
you see the image increases with speed

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.120 
you see the image increases with speed
and<00:00:31.780> judging<00:00:32.780> from<00:00:32.809> this<00:00:33.170> graphic<00:00:33.530> I<00:00:33.920> would

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
and judging from this graphic I would

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.389 
and judging from this graphic I would
say<00:00:34.399> that<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:35.239> particular<00:00:35.570> asp<00:00:36.200> would<00:00:37.160> blow

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
say that this particular asp would blow

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.110 
say that this particular asp would blow
up<00:00:37.430> with<00:00:38.180> lightweight<00:00:38.390> are<00:00:38.809> more<00:00:39.140> at<00:00:39.820> 150<00:00:40.820> to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
up with lightweight are more at 150 to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.680 
up with lightweight are more at 150 to
160<00:00:41.750> meters<00:00:42.230> per<00:00:42.380> second<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:42.980> as<00:00:43.940> usually<00:00:44.480> I

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
160 meters per second and as usually I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.760 
160 meters per second and as usually I
have<00:00:45.050> kept<00:00:45.350> my<00:00:45.469> sheep<00:00:46.070> at<00:00:46.520> exactly<00:00:47.210> same<00:00:47.540> as<00:00:47.810> so

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
have kept my sheep at exactly same as so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.190 
have kept my sheep at exactly same as so
the<00:00:49.130> ship<00:00:49.310> mass<00:00:49.550> did<00:00:49.880> not<00:00:50.030> affect<00:00:50.360> results<00:00:51.110> in

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
the ship mass did not affect results in

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.660 
the ship mass did not affect results in
any<00:00:51.320> way<00:00:52.210> also<00:00:53.210> several<00:00:53.720> times<00:00:54.190> upon<00:00:55.190> ramming

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
any way also several times upon ramming

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.960 
any way also several times upon ramming
I<00:00:55.880> did<00:00:56.060> not<00:00:56.210> receive<00:00:56.570> any<00:00:56.840> damage<00:00:57.470> and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
I did not receive any damage and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.300 
I did not receive any damage and
sometimes<00:00:58.970> I<00:00:59.239> receive<00:00:59.630> double<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:00.380> if<00:01:00.950> you

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
sometimes I receive double and if you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.819 
sometimes I receive double and if you
RAM<00:01:01.700> with<00:01:02.329> your<00:01:02.540> ship<00:01:02.870> which<00:01:03.079> already<00:01:03.320> is

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
RAM with your ship which already is

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.370 
RAM with your ship which already is
damaged<00:01:04.309> results<00:01:05.210> are<00:01:05.360> inconsistent<00:01:05.720> it's

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
damaged results are inconsistent it's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.289 
damaged results are inconsistent it's
like<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:06.770> can<00:01:06.950> damage<00:01:07.310> your<00:01:07.340> ship<00:01:07.549> more<00:01:08.000> if

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
like you can damage your ship more if

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.690 
like you can damage your ship more if
it's<00:01:08.570> already<00:01:08.960> damaged<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:09.979> be<00:01:10.130> careful<00:01:10.579> if

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's already damaged so be careful if

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.810 
it's already damaged so be careful if
you<00:01:10.850> already<00:01:11.000> are<00:01:11.509> damaged<00:01:12.399> probably<00:01:13.399> reming

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
you already are damaged probably reming

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.410 
you already are damaged probably reming
is<00:01:13.970> not<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.210> good<00:01:14.479> idea<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.170> above<00:01:16.130> 100<00:01:16.640> m/s

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
is not a good idea and above 100 m/s

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.020 
is not a good idea and above 100 m/s
I've<00:01:17.570> also<00:01:17.749> tried<00:01:17.990> Hal<00:01:18.889> reinforcement<00:01:19.789> class

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
I've also tried Hal reinforcement class

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.200 
I've also tried Hal reinforcement class
5<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.749> mirrored<00:01:21.319> armoire<00:01:21.859> as<00:01:22.819> you<00:01:22.999> see

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
5 and mirrored armoire as you see

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.599 
5 and mirrored armoire as you see
mirrored<00:01:23.569> armoire<00:01:23.990> was<00:01:24.200> best<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.280> even<00:01:25.429> with

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
mirrored armoire was best but even with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.690 
mirrored armoire was best but even with
van<00:01:25.969> class<00:01:26.299> 5<00:01:26.689> hull<00:01:27.020> reinforcement<00:01:27.920> ramming

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.379 
van class 5 hull reinforcement ramming
into<00:01:28.999> stuff<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.689> safer<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:32.119> holler

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389 
into stuff is safer so holler

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:34.779 
into stuff is safer so holler

holler<00:01:42.229> enforcement<00:01:43.130> with<00:01:43.399> mirrored<00:01:43.819> armoire

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
holler enforcement with mirrored armoire

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.769 
holler enforcement with mirrored armoire
or<00:01:44.799> reactive<00:01:45.799> or<00:01:45.920> military<00:01:46.490> which<00:01:47.270> as<00:01:47.569> we

exactly same protection so if you want

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.660 
exactly same protection so if you want
