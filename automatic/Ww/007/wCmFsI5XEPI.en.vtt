00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
your thumbs in this position here we've

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.450 
your thumbs in this position here we've
got<00:01:08.640> thumb<00:01:08.970> around<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> probably

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
got thumb around which is probably

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.039 
got thumb around which is probably
traditional<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> beginner<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
traditional for a beginner to use and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.350 
traditional for a beginner to use and
then<00:01:13.560> you've<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.890> thumb<00:01:14.159> over<00:01:14.400> which<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
then you've got thumb over which is that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.160 
then you've got thumb over which is that
position<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:16.670> for<00:01:17.670> heavier<00:01:18.420> bench<00:01:18.900> press

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
position there for heavier bench press

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.660 
position there for heavier bench press
movement<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:20.009> probably<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.520> more

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
movement that's probably a more

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.130 
movement that's probably a more
comfortable<00:01:20.970> position<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:21.930> talk

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
comfortable position but let's talk

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140 
comfortable position but let's talk
beginner<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:23.040> thumbs<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.700> around<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
beginner and go thumbs back around the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.109 
beginner and go thumbs back around the
bar<00:01:24.330> okay<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.100> spotter<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
bar okay as the spotter you want to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.640 
bar okay as the spotter you want to
count<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.479> person<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> make<00:01:28.470> sure

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
they're ready to go so we'll count them

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
they're ready to go so we'll count them
in<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> moment<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.799> we'll<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.070> dialed

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
in in a moment and then we'll get dialed

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.010 
in in a moment and then we'll get dialed
at<00:01:32.460> perform<00:01:32.790> three<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.240> four<00:01:33.420> reps<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
at perform three or four reps at the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.399 
at perform three or four reps at the
right<00:01:34.200> tempo<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.520> go<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.939> two<00:01:36.479> three<00:01:37.140> up

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
right tempo so we go one two three up

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
right tempo so we go one two three up
and<00:01:38.329> away<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> goes<00:01:41.240> nice<00:01:42.240> control<00:01:42.780> movement

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and away it goes nice control movement

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
and away it goes nice control movement
down<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> nipple<00:01:44.399> line<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.759> these<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
down to the nipple line is these the is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.999 
down to the nipple line is these the is
the<00:01:45.869> region<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> bar<00:01:46.979> to

the region that you want the bar to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
the region that you want the bar to
travel<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> client

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
travel to and then you have the client

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.960 
travel to and then you have the client
doing<00:01:49.380> good<00:01:49.710> controlled<00:01:50.189> movements<00:01:50.729> down

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
doing good controlled movements down

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
doing good controlled movements down
touching<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.259> straight<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.920> we

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
touching and then straight back up we

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.910
