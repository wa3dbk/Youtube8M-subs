I<00:00:10.520> think<00:00:11.360> it's<00:00:11.480> really<00:00:11.660> important<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.230> one<00:00:12.350> of

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
I think it's really important is one of

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.960 
I think it's really important is one of
the<00:00:12.530> larger<00:00:12.890> employers<00:00:13.010> in<00:00:13.520> the<00:00:13.550> raleigh<00:00:13.820> area

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
to support our community and so it was

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.280 
to support our community and so it was
an<00:00:16.760> easy<00:00:16.880> decision<00:00:17.090> once<00:00:17.660> we<00:00:17.780> heard<00:00:17.900> about<00:00:18.050> the

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
an easy decision once we heard about the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.290 
an easy decision once we heard about the
cow<00:00:18.440> parade<00:00:18.710> to<00:00:19.070> go<00:00:19.220> ahead<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:19.670> sponsor<00:00:20.119> it

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
and I lived in Switzerland a while back

and I lived in Switzerland a while back
where<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:22.970> cow<00:00:23.119> parade<00:00:23.390> idea<00:00:23.720> originally

where the cow parade idea originally

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.900 
where the cow parade idea originally
started<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.010> I<00:00:25.040> kind<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.340> had<00:00:25.490> a<00:00:25.520> personal

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
started so I kind of had a personal

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.300 
started so I kind of had a personal
affinity<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.960> go<00:00:27.110> ahead<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:27.560> sign<00:00:27.710> up<00:00:27.920> as<00:00:28.130> soon

as<00:00:28.430> we<00:00:28.550> got<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.820> word<00:00:28.970> we<00:00:29.600> thought<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.050> was<00:00:30.260> a

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
as we got the word we thought this was a

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.589 
as we got the word we thought this was a
great<00:00:30.560> cause<00:00:31.280> to<00:00:31.610> support<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.270> all<00:00:32.419> the

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
great cause to support and all the

in with whatever pattern they liked and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.240 
in with whatever pattern they liked and
that<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.189> could

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that was a way that they could

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
that was a way that they could
contribute<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.030> even<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:54.960> didn't<00:01:55.170> think

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
contribute to even if they didn't think

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
contribute to even if they didn't think
they<00:01:55.470> could<00:01:55.500> draw<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> cow<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.450> reason<00:01:57.689> we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
they could draw a cow so the reason we

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
they could draw a cow so the reason we
came<00:01:57.900> up<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.470> sticker<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.850> then

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
came up with the sticker is because then

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510 
came up with the sticker is because then
we<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.390> take<00:02:01.020> people's<00:02:01.320> drawings<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> trace

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
we can take people's drawings and trace

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.460 
we can take people's drawings and trace
them<00:02:02.670> into<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> computer<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.259> keep

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
them into the computer and it will keep

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.770 
them into the computer and it will keep
the<00:02:04.860> artwork<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:05.939> created

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the artwork that they created

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.830 
the artwork that they created
in<00:02:07.350> place<00:02:07.789> are<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.850> actually<00:02:09.209> printing<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
in place are we actually printing this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.949 
in place are we actually printing this

printing the graphics as well as testing

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.990 
printing the graphics as well as testing
out<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:24.260> pressure<00:02:25.260> sensitive

high-performance<00:02:27.000> vinyls<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:28.080> right<00:02:28.260> so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050 

would<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.400> make<00:02:32.610> sense<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:34.700> are<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.819> just<00:02:36.000> gonna

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
would it make sense if are we just gonna

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.290 
would it make sense if are we just gonna
place<00:02:36.390> everything<00:02:36.750> person

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.790 

virtualized<00:02:40.300> cow<00:02:40.660> that's<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.740> my

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
virtualized cow that's one of my

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.900 
virtualized cow that's one of my
favorites<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.920> point<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:45.850> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
favorites so this point it's like a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.610 
favorites so this point it's like a
puzzle<00:02:46.510> because<00:02:47.160> we're<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.490> enlarging<00:02:49.620> cows

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
puzzle because we're just enlarging cows

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.270 
puzzle because we're just enlarging cows
and<00:02:51.720> trying<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.840> figure<00:02:53.080> out<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.530> ones<00:02:53.830> fit

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
and trying to figure out which ones fit

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.000 
and trying to figure out which ones fit
into<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.819> different<00:02:55.180> spaces<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.200> they're

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
into the different spaces and they're

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.910 
into the different spaces and they're
just<00:02:57.340> printed<00:02:57.700> out<00:02:57.819> onto<00:02:58.270> paper<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.830> to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
just printed out onto paper and have to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.530 
just printed out onto paper and have to
go<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.370> kind<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.700> cut<00:03:00.910> them<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.420> little

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
go in and kind of cut them out a little

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.630 
go in and kind of cut them out a little
closer<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.440> then<00:03:02.650> they<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:02.830> fit<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
closer to that then they can fit on the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.540 
closer to that then they can fit on the
cow<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:04.630> probably<00:03:05.170> does<00:03:05.410> just<00:03:05.830> make<00:03:06.010> sense<00:03:06.250> to

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
cow it probably does just make sense to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.760 
cow it probably does just make sense to
do<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.730> as<00:03:06.940> we're<00:03:07.090> measuring<00:03:07.330> from<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.530> we'll

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
do it as we're measuring from that we'll

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.559 
do it as we're measuring from that we'll
be<00:03:08.800> able<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.400> figure<00:03:09.580> out<00:03:09.850> how<00:03:10.090> many<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.420> them

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
be able to figure out how many of them

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.410 
be able to figure out how many of them
we<00:03:10.959> can<00:03:11.110> actually<00:03:11.290> get<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.670> cow<00:03:12.970> and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
we can actually get on to the cow and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.370 
we can actually get on to the cow and
then<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:14.410> can<00:03:14.620> make<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.830> big<00:03:15.250> pre<00:03:15.489> sheet<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:16.380> ones

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
then we can make a big pre sheet of ones

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.030 
then we can make a big pre sheet of ones
to<00:03:17.530> send<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.920> printer<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:23.620> printed<00:03:23.920> off<00:03:24.010> a

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
to send to the printer we printed off a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.280 
to send to the printer we printed off a
test<00:03:24.430> sample<00:03:24.780> there<00:03:25.780> are<00:03:25.870> two<00:03:25.989> different

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
test sample there are two different

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.970 
test sample there are two different
files<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.800> we've<00:03:26.950> received<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:28.800> just<00:03:29.800> shows

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
files that we've received and just shows

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.420 
files that we've received and just shows
a<00:03:30.010> reverse<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> regular<00:03:32.430> black

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
a reverse out and then the regular black

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.430 
a reverse out and then the regular black
on<00:03:33.819> white<00:03:34.209> print<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:36.400> cow<00:03:36.610> is<00:03:36.670> white<00:03:37.030> right<00:03:37.440> so

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
on white print the cow is white right so

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.680 
on white print the cow is white right so
it's<00:03:38.709> going<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:38.980> be<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:40.209> know<00:03:40.300> you<00:03:40.360> don't<00:03:40.569> have

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
it's going to be you know you don't have

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.780 
it's going to be you know you don't have
to<00:03:40.780> be<00:03:40.900> completely<00:03:41.470> accurate<00:03:41.590> with<00:03:42.459> something

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
to be completely accurate with something

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.310 
to be completely accurate with something
like<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.060> because<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.780> white<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:43.989> going<00:03:44.260> to

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
like this because the white is going to

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.810 
like this because the white is going to
be<00:03:44.380> very<00:03:44.440> close<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.070> white<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.640> have

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
be very close to the white that you have

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:53.240 
be very close to the white that you have
already

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.899 

and<00:03:54.250> that's<00:03:54.670> one<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:54.909> the<00:03:55.239> very<00:03:55.900> many<00:03:56.909> cows

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
and that's one of the very many cows

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.599 
and that's one of the very many cows
that<00:03:58.239> they<00:03:58.390> have<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.099> been<00:04:00.219> great<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.459> see

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
that they have so it's been great to see

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:01.770 
that they have so it's been great to see
all<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.790> designs<00:04:01.060> kind<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.359> coming<00:04:01.659> in<00:04:01.750> and

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
all the designs kind of coming in and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.869 
all the designs kind of coming in and
seeing<00:04:02.709> how<00:04:02.859> personal<00:04:03.280> as<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:03.519> are<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.849> just

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
seeing how personal as they are and just

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.610 
seeing how personal as they are and just
knowing<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.329> we<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.629> actually<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:05.469> they

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
knowing that we can actually that they

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
Hospital one of my favorite designs I

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.089 
Hospital one of my favorite designs I
think<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.120> far<00:04:34.500> was<00:04:35.500> one<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.830> we<00:04:35.919> got

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
think so far was one that we got

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.279 
think so far was one that we got
yesterday<00:04:36.490> when<00:04:36.910> we<00:04:37.030> went<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.419> Children's

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
yesterday when we went to the Children's

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.110 
yesterday when we went to the Children's
Hospital<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.949> he<00:04:39.190> had<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:39.430> much<00:04:39.580> fun<00:04:39.789> drawing

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
Hospital and he had so much fun drawing

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.749 
Hospital and he had so much fun drawing
on<00:04:40.539> that<00:04:40.720> sheet<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.990> paper<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.560> i<00:04:41.830> think<00:04:42.669> his

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
on that sheet of paper so i think his

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.400 
on that sheet of paper so i think his
will<00:04:43.090> probably<00:04:43.389> be<00:04:43.479> prominently<00:04:43.960> displayed

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
will probably be prominently displayed

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:52.740 
will probably be prominently displayed
on<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.620> cow

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.930 

it'd<00:04:53.230> be<00:04:53.350> really<00:04:53.560> cool<00:04:53.770> for<00:04:53.830> people<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.370> go

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
it'd be really cool for people to go

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.190 
it'd be really cool for people to go
look<00:04:55.120> at<00:04:55.210> their<00:04:55.390> cow<00:04:55.570> they<00:04:55.840> can<00:04:55.990> see<00:04:56.170> their

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
look at their cow they can see their

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.560 
look at their cow they can see their
signature<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.730> know<00:04:57.850> they<00:04:58.000> helped<00:04:58.270> make

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
signature and you know they helped make

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.310 
signature and you know they helped make
this<00:04:58.690> one<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.020> life<00:04:59.170> is<00:05:00.100> going<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.370> be<00:05:00.430> a

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.340 

but<00:05:03.920> I<00:05:03.950> think<00:05:04.160> what's<00:05:04.280> really<00:05:04.390> exciting<00:05:05.390> and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
but I think what's really exciting and

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.230 
but I think what's really exciting and
unique<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.310> differentiating<00:05:07.940> about<00:05:08.090> this

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
unique and differentiating about this

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.910 
unique and differentiating about this
project<00:05:08.510> is<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.200> doesn't<00:05:09.500> matter<00:05:09.650> what

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
project is that it doesn't matter what

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.500 
project is that it doesn't matter what
your<00:05:10.100> cow<00:05:10.280> looks<00:05:10.520> like<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.940> fact<00:05:11.120> that<00:05:11.240> it's<00:05:11.330> a

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
your cow looks like the fact that it's a

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.940 
your cow looks like the fact that it's a
part<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.810> something<00:05:12.140> bigger<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.680> really

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
part of something bigger is really

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.140 
part of something bigger is really
what's<00:05:13.130> important<00:05:13.940> here<00:05:14.030> i<00:05:15.670> think<00:05:16.670> people<00:05:17.000> are

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
what's important here i think people are

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.400 
what's important here i think people are
going<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.330> be<00:05:17.390> really<00:05:17.660> excited<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.290> really

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410
