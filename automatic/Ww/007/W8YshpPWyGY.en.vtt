for a very very long time since the

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.360 
for a very very long time since the

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
world I did show you the other day and

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.940 
world I did show you the other day and
we<00:06:37.610> need<00:06:37.729> to<00:06:37.820> go<00:06:37.910> this<00:06:38.060> direction<00:06:38.500> to<00:06:39.500> find<00:06:39.740> out

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
we need to go this direction to find out

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.670 
we need to go this direction to find out
the<00:06:40.280> last<00:06:40.810> jungle<00:06:41.810> biome<00:06:42.110> and<00:06:42.229> then<00:06:42.440> obviously

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
the last jungle biome and then obviously

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.710 
the last jungle biome and then obviously
we<00:06:43.039> could<00:06:43.370> keep<00:06:43.520> on<00:06:43.700> going<00:06:44.120> you

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
we could keep on going you

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.050 
we could keep on going you
we'll<00:06:44.780> find<00:06:45.080> something<00:06:45.530> else<00:06:45.890> and<00:06:46.220> that<00:06:46.490> is<00:06:46.820> a

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
we'll find something else and that is a

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.120 
we'll find something else and that is a
San<00:06:47.480> biome<00:06:47.900> now<00:06:48.050> some<00:06:48.320> bones<00:06:48.620> are<00:06:48.770> always
