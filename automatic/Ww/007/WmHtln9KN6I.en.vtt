benchmark<00:01:23.160> on<00:01:23.340> ultra<00:01:23.730> bear<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.150> mind<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
benchmark on ultra bear in mind this is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.360 
benchmark on ultra bear in mind this is
also<00:01:24.660> used<00:01:24.870> in<00:01:24.930> fraps<00:01:25.260> that's<00:01:26.040> basically<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
also used in fraps that's basically a

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.860 
also used in fraps that's basically a
benchmark<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.000> Olson<00:01:27.420> said<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.660> did<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
benchmark on Olson said I did the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.720 
benchmark on Olson said I did the
benchmarks<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.530> 250<00:01:29.010> online<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
benchmarks on the 250 online and

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.820 
benchmarks on the 250 online and
basically<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.840> average<00:01:30.870> thought<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:31.440> got<00:01:31.650> was

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
basically the average thought I got was

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.940 
basically the average thought I got was
35<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.330> lowest<00:01:33.510> i<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.080> 25<00:01:34.620> you<00:01:34.890> see

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
35 and the lowest i got was 25 you see

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
35 and the lowest i got was 25 you see
explosions<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.700> stuff<00:01:35.760> i<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.360> wanted<00:01:36.510> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
explosions and stuff i just wanted to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
explosions and stuff i just wanted to
give<00:01:36.660> you<00:01:36.750> guys<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.260> of<00:01:37.350> lowest<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.860> low

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
give you guys kind of lowest of the low

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
give you guys kind of lowest of the low
there<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.780> unlock<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.070> 260x<00:01:41.070> i<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:42.240> an

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
there and unlock to the 260x i got an

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
there and unlock to the 260x i got an
average<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.800> 70<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:45.060> lowest<00:01:45.240> i<00:01:45.480> got<00:01:45.660> was

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
average of 70 and the lowest i got was

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.660 
average of 70 and the lowest i got was
actually<00:01:46.140> 30<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> bit<00:01:46.980> low<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.400> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
actually 30 so it's a bit low there but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
actually 30 so it's a bit low there but
that<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.480> obviously<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.810> ultra<00:01:49.230> as<00:01:49.320> well<00:01:49.500> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that was obviously on ultra as well so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.310 
that was obviously on ultra as well so
any<00:01:49.860> sort<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.690> explosions<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.870> so<00:01:51.960> far<00:01:52.110> does

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
any sort of explosions and so far does

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.260 
any sort of explosions and so far does
cause<00:01:52.530> us<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.770> drop<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.880> went<00:01:54.030> from<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
cause us to drop and it went from the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
cause us to drop and it went from the
average<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.690> 70<00:01:55.140> down<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.590> low<00:01:55.650> as<00:01:55.830> 30

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
average of about 70 down to as low as 30

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.890 
average of about 70 down to as low as 30
when<00:01:56.400> those<00:01:56.550> stuff<00:01:56.760> like<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> happening<00:01:57.330> by

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
when those stuff like that happening by

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.080 
when those stuff like that happening by
ultra<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.680> pretty<00:01:58.950> damn<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.280> continuing

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ultra that's pretty damn good continuing

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
ultra that's pretty damn good continuing
is<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> very<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.810> cheap<00:02:00.960> graphics<00:02:01.320> card<00:02:01.500> now

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
is a very very cheap graphics card now

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.720 
is a very very cheap graphics card now
on<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.830> 270's<00:02:04.830> basically<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.370> not

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
on to the 270's basically this is not

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.350 
on to the 270's basically this is not
the<00:02:05.820> 270<00:02:06.270> XO<00:02:06.630> thinks<00:02:06.870> only<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.260> 270<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.360> right

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the 270 XO thinks only the 270 and right

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.770 
the 270 XO thinks only the 270 and right
now<00:02:09.509> I've<00:02:09.720> got<00:02:09.750> 85<00:02:10.470> there<00:02:11.159> is<00:02:11.400> only<00:02:11.790> 17<00:02:12.360> about

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
now I've got 85 there is only 17 about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.770 
now I've got 85 there is only 17 about
85<00:02:13.250> for<00:02:14.250> average<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.790> lowest<00:02:15.000> was<00:02:15.269> 40<00:02:15.720> so

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
85 for average and the lowest was 40 so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.090 
85 for average and the lowest was 40 so
it's<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.020> too<00:02:16.200> bad<00:02:16.350> either<00:02:16.380> considering<00:02:16.920> it's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's not too bad either considering it's

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's not too bad either considering it's
still<00:02:17.280> around<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.670> cheap<00:02:17.819> graphics<00:02:18.210> card

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
still around with cheap graphics card

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
still around with cheap graphics card
now<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.440> my<00:02:19.560> current

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
can I actually have my system myself the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.520 
can I actually have my system myself the
280x<00:02:23.160> now<00:02:23.670> basically<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.180> oh<00:02:24.420> my<00:02:25.019> god<00:02:25.260> this

bestow<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> 7970<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.410> machine<00:02:34.650> before<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.099> this

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
bestow a 7970 my machine before and this

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.250 
bestow a 7970 my machine before and this
thing<00:02:35.940> blew<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.569> water<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.110> it's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
thing blew it out of the water and it's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.740 
thing blew it out of the water and it's
cheaper<00:02:37.709> than<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.920> 79<00:02:38.280> 70<00:02:38.670> before<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.330> set<00:02:39.569> up

cheaper than a 79 70 before I to set up
fried<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.140> Southwestern<00:02:40.709> uncertainty<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.310> now

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
fried a Southwestern uncertainty and now

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.539 
fried a Southwestern uncertainty and now
i<00:02:41.519> have<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.910> HS<00:02:42.330> 280x<00:02:43.200> munching<00:02:43.739> I'm<00:02:44.400> telling

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
i have a HS 280x munching I'm telling

you guys this been got an average of 135
on<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.049> 44<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.480> unbelievable<00:02:51.480> that's

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
on that 44 which is unbelievable that's

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.069 
on that 44 which is unbelievable that's
crazy<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:53.280> crazy<00:02:53.540> although<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.750> lowest

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
crazy that's crazy although the lowest

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.710 
crazy that's crazy although the lowest
did<00:02:55.650> drop<00:02:55.920> down<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.250> 75<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.360> still<00:02:57.510> pretty

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
did drop down to 75 it's still pretty

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.059 
did drop down to 75 it's still pretty
damn<00:02:57.959> good<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.440> lowest<00:02:58.739> do<00:02:58.829> stuff<00:02:59.010> like

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
damn good for the lowest do stuff like

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.830 
damn good for the lowest do stuff like
explosions<00:02:59.519> happening<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.540> really

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
explosions happening so I really really

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.449 
explosions happening so I really really
was<00:03:01.049> thoroughly<00:03:01.560> impressed<00:03:01.769> with<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.099> by

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
was thoroughly impressed with that by

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.839 
was thoroughly impressed with that by
the<00:03:02.489> way<00:03:02.610> all<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:02.880> these<00:03:03.150> are<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:04.160> 1920<00:03:05.160> x<00:03:05.340> 1080

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
the way all of these are at 1920 x 1080

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.080 
the way all of these are at 1920 x 1080
P<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.930> there's<00:03:07.290> your<00:03:07.319> settings<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.879> I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
P so there's your settings there and I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.670 
P so there's your settings there and I
was<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.569> did<00:03:09.780> do<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> little<00:03:10.170> bit<00:03:10.290> research

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
was and I did do a little bit research

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.009 
was and I did do a little bit research
as<00:03:10.829> well<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.190> apparently<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.569> pic<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.959> a

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
as well and apparently the pic of a

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.020 
as well and apparently the pic of a
whiskey<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.440> think<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.709> believe<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.040> 290<00:03:14.790> is

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
whiskey I think I believe the 290 is

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.119 
whiskey I think I believe the 290 is
meant<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.629> be<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> next<00:03:15.900> step<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.680> then

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
meant to be the next step up and then

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.130 
meant to be the next step up and then
there's<00:03:17.310> also<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.579> 290x<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.390> find<00:03:18.599> 298

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
there's also the 290x you can find 298

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.809 
there's also the 290x you can find 298
bench<00:03:19.470> mob<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.769> i<00:03:19.829> do<00:03:19.980> i'll<00:03:20.069> post<00:03:20.310> up<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:20.670> well

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
bench mob if i do i'll post up as well

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.580 
bench mob if i do i'll post up as well
but<00:03:21.390> i<00:03:21.420> found<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.660> 290<00:03:22.140> bench<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.470> an

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
but i found a 290 bench like an

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.770 
but i found a 290 bench like an
apparently<00:03:22.920> i<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.160> only<00:03:23.280> kicking<00:03:23.579> out<00:03:23.670> 110<00:03:24.480> on

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
apparently i was only kicking out 110 on

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.110 
apparently i was only kicking out 110 on
average<00:03:25.200> with<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> lowest<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.280> 80<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.880> lower

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
average with a lowest of 80 so the lower

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.900 
average with a lowest of 80 so the lower
is<00:03:27.480> higher<00:03:28.139> but<00:03:28.799> apparently<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.489> average<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
is higher but apparently the average is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.910 
is higher but apparently the average is
only<00:03:30.030> hundred<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.450> ten<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.900> i<00:03:31.109> don't<00:03:31.709> know<00:03:31.769> if

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
only hundred and ten so i don't know if

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.879 
only hundred and ten so i don't know if
it's<00:03:32.630> better<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:34.019> average<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.590> more<00:03:34.739> weight

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
it's better in average but more weight

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.289 
it's better in average but more weight
it<00:03:35.280> obviously<00:03:35.400> depends<00:03:35.819> on<00:03:35.910> people's<00:03:36.180> systems

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
it obviously depends on people's systems

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.000 
it obviously depends on people's systems
and<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.690> house<00:03:36.810> hooker<00:03:37.109> figured<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.739> could

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
and the house hooker figured it could

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.920 
and the house hooker figured it could
just<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.489> fact<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.790> it's<00:03:39.209> not<00:03:39.569> got

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
just be the fact that it's not got

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.080 
just be the fact that it's not got
updated<00:03:40.859> drivers<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.579> stuff<00:03:41.639> it<00:03:41.880> may<00:03:42.030> be

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
updated drivers and stuff it may be

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.490 
updated drivers and stuff it may be
still<00:03:42.329> be<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.630> beta<00:03:42.840> drivers<00:03:43.319> for<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
still be on what beta drivers for the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.289 
still be on what beta drivers for the
290<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.489> i<00:03:44.609> believe<00:03:44.730> they're<00:03:44.940> only<00:03:45.090> just

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
290 as i believe they're only just

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.319 
290 as i believe they're only just
released<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.660> 290<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.230> 290x<00:03:46.639> so<00:03:47.639> I<00:03:47.670> believe

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
released the 290 and 290x so I believe

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.940 
released the 290 and 290x so I believe
the<00:03:48.540> 280x<00:03:49.109> was<00:03:49.380> out<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> little<00:03:49.680> bit<00:03:49.799> before

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
the 280x was out a little bit before

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.740 
the 280x was out a little bit before
along<00:03:50.639> with<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:50.849> whole<00:03:51.000> kind<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.269> range<00:03:51.450> here

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
along with this whole kind of range here

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.979 
along with this whole kind of range here
so<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.160> fingers<00:03:53.160> crossed<00:03:53.400> there<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.269> but

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
so I'm fingers crossed there we go but
