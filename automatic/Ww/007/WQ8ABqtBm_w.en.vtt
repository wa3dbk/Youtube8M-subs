00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
so that's a big the fact that

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.740 
so that's a big the fact that
the<00:03:15.810> old<00:03:16.049> lenses<00:03:16.620> don't<00:03:16.829> work<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.630> other

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
equipment and I actually don't think I'm

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.319 
equipment and I actually don't think I'm
just<00:03:25.350> completely<00:03:25.829> biased<00:03:26.250> because<00:03:26.910> I've<00:03:27.120> been

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
just completely biased because I've been

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.729 
just completely biased because I've been
playing<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.900> lot<00:03:28.079> with<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.950> Canon<00:03:29.400> 60d<00:03:30.739> which

and<00:03:35.810> I've<00:03:36.810> gotta<00:03:37.049> say<00:03:37.519> one<00:03:38.519> thing<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:39.000> know

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
and I've gotta say one thing you know

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.800 
and I've gotta say one thing you know
that<00:03:39.480> really<00:03:39.870> really<00:03:40.470> impresses<00:03:41.220> me<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
that really really impresses me with the

that really really impresses me with the
the<00:03:43.350> Nikon<00:03:43.859> is<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:45.540> fact<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
the Nikon is the fact that just the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.559 
the Nikon is the fact that just the
whole<00:03:47.700> feel<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.840> way<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.290> build<00:03:49.560> quality<00:03:49.950> is

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
whole feel the way the build quality is

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.640 
whole feel the way the build quality is
it<00:03:51.569> just<00:03:52.049> seems<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.739> be<00:03:52.920> more<00:03:53.340> heavy-duty

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
a very very interesting thing but in my

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.200 
a very very interesting thing but in my
opinion<00:06:03.510> there<00:06:04.510> are<00:06:04.540> many<00:06:04.960> reasons<00:06:05.590> why<00:06:06.210> Nikon

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
opinion there are many reasons why Nikon

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.670 
opinion there are many reasons why Nikon
is<00:06:07.240> superior<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.500> Canon<00:06:09.280> I<00:06:09.690> will<00:06:10.690> say<00:06:10.960> this<00:06:11.230> if

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
is superior to Canon I will say this if

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.260 
is superior to Canon I will say this if
you're<00:06:12.520> after<00:06:12.790> a<00:06:12.970> camera<00:06:13.570> to<00:06:14.290> do<00:06:14.669> handle<00:06:15.669> film

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
I think the Canon has the edge in film
