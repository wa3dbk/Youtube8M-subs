00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.810
 personal hello okay you are in each 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.730
 day friends of the channel of the game look only the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.770
 Staff asked me what camera errors 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.180
 to fewer people using the camera 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.939
 This one is a Canon FX 50hs a 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.950
 very good campaign to know and 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.810
 quality but I want to show you 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.050
 a very cool thing she does that I 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.090
 super zoom and I here in the condo has 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.010
 a vision that is very good up here and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.440
 I was hoping to show up at 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.200
 window to be able to shoot with your 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.410
 So I'm going to give a superzoom in her 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.500
 You see he knows I'm going to show the moon. 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.140
 may already be the one who fights there 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.270
 behind and I'm going to pull a zoom 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.130
 I will try ignition key for you 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.430
 What does this camera do? 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.689
 Awesome, look, I'm going here to 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 back and see if I can not shake the 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.280
 camera and I'll pull the south 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.950
 Look at that white spot is moon 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.329
 so, just look, I'm just gonna zoom in. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:29.179
 I'm leaving the camera here in focus and I'm going 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:35.299
 to bring in the only 1 was to stabilize the 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:36.700
 image stabilizing let pull more 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.020
 a little 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.259
 people look this looks just a detail 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.969
 craters he wants is very much cable 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:54.049
 green is more than half the south it has 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.299
 200 x Jesus, I'm awesome! 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.889
 here, why let me see if I can 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.759
 without trembling 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:05.159
 look this here is 100 x it reaches 200 x 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:12.030
 let it pull a little bit 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:15.090
 I'll put it here look 125 now 150 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.010
 up to 200 but it's because when I put 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.060
 200 ha and gets very close here is 200 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.280
 just twisted for you to see the craters 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.739
 details go back a little just to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.170
 put on the screen and it's cool that she takes 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.480
 the tremendous clothes had to have been signed 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.049
 but she here but you can take 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.709
 photo left in your frame of fear I will 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.450
 take a picture there to shake 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.560
 trough 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:51.360
 there is here so she takes the photos 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.030
 without losing quality 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.370
 it was awesome awesome 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.769
 so then besides that you have a camera 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.540
 cool to do your filming 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.690
 you still have a super zoom for you 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.359
 Enjoy it if you go out on the street shooting things 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.810
 longes pick up things you would not get 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:13.530
 usually because it is close as it is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.410
 Far away, man, it's amazing is 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.910
 awesome what I said here with 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.370
 You guys, I thought it was cool. 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.590
 waiting for the full moon moment to 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.569
 So shoot that one then, just go back to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:35.489
 you have that notion of expensive distance 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.380
 Look at the moon, the short guy and 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.950
 professional pressures and more 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.440
 once so she gives a little bit like this 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.180
 the matter of a few seconds to pick up 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.660
 the focus that I'm shaking because you 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.880
 to shake the camera to have focus 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.459
 quickly 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.810
 The delay because it looks, it's already taking more 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.080
 Also in the daytime you have 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.590
 fast stuff 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.660
 tago 30 exaggerating nor taking moons that is 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.320
 any else 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.920
 toy dolls in x like i said goes up to 200 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.240
 putting 200 is ok at 0 x 0 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.600
 you can see all the imperfections 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.600
 Look, it just left port on the edge there. 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.810
 Let me go back a little, man. 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.030
 very good recommends a nice camera 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:31.230
 You can film and many things besides 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.230
 of the light moon 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.600
 and let me come back here then we 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.550
 hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.070
 is what to share this moment with 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.720
 You and I were asking what 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.180
 obliges the use of showing a little more the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.220
 skills and camera has other 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.140
 skills that do not show here in 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.520
