00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hello dear channel viewers 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.430
 repair 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 but we are starting a repair video loop 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.059
 Renault Megane 2 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.200
 Today we show the oil change on 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.370
 car renault megan 2 engine 16 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.810
 necessary before changing the oil 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.869
 warm up the engine to working 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 temperatures 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.099
 before you lift the car on 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 either put it on when clearly in front 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.300
 how to fill me up 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.970
 open the filler plug 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 so that we have a lot of better flow then 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.770
 raise the car and delivery raised 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.930
 car naturally remove protection 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:51.680
 crankcase and then here's a tetragon of 8 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.680
 millimeters unscrew the drain plug 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.940
 Well, substituting which yoox 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 take off 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 characteristic black oil hey this not 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:21.340
 need to be afraid 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:24.010
 she is always black now when we have 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.750
 open drain plug unscrew 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.780
 oil filter can be used here 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.640
 I adapt such they are sold to stores 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:39.760
 here is the original filter to change it better 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.410
 There is no access to the media at the top of the filter. 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.150
 the same 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.240
 then unscrew the drain 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:02:04.210
 cork open mass more glass from 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 us by osmosis as well as neatly now 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.229
 oil will flow 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.860
 it's flowing 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.710
 everything 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 now we merge while waiting for us though 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.840
 I wouldnâ€™t start digging, and if there 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.329
 shed necessarily remove leftovers 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.980
 weight 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.260
 before installing the oil filter 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.269
 preferably of course fill small 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.790
 the amount of oil 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:50.489
 filter itself and be sure to lubricate 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:52.500
 rubber seal and set 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.109
 also before installing the filter 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.700
 be sure to wipe the fitting 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:16.109
 where the seal will come 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:19.109
 and baiting delivery to tracks by 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.859
 maximum filter can live a little 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.530
 pull up 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.079
 also prerequisites if you will 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.419
 install original filter it does not 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:34.560
 so expensive and would save her too 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:37.430
 will fit much then we have enough 2 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.430
 place preload 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:04:11.110
 and then installing a new gasket on 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:14.800
 the drain plug baits and tightens well 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:20.430
 and after all this you can pour oil 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.930
 use a funnel oil pour 540 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.350
 originally 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.470
 excel mind nf we poured about 4 liters 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.230
 420 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:37.870
 Now we need to check on the probe 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:44.230
 feeler is here he will we see it 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:46.420
 we have a short warrior this mark 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.550
 the maximum of this is naturally the minimum he 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.160
 must be somewhere between not desirable 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.830
 Of course the middle is even slightly higher 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.320
 Well, just now pour oil 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.720
 surely the flat plane of the machines is not 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.350
 It should be level and topped up already 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.110
 level 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:11.170
 here after this after 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.690
 originally needed put up close 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.070
 Cork start the car until it goes out 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.680
 oil pressure light 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.120
 seconds five she worked deafening and 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.880
 wait for 5 minutes well and after you brought 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.980
 she worked by necessity 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.980
 add and set the level
