exploited it emotionally in fact he's

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
exploited it emotionally in fact he's
even<00:00:28.859> hidden<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> face<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.179> hero

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
right foot in the water you feel it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.720 
right foot in the water you feel it
dragging<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> way<00:02:20.800> it's<00:02:20.950> slowing<00:02:21.370> them

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.000 
dragging and the way it's slowing them
down<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:22.270> they<00:02:22.450> move<00:02:23.080> along<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.650> pulley

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
down is they move along this pulley

down is they move along this pulley
there's<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.730> real<00:02:25.060> sense<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.990> particular

that make this seem so immediate and I
love<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.070> way<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.580> water<00:02:30.790> drips<00:02:31.360> from<00:02:31.750> that

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
love the way that water drips from that
