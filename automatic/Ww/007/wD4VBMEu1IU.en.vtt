00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.730
 now we have to kill this kind of 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.900
 weird bugs 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.850
 at the head samurai does not have any 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 nothing but you know that I for 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.660
 the engines for a little original but 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.980
 hey me I like that's the important thing 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.409
 he knows about something important 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.909
 very important we go the attack of 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.280
 tornado because it is that if our vices 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:38.000
 they become too annoying points is 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.440
 that is too serious too much 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.280
 tell you that I told you that this weapon for 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.060
 clean the stage the stage was 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.610
 we are going to perfect and for reasons 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.200
 obvious is that it hits I do not know how many tics 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.270
 to the enemies and if you're a little 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.270
 skillful then the bust of a 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.040
 jerk okay they are uncle enemies is that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.290
 It is also curious that they fly over this way in 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.860
 fly plan cojonera you know a little more 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.380
 this is until they are defended by 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.100
 Mules thanks to the tornado that does not have 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.430
 limits 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.860
 then break them throwing milk and see 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.230
 valera censure already or little and I do not know if I 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.230
 Will they give me time if I'm lucky 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.070
 perfect and more is because this shield 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.170
 comes very well in his enemies kamikazes 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.030
 so that he does not push us do not make us 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.759
 some trick with the most platforms 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.950
 that nothing because those platforms is that 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.720
 it does not matter if you have that state in the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.880
 immunity when you receive a blow that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.290
 as it is more urgent for you to drip and 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 good apart that you see that he played them 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.729
 lasts until they break it and this area does not 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.500
 we are for some strange reason they are about 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.920
 Bugs that do not break your shield 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.610
 touch him 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.890
 so it can be constantly 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.990
 annihilating every living thing 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.990
 and these platforms really 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.840
 I do not know, I do not do this. 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.910
 have to go jumping and give 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 quickly up so he can hold on to 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.209
 the stairs is a very rare thing for 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.209
 my boy 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.300
 and the most complicated I get the first 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.140
 is that this is for pissing and not 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.140
 leave motives 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.659
 and this has been a little clever you have 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.010
 seen that there is a container of life there 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.439
 basically until we have the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.490
 boomerang can not put it so 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.250
 we completely forget about him 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.120
 with care this area more than anything is 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.370
 for cool it was for the simple moment and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.010
 case that the blows do not make us 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.780
 some shit they reappear 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.350
 bugs and like that does not benefit us 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.570
 we thank the tornado Lord 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.100
 the cabal point I left them when 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.550
 jump I give it up so that it 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.550
 hitch 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.930
 but he's still here the stairs with 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.120
 a normal jump I think 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.500
 Let's see 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.690
 that at least we have to put the 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.340
 missile launchers the missiles you know 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.930
 we unlock with the pulpit 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.480
 This live is not very difficult to kill 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.250
 and less with the missiles but the 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.329
 fogging promises against the ceiling 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.010
 Come on, it's apotheosis 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.010
 good some hits 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.530
 hit me I was not hooked and I threw myself 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.530
 ceiling 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.630
 and with these gentlemen we got the super 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:04.930
 and sensual boomerang that is going to come 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.459
 we thought that neither I ever think 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.689
 of the weapons necessary to defeat 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.689
 some of the finals 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.489
 so let's see if I'm going to do it in 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.049
 the total part I want me to remember 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.519
 ok is that I remember a couple that 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.949
 I could get with the boomerang but 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.690
 stop counting worth one of them is 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.610
 Obviously I remember this because 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.870
 obvious reasons since I go through the 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.880
 area and there's no better after that 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.550
 There were quite a few more and I do not remember 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.949
 where are they or how did I have to get to 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.599
 it's a little bit let's go I'm going to take the 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.580
 that I remember and then out of 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.530
 camera and take whatever it takes 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.689
 yes the bad thing about this is that you have to 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.849
 again almost until the end of 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.490
 scenario something that is not exactly 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.509
 simple sends balls and now I do not receive 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.759
 damage in that area 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.740
 well you will see that it is very easy to receive 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.379
 I'll call if you're fast and dodge a 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.360
 little bit like I do not eat anything and 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.919
 Adame as the most obvious is a two 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.919
 hits double ration 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.890
 that's the fact that I think I'm going to 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:21.360
 have to do more than gavÃ  because no no 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:25.230
 having the tornado produces me a there like 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.640
 like a very strange fear not because it is not 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.410
 the successful tornado wrote that he used it 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.660
 little less than when he used it is that 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.270
 well from now on what 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.830
 I will use far more than the 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.020
 scenarios that played now as well as 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.020
 that were nothing special 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.580
 I say it seriously less badly than the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.860
 shield is responsible for bursting what is 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.669
 says to each and every one of the enemies 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.780
 that come out of the way mother of God 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.780
 how well it has turned out that 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.060
 I am delivered mega more without super this saga 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.139
 Let's see 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.139
 the last 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:21.119
 it's funny but let's go super fast 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:23.860
 of sakhir was more or less perfect 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:26.289
 morbidly you see two lines more than not 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.789
 it will save our lives but if you reveal 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.559
 all life containers 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.249
 Obviously it can save you from many 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:32.249
 very cool things 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.340
 the monkey was true where I could 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.720
 get a potion if I remember correctly 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.380
 that you are again like I get it because 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.380
 I do not remember anymore 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.850
 but good 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.070
 even by the beginning zone something 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.699
 I'm going to favor them a lot 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.699
 there is 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.200
 if it does not arrive and if it does not arrive with attack 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.490
 loaded the boomerang 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.490
 she can not have caught 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.980
 no miracles anymore how the sky was made 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.450
 I agree under 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:18.230
 what is the music of this scenario is 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.230
 just that it leaves me too zombie 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.080
 so I have to take the boomerang that 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.949
 I was jumping to the best 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.949
 so it does not work out 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:35.400
 fuck to see with the love of satan how 

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:37.259
 I was uncle 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.620
 sure it is the biggest nonsense ever 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:39.620
 costume 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.940
 no 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:50.180
 and then it would be free 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.080
 I shit on God said was the nonsense 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.080
 largest in the world 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:08:01.460
 I'm awesome dude my god that 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.460
 fuck my god my god my god 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.550
 I hope you liked it and if so 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.620
 you already know how to comment on their lives 

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.750
 layers with all the most important thank you 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.960
 for following me goodbye and being happy very 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.960
 years
