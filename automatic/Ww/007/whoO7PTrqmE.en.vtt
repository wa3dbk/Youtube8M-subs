00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
and stuff now our tutorial that's what

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.650 
and stuff now our tutorial that's what
I'm<00:00:41.520> basically<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> show<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> how<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I'm basically going to show you how to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.030 
I'm basically going to show you how to
play<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.500> don't<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.920> need

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
play right now so I don't think we need

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
play right now so I don't think we need
to<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.550> stats<00:00:44.969> shows<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> high

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to go do that stats shows you the high

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
to go do that stats shows you the high
score<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.890> average<00:00:47.219> score<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> most<00:00:48.539> likely

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
score the average score the most likely

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
score the average score the most likely
to<00:00:49.110> crash<00:00:49.320> airplanes<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.039> I'll<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to crash airplanes and I'll get to you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.930 
to crash airplanes and I'll get to you
that<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.940> later<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.340> this<00:00:53.340> game<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.610> basically

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that all later so this game is basically

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
that all later so this game is basically
once<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> hit<00:00:54.960> play<00:00:55.110> you'll<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> little

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
once you hit play you'll see a little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
once you hit play you'll see a little
airport<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.180> you'll<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.719> three

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
airport like this you'll see three

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
airport like this you'll see three
runways<00:00:58.469> actually<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.730> helicopter

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
runways actually two and a helicopter

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.119 
runways actually two and a helicopter
pad<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.559> an<00:01:01.620> airplane<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pad so as you can see an airplane is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
pad so as you can see an airplane is
approaching<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.699> airport<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.170> is

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
approaching the airport all you do is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.880 
approaching the airport all you do is
tap<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.330> drag<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> runway<00:01:07.049> smec

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
tap it and drag it into the runway smec

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
tap it and drag it into the runway smec
it<00:01:08.100> has<00:01:08.220> colors<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> correspond<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it has colors that correspond it to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630 
it has colors that correspond it to
which<00:01:09.540> runway<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> needs<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> land<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.490> look

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
which runway it needs to land to so look

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
which runway it needs to land to so look
there's<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> red<00:01:12.240> plane<00:01:12.479> pregnant<00:01:13.320> there's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
there's a red plane pregnant there's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
there's a red plane pregnant there's
another<00:01:14.100> red<00:01:14.280> plane<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> these<00:01:15.390> planes<00:01:15.659> are

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
another red plane and these planes are

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.179 
another red plane and these planes are
coming<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.320> fast<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> basic

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
coming in really fast so the basic

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
coming in really fast so the basic
objective<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.119> land<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.509> many<00:01:21.780> planes

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
objective is just to land as many planes

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.039 
objective is just to land as many planes
as<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:23.030> without<00:01:24.030> getting<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.689> crash

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
as you can without getting them crash

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
as you can without getting them crash
and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.590> I'll<00:01:25.799> show<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.340> means

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and then I'll show you what that means

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.550 
and then I'll show you what that means
so<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.509> I'll<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.049> drag<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:30.560> see

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so see I'll just drag it there see

so see I'll just drag it there see
there's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.799> yellow<00:01:31.950> plane<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.400> drag<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> into

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
there's a yellow plane we drag it into

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
there's a yellow plane we drag it into
the<00:01:33.030> yellow<00:01:33.240> runway<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> notice<00:01:37.380> here

the yellow runway and as you notice here
as<00:01:37.740> two<00:01:37.950> planes<00:01:38.310> start<00:01:38.759> getting<00:01:39.000> close<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
as two planes start getting close to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
as two planes start getting close to
each<00:01:39.390> other<00:01:39.450> notice<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> red<00:01:40.200> points<00:01:40.500> they

each other notice the red points they
start<00:01:41.450> turning<00:01:42.450> red<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.840> oh<00:01:42.990> look<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:43.710> crash

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
start turning red and oh look they crash

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
start turning red and oh look they crash
so<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> means<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.570> over<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.350> crash

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so that means game over if you crash

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280 
so that means game over if you crash
once<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> lose<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.240> basic<00:01:48.689> objective<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
once you lose so the basic objective is

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
once you lose so the basic objective is
to<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.920> crash<00:01:50.130> points<00:01:50.520> online<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.909> many<00:01:51.149> as

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to not crash points online as many as

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
to not crash points online as many as
possible<00:01:51.509> minus<00:01:52.380> 41<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:53.460> pretty<00:01:53.729> sure<00:01:53.850> some

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
possible minus 41 I'm pretty sure some

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990 
possible minus 41 I'm pretty sure some
people<00:01:54.240> compete<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.909> just<00:01:56.909> don't

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
people compete that but I just don't

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660 
people compete that but I just don't
have<00:01:57.090> enough<00:01:57.240> time<00:01:57.509> um<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.250> probably<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
have enough time um this is probably the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.920 
have enough time um this is probably the
best<00:01:59.880> game<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.329> I've<00:02:00.420> downloaded<00:02:00.630> from
