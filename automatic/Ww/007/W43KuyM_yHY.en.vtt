00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.960
 Welcome to my next florian 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.930
 we are happy to do the theme blazing there 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.820
 I have him as reinforcements give them 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.640
 brought to relationship and lies 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.990
 together means stores we will contact 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 make a few panzer 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 and with our every good neck 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.079
 so 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.630
 and be approached for this 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.340
 divide 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 from Friday 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.850
 efron 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.490
 we switch with us 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.490
 the pilots 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.760
 however, before 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.690
 first we have ourselves 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.399
 this was the mode for the head pages 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.399
 then be on the control 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.360
 here the function 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.930
 have only our readers just because 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.500
 we here 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.870
 he earns the laser bread with the laser 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.770
 departure and basically we have the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:26.950
 laser bread for the ea sports abbreviated 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.950
 xss the function then uses worthless 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 laser beam editorial takes up with 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.680
 the return button back to the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.820
 hard times , let's have a look 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.820
 as best as possible 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.509
 as our fourth where 12 the laser herb 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.960
 is already set we leave now 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.960
 even so 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.110
 put on our day 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.649
 these emissions are actually burning 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.649
 start 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.590
 and we prepare the goals once 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.250
 we are approaching the target look at our 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.940
 chat communicate from another 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.700
 corner 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.250
 we make ourselves 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.040
 Italy comes to the right to our 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.060
 view 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.549
 two augusta where it was pretty much everyone 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.599
 post did not switch and there 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.599
 we have against Panzer 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.350
 something in and switch 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.580
 and why 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.120
 we make the goal for the first the whole 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:58.310
 namely the need we have this spd now 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 on our tadschiken thomas koppe 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.530
 look back on our days the pott 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.850
 Here we have the attitude for us 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.440
 laser 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.510
 now also switch to 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.510
 the laser and in bicycle 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.770
 but let always laser and through 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.280
 the control function operated 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.390
 once our big gestures the laser 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.780
 represent 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.780
 queried 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.400
 the goal 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.980
 [Music] 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 that was the reader with the Seehotel 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.260
 she is here now we turn on 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.080
 our first squeeze that we are all ourselves 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.240
 Do not shed the pump silver 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.240
 and we'll open it up 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.980
 there he is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.980
 frame can 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.300
 just 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:19.340
 Let's just go now 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:24.320
 we see the bomb the reflection 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.230
 has captured right now and on the target 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.540
 1 turns we switch back to the cockpit 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.960
 because the four weeks are still there at 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.100
 second that our goal 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.100
 [Music] 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.189
 mpeg trusted shops 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:47.309
 and that you see that also from the 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:49.379
 the other side is working out here 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:54.529
 now the next target with the laser 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:58.039
 firing and here a bomb on it 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:01.259
 first time practiced harry j 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.789
 That's important with laser swatch 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.930
 he can even catch the reader 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.979
 and the 6th 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.990
 right field of view so that the day the 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.120
 pott on our airplane a bigger one 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.120
 area absolutely can 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:27.440
 the u12 are us would be as a profile 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.440
 ccp 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.510
 because I like the whole thing 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.050
 then ready in a little bit 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.050
 start 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.199
 we are there also occurred this time 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.809
 she will see that here with the laser 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.809
 fire and we will be a woman 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.139
 dorsten 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.180
 too late that was the command that she 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:07.190
 the target is now actively fired 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:13.450
 a pity and now we 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:16.040
 6 jason scott search and now we have 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.190
 you look at the question of the lot 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.140
 between and done and the reflection 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.600
 tries to understand now has the 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.550
 search now has the technology there 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.740
 we hit the target and now a hit 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.880
 Followed that here we can with 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.880
 me and still tackle 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.050
 now are due to their being 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.419
 and fly the target 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.620
 Here we are, ie we can 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.620
 just stay on level 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.180
 in the morning 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.610
 hobby 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.449
 changed 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.900
 then to day, we are now going one 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.900
 a little bit pale 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.560
 gomez can 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.470
 such a bomb is gone you see it here 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:17.289
 I do not actively laser ab fire that makes 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:24.210
 she for us and we will look again 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:26.470
 Bomb to now distracts the bomb 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.050
 down there we can already see the tank 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.720
 stand 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:34.550
 we switch back to the cockpit 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.910
 5 cents to the rear 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.910
 OK 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.930
 is perhaps have 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.530
 well know 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.530
 better on 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:51.870
 OK 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.150
 We are pleased that he has watched 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.990
 and see you in the next tutorial 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.990
 to 3
