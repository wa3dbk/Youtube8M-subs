circuit than six and seven now is left
right<00:00:57.359> before<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.980> left<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.030> we'll

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
right before was a right left and we'll

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.170 
right before was a right left and we'll
have<00:01:00.410> one<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.769> long<00:01:02.039> straight<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.699> hey

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
have one very long straight now hey

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.469 
have one very long straight now hey
heading<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> terminate<00:01:04.500> very<00:01:04.949> heavy<00:01:05.220> braking

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479

under the bridge bumpy breaking first
chicane<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.780> circuit<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.410> right

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
chicane of the circuit and i was right

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.940 
chicane of the circuit and i was right
left<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.610> again<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.330> very<00:01:12.600> long<00:01:12.869> straight<00:01:13.740> out

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
left and again a very long straight out

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
left and again a very long straight out
of<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.310> chicane<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> need<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.509> clean<00:01:15.750> exit

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of this chicane so you need a clean exit

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.910 
of this chicane so you need a clean exit
of<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.550> is<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.789> low<00:01:17.970> slowest<00:01:18.920> corner

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
of this this is the low slowest corner

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
of this this is the low slowest corner
of<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.310> circuit<00:01:20.700> 10<00:01:20.940> 10<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.450> lot<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.740> spectators

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
of the circuit 10 10 a lot of spectators

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
of the circuit 10 10 a lot of spectators
there<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.190> we're<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.030> around<00:01:24.180> 300

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
there and we're right around 300

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
there and we're right around 300
kilometers<00:01:25.380> malware<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> corner

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
kilometers malware and we do the corner

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.600 
kilometers malware and we do the corner
around<00:01:26.850> 45<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:27.990> soft<00:01:28.259> opponent<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:29.549> we

around 45 so very soft opponent now we

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
around 45 so very soft opponent now we
