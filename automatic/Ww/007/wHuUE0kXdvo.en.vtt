00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 because here it is pro and welcome to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.779
 first spectator duel with castor now 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.700
 Let's go 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 ok I have not mean 30 seconds but 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.029
 no problem ok m 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.260
 I would like to see that at the beginning 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.260
 not so bad 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 So as you can see the games black 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 wing a slightly different version because so 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.820
 Well, no one plays this card though 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.620
 I already have a reason why I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 that's why I play it too 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 I'll put up with just the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.170
 and and that and then that should 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.149
 actually enough 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.969
 as far as I know, callisto cyber plays 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:57.989
 kites and that this could help 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.940
 in any case, so in any case 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.040
 I have to look at the kite boat ecartec 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.640
 me there 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 If I have something against it then I have it 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.970
 OK 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.049
 OK 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.049
 if that can already activate 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.450
 good question I can ask a question 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 whoever is there is someone there the spectator 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.310
 what is he doing right now okay okay 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 well we have a spectator 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.540
 okay because i did it that way i did 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.170
 will post on facebook 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 if i play with us like that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.670
 to you and today that was today and now 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.100
 then we meet in a chatroom 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 and then we can figure things out 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.630
 what could be now he could be up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.990
 to have every case in the country 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.350
 and then that would be a relatively short one 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350
 duel 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:22.490
 I hope you have no lance because otherwise 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:28.980
 that has been left now 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.670
 he has a lance he has one or he 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.830
 has no 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.830
 good good then goes the duel but further 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.120
 okay then we stopped that because 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.590
 that would be in any case 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.790
 and no matter and in the hurt 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.780
 no problem that is very good 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.410
 that is very good 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.670
 Okay, let's start now I'll show you 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.410
 why I play this one 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.610
 that's funny, that's me 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 May the special complain when I enter 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:09.320
 control game and this is one 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:12.120
 receiver and then it looks like this 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.320
 yes I have the freedom and have 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.620
 build a picture of the black winglet 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.620
 pretty nice 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:32.730
 if it works and sees it 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:35.010
 Pretty good because black birds 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.359
 everything is the monster and the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.689
 have a level four tuner and i can 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.819
 Simply summon drill and there 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.530
 does this work 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.700
 that's pretty nice i have though 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.430
 now taken harm when intervened 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.780
 but he will not not appear 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.750
 He then gets attacked permanently 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.970
 So that's not bad at all 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.650
 bad I actually still had 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.180
 but that could be specific 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.750
 nothing brought and vario brings me 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.310
 nothing 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:07.920
 that's why i'll just attack then 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.879
 I will destroy it and that is 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.130
 bitter my ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.810
 yes and I do not even have one here 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.910
 I even have one for the case that 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.180
 that happens again is not 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:31.370
 bad good now appears where mine 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.370
 god i could play black hole 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.360
 Ok, now it's called 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 Wow 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:06.740
 last words I want to attack now 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.500
 i want to seize it though i could 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.560
 fight foreigners have 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.160
 There I will attack with mushrooms 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.590
 and with that I won 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.560
 a very nice example of mushrooms was 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.350
 she can have everything on it 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.750
 and yes that was game number 1 of the 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.979
 spectators are dueling 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.060
 if you want to play against me 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.130
 then in any case mine 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.389
 Inscriptions when I enter the video 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.979
 I am glad then my 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.630
 Thumbs up a comment and 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.770
 maybe even an abo that but the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.770
