00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690
 leontis, too 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 jo i'm also here at the start where i am 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.180
 me just about the pc because you would have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 it in the ass and I have only the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 microphones in the pc I feel stuck 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.989
 me like his sakko definitely 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.400
 here double-double nuclear meter with one 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.310
 everything is standard 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 ability images bullet proof vest 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.830
 everything pipapo and thus clearly against the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.509
 biggest tops what's in xbox live what 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.060
 I've actually ever seen this here 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.340
 for example, this one so that you 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 really really bad opponents on 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.100
 every case but conclusion confirmed 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.540
 you do not always see that and yes I do 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 just wanted something very short 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.259
 we had previously announced 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 made a try and then until 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.340
 to forget 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.650
 with our due date leon do you want there 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.509
 Just say something so yes me 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.100
 I remember so suggested for 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.020
 to do my trades because they are 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.939
 alone is a bit boring 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.320
 No time I said yes hardly 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.270
 let's make one together 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.740
 We 'll think about it now 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.820
 somewhere a so look for the one 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.939
 bit edited 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.579
 but think yourself and look 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.479
 because winning is going to be really awesome 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.450
 to send youtube 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 thanks out and just whole yourself up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 dry imprint on you yes to everyone 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.489
 fall together so here I have 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.140
 actually my montage already done 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.580
 but now I have a great receipt 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 found and that is now that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.080
 now five again 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.390
 good and my montage against actually 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 so three minutes, that's why we will 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 so of course everything is new again 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.860
 cut and so and then that will be the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.710
 absolute mind montage was there you can 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.000
 make you ready i hope my micro 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.440
 is good because somehow this is here 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.780
 just grab matter 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.160
 In any case, that will come as 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 next video from me 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.390
 after these comments to a few 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.150
 I do not know exactly when I have it 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.930
 a lot around the ears and jalet and wants so 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.280
 Just say what it is today 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.690
 So today the theme was the three 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 hdl bull team 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.420
 or will she attack underbody? 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.820
 appeal so that one can be anything 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.670
 So I think I think they are 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.840
 it is so well known so people this one 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.070
 have a bit of gaming experience themselves 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.950
 a bit know that too easy 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.020
 expensive there is actually so to speak 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.850
 yourself which 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.220
 I mean, if you find in everyone 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.140
 lobby on the xbox is really bad 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.610
 find it in any lobby any 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.650
 German Be then there too 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.870
 that's that's the critical that 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.880
 if the adversaries stay that way 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.820
 that excites me right when the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.050
 then try abstract and then like that 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.300
 send voice message messages where 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.060
 They then claim here that I am 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.830
 better than you and etc he is absolute 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.700
 This is just extreme 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.160
 It is ridiculous last time accident 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.620
 can you tell me sometime and somehow 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.239
 yes multi team played and then have 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.610
 we just invited black ops 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.800
 land where was that believing black now 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.390
 ops 1 meur 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.920
 his son has a right around her 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.820
 bullied said he is better and 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.470
 everything and not easy at all 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.030
 it was definitely somehow i did 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.640
 The cathedral does not matter to anyone 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.860
 fall right really ridiculous so you 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.810
 Often applies to such last time 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.190
 example, we have on the cooling 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.709
 clan pushed rex so and ec red and me 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.730
 do not know what smoke I know it 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.100
 it does not matter 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.799
 In any case, we have the lobby 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.090
 tasted and then they came in 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.519
 they did not go out that did 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.690
 really excited because she herself 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.190
 complains about two years though 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.460
 Do not go out there because German 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.080
 players and 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.400
 I do not have any afterwards 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.780
 voice message or message sent 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.229
 because I really like the show 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.569
 videos like to go from you website then 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.830
 just send a message sent 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.380
 played well and then I stop 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.500
 also friendship cetera and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.060
 so and that was then already clear was 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.590
 that excites me personally even if 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.880
 you know each other that way 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.680
 if one remains in it that goes 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.180
 Not at all because every second lobby 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.759
 that you have any people in it me 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.430
 in the friend list from time to time at 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.979
 you often hear it so many hear it 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.210
 many savvy people in the st yes me 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.430
 I somehow under German you saw 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.139
 somehow the americans are the 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.120
 they make this ami community 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.080
 it's also happy last the die 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.400
 Most of them know each other that way 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.949
 there is somehow there with each other 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.139
 which in the unpack the but in there 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.580
 Simply unique in Germany I have 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.410
 times one invited so can you please 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.539
 go out and rather no why should 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.550
 I or only such sayings get there 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.280
 head that the place if you right the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.680
 collar talks is not that's it 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.330
 that was the first time it was before two three 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.550
 days as well as you have witnessed 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.400
 and then where we here somehow named 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.190
 him like waynes or something anyway 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.830
 the names are 1000 times on youtube 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.210
 xbox live and he also has three multi 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.889
 played team and they have just right 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.900
 violently to get the chance so 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.699
 they all had - Katie and he were 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.370
 half still remained there because he has 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.590
 then claimed that made him fun 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.969
 So stay that way so do not do it 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.949
 just ridiculous I do not know 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.960
 which is fun if you are right 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.159
 get on the snout and who does not 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.199
 that's just just for the sake of it 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.580
 pack guys if you do that 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.870
 so does not make something that's just 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.599
 ridiculous that's just poor 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.340
 is just childish simply does me 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.800
 the fallen is right on the xbox 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.169
 extremely not so on the ps3 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.669
 that in de all a bit one 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.669
 I say something funny 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.050
 and yes i do not know what i say 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.830
 should still tell me what the role of one 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.500
 slowly the end 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.849
 how long have we still so yes I know 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.419
 not in the minute 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:30.210
 yes I have set myself now far 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.770
 so from the 8 6 so a birthday there have 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.510
 a bit of playstation sitting there 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.569
 I get a playstation 3 again 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.179
 and then 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.050
 I would say yes then there is martin 

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:42.289
 schweiger 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.669
 well true yes ps3 me right 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.529
 have now seen the comparison on 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.969
 the ps3 I find the direct 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.979
 comparatively gives on the ps3 correctly 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.599
 really violent players really 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.639
 fierce the multi team plays to 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:56.209
 example but it is also the comparison 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.999
 with multi team the player indicator like that 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:03.229
 See the multi team playing ps3 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:07.069
 5000 last time, for example, and xbox fans 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.599
 only 500 for example that was already that 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.789
 the already extreme because different then 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:13.520
 just hit ps3 on the bigger ones 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:16.430
 groups are on the ps3 the right 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.439
 hard gameplay that is just like that 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.819
 the xbox he is not the case 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:22.039
 but there I have now, for example 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:23.689
 sometimes it's against the right ups 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.180
 different times to clarify that is 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:29.959
 There are everywhere on both platforms 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.459
 but xbox ps3 time a bit more extreme 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:33.349
 yes, that was mine and that was it 

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.019
 Leon I say only one thing to earth 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:37.339
 Remember me on ps3 from the new account there 

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:40.819
 Everything is in the video description 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:44.409
 leon you have the last word yes ok guys 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.409
 Get in and do it well
