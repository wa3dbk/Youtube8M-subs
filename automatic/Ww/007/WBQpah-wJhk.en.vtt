I<00:02:14.970> got<00:02:15.970> something<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.660> bag<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.819> put<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.660> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
I got something in a bag and I put it on

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.699 
I got something in a bag and I put it on
a<00:02:19.810> log<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.270> they<00:02:22.270> get<00:02:22.480> with<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> with<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
a log and they get with the with the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.280 
a log and they get with the with the
pole<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.099> my<00:02:24.220> tomahawk<00:02:24.780> until<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:25.959> really

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
pole of my tomahawk until it was really

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.940 
pole of my tomahawk until it was really
soft

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
soft

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.990 
soft
I<00:02:28.020> did<00:02:29.020> try<00:02:29.260> striking<00:02:29.770> sparks<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.400> event<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I did try striking sparks in event and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.970 
I did try striking sparks in event and
it<00:02:31.120> didn't<00:02:31.540> take<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.760> player<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.300> charted<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
it didn't take the player I charted and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.839 
it didn't take the player I charted and
indeed<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.930> that's<00:02:38.819> that's<00:02:39.819> another<00:02:40.030> tinder

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
indeed so that's that's another tinder

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.300 
indeed so that's that's another tinder
you<00:02:42.849> can<00:02:43.030> use
