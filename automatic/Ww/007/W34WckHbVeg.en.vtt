00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.360
 flower growers dream of plants 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 long blooming and preserving 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.489
 its decorative after flowering 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.170
 landscape designers love plants 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.010
 textured from which you can create 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.780
 large beautiful spots in the garden is desirable 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.960
 green lands that would 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.620
 they pleased us both in the spring and in the deep 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.300
 the fall of such plants is not really 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.220
 very much but they are 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.829
 To one of such plants belong 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.300
 geykhera this plant 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.690
 suddenly became very fashionable and popular 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.810
 due to the fact that in recent years 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.740
 breeders have created a huge amount 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.280
 new varieties with stunningly beautiful 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 foliage coloring with varied 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.910
 blooms of different heights 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.930
 different leaf plate actually 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.240
 this plant is not a new name geyhery 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.790
 it was given by carl linney 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 that is, but you can imagine age 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.750
 plants and his name was given in honor 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.420
 professors of medicine and botany 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.140
 john geyher sometimes write high sierra 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.479
 his year of birth is 1677 that is, you can 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.119
 imagine how long ago we are in general 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.420
 familiar with this plant plant 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.130
 refers to a family of stones is lacquer 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.340
 the family is quite worthy in and of itself 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.100
 This correlates for the given and astilbe 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.970
 astilba and des about epaulets and saxifrages 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.500
 actually and here's one of them 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.950
 geykhera 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.929
 plant area of ​​its natural 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.079
 distribution is northern 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.500
 America rather the western part of the north 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.840
 America and more precisely Mexico each 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.120
 amateur grower wants to create for 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.870
 her birth conditions such that she 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 pleased him with her beauty 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.549
 health over the years 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.520
 what is needed for this we are very 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.410
 often do not know where it is geykher we do not 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.069
 we know not only the kind from which 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.829
 it happened we fix it 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.139
 what kind of hybrid is this geykher 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.719
 often we don’t even know the name of it 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.700
 varieties like that we acquired because of us 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.590
 very often as amateur flower growers 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.349
 interested in the sort we like itself 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.609
 plant and his name is up to whatever we want so 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.889
 let's call so I do much easier 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.780
 Chihiro at a young age especially 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.870
 divided very easily first and hero 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.379
 consists of a rhizomatous plant which 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.469
 has long petioled leaves and 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.049
 create a rosette of these sockets 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.209
 maybe a little maybe a lot in 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.189
 3 four year old of these outlets 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.739
 there may be up to several 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:24.389
 dozens and bush acquires dimensions to 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.489
 40 60 centimeters so here in the young 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.159
 Geicher's age is very well divided 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.260
 as soon as geykhery gets into my garden 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.510
 my collection is new I try it though 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.969
 it would be easy to share in a year 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.120
 it takes root quite simply and I 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.829
 by experiment 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.560
 planting the same variety in different 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.560
 garden places look where better where 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.479
 more comfortable and so myself 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.239
 I set the habitat of this SR 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.769
 here so perhaps by experience can 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.259
 determine what you need 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.069
 but what is the general rule as I grow 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:02.579
 Geyher I have it grows where with 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.250
 one side is the hottest clock and and 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.909
 covers buildings from the midday sun 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.109
 and in the morning it is consecrated by direct sunny 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.500
 rays she feels fine there 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.060
 There is a little difficulty with the SRs 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.750
 yellow orange in these 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.400
 plants 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.940
 little chlorophyll so they are very fast 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.990
 evaporate moisture and require additional 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.360
 shading 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.800
 and maybe more abundant watering 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.919
 again without stagnant moisture without 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.349
 waterlogging 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.270
 I'm for such a geyher I have one 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.830
 a variety that is with me a long time ago 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.750
 waves and how i said that he and not 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.240
 grows and does not die that is not happy 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.580
 I have been looking for me with my appearance 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.900
 for him the place and finally found me 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.500
 there is a partition on which 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.250
 does she follow clematis and that's behind this 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.570
 easy tracery shadow of my geykhera became 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.400
 just unrecognizable 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:05.910
 as for soil fertility and that soil 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.639
 must be nutritious but also not 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.810
 overdo it because it's 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.500
 decorative leaf geyher and if you 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.870
 overfeed especially nitrogen will be a lot 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.750
 foliage and will be pulled they will not 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.660
 so decorative ie if you are 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.030
 refueled the soil before planting and 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.240
 it is desirable to fill a well-smoked 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.410
 manure is very good to add 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.970
 baking powder and 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.180
 i.e. it might be good 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.240
 rotten peat is good forest about fathers 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.820
 thoroughly some kind of well-smoked 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.060
 straw and if you refueled such 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.070
 organic here 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.580
 loose mixture of your kidney then 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.990
 additional dressing geyhera 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.949
 practically does not need very well 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.320
 for geykhery give dressing halls 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.900
 firstly this hall is very soft 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.419
 deoxidize and secondly 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.300
 Hall is a rich set of trace elements 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:10.210
 it is potassium which increases winter hardiness 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:15.820
 ash and sulfur plants 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.949
 can be fed from 1 to 3 times per season 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.919
 I add about one adult 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:24.220
 plant one two tablespoons of the halls and 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.740
 and collapsed but you need to loosen very 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.979
 carefully because superficial 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.960
 sucks suction roots in kefir and 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.190
 they are very close to the surface 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.020
 land does not hurt and do not harm kefir 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.870
 feed with ashes and after that and and 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.010
 liberally water it 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.010
 and very good
