with this primer it comes a lot of
claims<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.180> guess<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> reason<00:01:24.810> why

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
claims and I guess that's the reason why

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.499 
claims and I guess that's the reason why
this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.409> very<00:01:25.650> highly<00:01:25.920> requested<00:01:26.509> review

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and I guess that's also the reason why a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.249 
and I guess that's also the reason why a
lot<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.090> bloggers<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> YouTube's<00:01:30.869> haven't
