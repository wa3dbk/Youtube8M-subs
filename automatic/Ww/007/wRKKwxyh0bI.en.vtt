00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.470
 if you found on the Internet of interest 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.429
 you note an article or just some 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.320
 text fragment 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.959
 you can always save it 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.969
 this is done in exactly the same way as 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.610
 and when working in any text document 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.820
 using the mouse we select that fragment 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.650
 the text that we need, that is, we 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.320
 just click the left mouse button in 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.509
 the beginning of this text and enter the pointer 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.109
 mouse to the end of the text that us 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.089
 interested in 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.950
 after that we just need to click 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.260
 right mouse button to 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.750
 call the context menu from the context 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.610
 menu choose copy option now we 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.860
 can run any program in 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.390
 which we want to insert this text 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 for example, it may be a program 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.469
 notepad respectively now we 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.359
 use the clipboard so you 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.050
 call the context menu by clicking the right 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.809
 click in a free area 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.309
 document and say insert here 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.660
 only text was inserted that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.239
 In this case, I had it inserted in 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.330
 line if we open the program now 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:10.270
 word pad go to all programs 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.580
 standard and run wordpad and now 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.009
 always put our text exactly the same 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.830
 we are already in the form of such 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.079
 paragraphs of the text further with this inserted 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.420
 text we can work principle 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.430
 arbitrarily in the same way as 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 when creating a plain text 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.820
 of the document 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.479
 that is, we can edit the text or 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.479
 format it there in bold 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.149
 italicized underlined change for example 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.560
 color and so on, that is all we are talking about 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.689
 already talked to you when 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.180
 considered the word pad program 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.719
 if we need to save any 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.369
 let's find an image for example 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.740
 any image you can go 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.780
 to the website 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.009
 home page there usually 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.020
 there is some image 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.540
 Well, for example, there is an image of the day 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.729
 here is some if we want this 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.100
 image save, in principle, no 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.689
 nothing is easier click the right button 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.509
 mouse on the image and causing 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.020
 context menu and here we need 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.700
 select the option to save the picture as 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.700
 after that we open 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.350
 standard save window where we are 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.990
 can we 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.910
 choose the folder where we are given 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.470
 image can save for example 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.050
 can choose desktop 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.860
 here you can change the name of this 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.570
 Images 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.210
 Yes, that is, you can for example leave 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.640
 Only this is the name and click 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.680
 save button as you see this 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.790
 my image was saved 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.920
 if now Iâ€™ll shut all the windows, then I 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.020
 I see on the desktop and if now 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.610
 double clicked on it then she told me 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.680
 open in the viewer 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.290
 I can work with this image already 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.569
 since i need to add it for example 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.999
 to your text document 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.790
 and there is another trick about which I 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.829
 I want to tell you when going by 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.870
 hyperlinks on web pages new 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.599
 page can be loaded as in the same 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.219
 tab itself as current so in 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.069
 new tab that will allow you to have 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.719
 direct access to two pages 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.900
 page load when going to 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.560
 The hyperlink is usually determined by the author. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.780
 pages 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.510
 but you can always open the page in 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.280
 A new tab look for example if I 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.669
 Now I will go to any hyperlink 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.370
 here is my page 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.919
 opens in the same tab if 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.569
 I'd like to open this reference in 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.790
 a new tab then one could do 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.129
 as follows you hover 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.370
 click on the hyperlink you want 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.829
 go and press the left mouse button 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.159
 and the wheel is the fact that the wheel 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.599
 besides the scrolling function which we 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.299
 already talked up then there are functions 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.719
 scrolling when you spin the wheel 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.030
 and 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.489
 with the wheel you can move 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.959
 on the page up down so here's the wheel 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.000
 except this function still has 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.250
 ability to click accordingly 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.449
 we have the function of 3 buttons on the mouse 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.099
 if i now I will bring on some 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:08.519
 hyperlink mouse pointer and click 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.989
 mouse wheel then you see what I have 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.849
 It opened another vkladochka I 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.389
 This page has remained in its 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.250
 tab and this hyperlink loaded 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.070
 page in a new tab and now i have 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.349
 Direct access to two web pages. 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.729
 This is a very handy feature and I will tell you 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.729
 I recommend using it
