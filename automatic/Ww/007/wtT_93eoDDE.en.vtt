00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.630 
obviously David's coming down which team
and<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:02.990> know<00:02:03.110> very<00:02:03.140> much<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.619> reporter<00:02:04.130> how

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
different you think your style is to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.630 
different you think your style is to
David<00:02:07.159> style<00:02:07.460> probably<00:02:08.450> very<00:02:08.630> much<00:02:08.810> different

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
David's approach would be very very

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.800 
David's approach would be very very
serious<00:02:12.830> but<00:02:13.310> when<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.880> details<00:02:14.209> come<00:02:14.420> out<00:02:14.569> as

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
serious but when the details come out as
