expect it to based on what they're
familiar<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.579> 4.1<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.930> going

familiar with and 4.1 we're just going

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.069 
familiar with and 4.1 we're just going
to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.440> better<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.219> all<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.079> to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
to do it better that's all so to

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.709 
to do it better that's all so to
illustrate<00:00:43.200> them<00:00:44.180> something<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.450> aware<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
illustrate them something to be aware of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.170 
illustrate them something to be aware of
is<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> mp3<00:00:46.590> file<00:00:46.829> format<00:00:46.969> requires<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is the mp3 file format requires that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.510 
is the mp3 file format requires that
animation<00:00:48.930> sequence<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.469> sequences<00:00:50.340> be

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
animation sequence these sequences be

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.650 
animation sequence these sequences be
done<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> order<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.670> creates<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
done in order so that creates a kind of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
done in order so that creates a kind of
a<00:00:54.750> chicken<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.140> egg<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> situation

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
a chicken and egg kind of situation

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
a chicken and egg kind of situation
where<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.180> keyframes<00:00:57.570> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
where you have to have the keyframes in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.819 
where you have to have the keyframes in
the<00:00:57.930> file<00:00:58.170> before<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.090> back<00:01:00.090> later<00:01:00.570> on

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
the file before you can go back later on

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
the file before you can go back later on
with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> problem<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> proper<00:01:03.030> timing

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
model and in this case here just to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
model and in this case here just to
illustrate<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.750> easy<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
illustrate that of how easy that is to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
illustrate that of how easy that is to
achieve<00:01:17.070> I'm<00:01:17.820> simply<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
achieve I'm simply going to use a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
achieve I'm simply going to use a
sequence<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> torso<00:01:20.610> that's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sequence that's for the torso that's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
sequence that's for the torso that's
already<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.869> end<00:01:21.990> III<00:01:22.380> file<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.009> then

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
already in the end III file and then

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
already in the end III file and then
make<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> made<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> quick<00:01:24.479> change<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
make a made a quick change to the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710 
make a made a quick change to the
animation<00:01:26.070> configuration<00:01:26.670> file<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.630> will

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
animation configuration file that will

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
animation configuration file that will
allow<00:01:28.080> us<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> substitute<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.490> rather<00:01:30.150> bad

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
allow us to substitute a rather bad

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.249 
allow us to substitute a rather bad
looking<00:01:30.810> set<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.259> sequences<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.670> more

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
looking set of sequences for a much more

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.969 
looking set of sequences for a much more
appropriate<00:01:35.030> set<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.600> we'll<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.500> jump<00:01:37.829> into

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
appropriate set so we'll just jump into

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
appropriate set so we'll just jump into
the<00:01:38.130> game<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> we'll<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.060> from<00:01:39.090> our<00:01:39.390> idle

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the game here and we'll go from our idle

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.719 
the game here and we'll go from our idle
status<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.170> which<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> already<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.009> the

status here which you already see is the
ever<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.570> popular<00:01:42.750> holding<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.619> weapon<00:01:44.100> too

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
ever so popular holding your weapon too

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
ever so popular holding your weapon too
close<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> chest<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.540> change<00:01:45.810> but

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
close to the chest which will change but

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.670 
close to the chest which will change but
it<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.159> move<00:01:47.700> into<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.450> entity<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:49.590> the

it will move into the entity into the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
it will move into the entity into the
running<00:01:49.860> sequence<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
running sequence you can see now that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.770 
running sequence you can see now that
the<00:01:51.720> old<00:01:51.990> Tom<00:01:52.200> Harris<00:01:52.590> has<00:01:53.119> has<00:01:54.119> adopted<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the old Tom Harris has has adopted a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
the old Tom Harris has has adopted a
much<00:01:54.990> more<00:01:55.259> aggressive<00:01:55.409> stance<00:01:56.100> also<00:01:56.610> note

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
much more aggressive stance also note

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.350 
much more aggressive stance also note
that<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:58.259> bending<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:58.979> effect<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.610> just

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that the bending over effect is just

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
that the bending over effect is just
because<00:02:00.780> i'm<00:02:01.079> using<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.680> third-person

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
because i'm using a third-person

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.130 
because i'm using a third-person
perspective<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.180> control<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> character

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
perspective to control the character

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.789 
perspective to control the character
from<00:02:04.439> from<00:02:05.280> us<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.090> weird<00:02:07.020> angle<00:02:07.350> so

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
from from us from a weird angle so

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.469 
from from us from a weird angle so
there's<00:02:08.580> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.819> some<00:02:09.000> points<00:02:09.390> where

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
there's going to be some points where

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.550 
there's going to be some points where
the<00:02:09.660> character<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the character is actually going to be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.080 
the character is actually going to be
bending<00:02:10.950> over<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.430> bit<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:11.790> than<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
bending over a little bit more than it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.350 
bending over a little bit more than it
should

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
should

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.750 
should
d<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.810> we<00:02:12.960> see<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> first<00:02:14.460> person

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
d but if we see but in the first person

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.710 
d but if we see but in the first person
perspective<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.830> third<00:02:17.040> person<00:02:17.400> view

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.580 
perspective and the third person view
old<00:02:18.720> Tom<00:02:18.990> will<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.320> running<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.290> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
old Tom will be running like this so a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.100 
old Tom will be running like this so a
lot<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.610> lot<00:02:23.880> more<00:02:24.090> aggressive<00:02:24.750> by<00:02:24.930> just

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
lot more a lot more aggressive by just

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.080 
lot more a lot more aggressive by just
just<00:02:25.320> making<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> couple<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.160> simple<00:02:26.640> changes

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
just making a couple of simple changes

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.660 
just making a couple of simple changes
nothing<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.290> too<00:02:28.350> excited<00:02:28.650> about<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.310> you

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
nothing to get too excited about and you

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.730 
nothing to get too excited about and you
can<00:02:29.790> see<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> backwards<00:02:30.740> running

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
can see if in the backwards running

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.930 
can see if in the backwards running
backwards<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.670> bit<00:02:32.760> more

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
backwards is a little bit more

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.120 
backwards is a little bit more
aggressive<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.480> as<00:02:33.630> well<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.080> little<00:02:34.830> bit<00:02:35.010> more

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
aggressive to as well a little bit more

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.190 
aggressive to as well a little bit more
fitting<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> character<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.510> we're<00:02:36.990> going

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
fitting of the character if we're going

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.630 
fitting of the character if we're going
to<00:02:37.260> move<00:02:37.680> side<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.010> side<00:02:40.040> probably<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> lot<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to move side to side probably a lot you

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
to move side to side probably a lot you
know<00:02:41.700> we're<00:02:42.540> blending<00:02:42.750> from<00:02:43.230> from<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:44.040> stance

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
know we're blending from from one stance

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.030 
know we're blending from from one stance
and<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> other<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.410> lot<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.650> stuff<00:02:46.709> is

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and to the other a lot of this stuff is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920 
and to the other a lot of this stuff is
going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.490> tweaked<00:02:47.760> out<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.420> timed<00:02:48.750> in

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
going to be tweaked out and timed in

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.449 
going to be tweaked out and timed in
properly<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.650> looks<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.980> little<00:02:50.130> bit<00:02:50.310> more

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
properly so it looks a little bit more

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.590 
properly so it looks a little bit more
natural<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.150> moves<00:02:51.360> through<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
natural as it moves through the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.070 
natural as it moves through the
sequences<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.820> fire<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> weapon<00:02:54.480> you

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
sequences and if we fire the weapon you

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.380 
sequences and if we fire the weapon you
can<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.070> it's<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.790> same<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.330> of

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
can see that it's it's the same kind of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.720 
can see that it's it's the same kind of
firing<00:02:57.630> set<00:02:58.140> up<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.350> cheer<00:02:58.560> used<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.220> 4.1

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
firing set up to cheer used to and 4.1

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.970 
firing set up to cheer used to and 4.1
there's<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.360> too<00:03:00.570> much<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> difference<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
there's not too much of a difference and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.479 
there's not too much of a difference and
the<00:03:02.430> only<00:03:02.550> thing<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:04.530> going

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the only thing that's really it's going

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.390 
the only thing that's really it's going
to<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> benefit<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.900> by<00:03:07.560> changing

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
to be a benefit really is by changing

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.479 
to be a benefit really is by changing
the<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.810> key<00:03:09.989> posture<00:03:10.500> poses<00:03:10.890> depending<00:03:11.370> on

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the the key posture poses depending on

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.310 
the the key posture poses depending on
the<00:03:11.550> type<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> action<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.959> characters

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
the type of action that the characters

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.640 
the type of action that the characters
is<00:03:13.680> presently<00:03:14.550> involved<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.410> idle

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
is presently involved with so the idle

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.289 
is presently involved with so the idle
stats<00:03:16.890> here<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.670> changing<00:03:17.880> to

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
stats here is going to be changing to

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.750 
stats here is going to be changing to
something<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:18.989> bit<00:03:19.260> more

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
something that's a little bit more

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.479 
something that's a little bit more

weapons out barrel pointing forward but

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.039 
weapons out barrel pointing forward but

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
will flow a little bit more naturally

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.430 
will flow a little bit more naturally

of<00:03:55.580> medicating<00:03:56.580> each<00:03:56.700> other<00:03:56.940> then<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.720> know

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
of medicating each other then you know

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.660 
of medicating each other then you know
it's<00:03:58.380> time<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:58.920> jump<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.459> there

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
it's time they just jump in there

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.100 
it's time they just jump in there
because<00:03:59.910> they<00:04:00.120> got<00:04:00.269> switched<00:04:00.540> back<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.810> their

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
because they got switched back to their

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.370 
because they got switched back to their
weapons<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:02.070> have<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.459> advantage<00:04:03.380> at

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
weapons and you have the advantage at

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.270 
weapons and you have the advantage at
that<00:04:04.500> point<00:04:05.150> free<00:04:06.150> as<00:04:06.510> say<00:04:07.500> for<00:04:07.680> example<00:04:07.739> the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
that point free as say for example the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.170 
that point free as say for example the
reload<00:04:08.850> cycle<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:10.370> character<00:04:11.370> model<00:04:11.700> this

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
reload cycle of the character model this

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.300 
reload cycle of the character model this
is<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> good<00:04:12.600> indication<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.530> player<00:04:14.070> mod

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
is a good indication that the player mod

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.810 
is a good indication that the player mod
the<00:04:14.579> player<00:04:14.760> has<00:04:14.940> run<00:04:15.150> out<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.590> venom<00:04:16.590> and

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
the player has run out of venom and

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.659 
the player has run out of venom and
ammunition<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:19.019> have<00:04:19.320> about<00:04:19.709> my<00:04:20.430> don't

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
ammunition and you have about my don't

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.000 
ammunition and you have about my don't
know<00:04:20.849> maybe<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.840> couple<00:04:22.380> hundredths<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.890> a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
know maybe a couple hundredths of a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.879 
know maybe a couple hundredths of a
second<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.430> get<00:04:23.580> in

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
second to get in

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.059 
second to get in
to<00:04:24.129> get<00:04:24.280> your<00:04:24.430> advantage<00:04:24.909> in<00:04:25.120> your<00:04:25.270> kicks<00:04:25.479> into

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
to get your advantage in your kicks into

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.890 
to get your advantage in your kicks into
also<00:04:27.069> to<00:04:27.129> kind<00:04:27.909> of<00:04:28.030> illustrate<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.599> point<00:04:28.840> of

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
also to kind of illustrate the point of

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.140 
also to kind of illustrate the point of
how<00:04:29.050> things<00:04:29.349> can<00:04:29.560> change<00:04:29.620> let's<00:04:30.490> flip<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
how things can change let's flip the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.230 
how things can change let's flip the
model<00:04:31.270> around<00:04:31.659> here<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.939> take<00:04:33.939> a<00:04:33.969> different

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
model around here and take a different

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.839 
model around here and take a different
perspective<00:04:35.020> view<00:04:35.409> of<00:04:35.469> the<00:04:35.650> model<00:04:35.979> now<00:04:36.610> we<00:04:36.729> can

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
perspective view of the model now we can

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.909 
perspective view of the model now we can
see<00:04:36.999> from<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.479> hear<00:04:38.460> how<00:04:39.460> different<00:04:40.150> a

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
see from this and hear how different a

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.019 
see from this and hear how different a
perspective<00:04:41.919> of<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.099> player<00:04:42.460> model<00:04:42.819> can<00:04:42.999> be

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 
perspective of the player model can be

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.230 
perspective of the player model can be
from<00:04:43.300> one<00:04:43.479> side<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.439> the<00:04:44.650> other<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:45.639> we're<00:04:46.150> not

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
from one side to the other so we're not

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.459 
from one side to the other so we're not
just<00:04:46.300> looking<00:04:46.659> at<00:04:47.159> how<00:04:48.159> a<00:04:49.060> player<00:04:49.900> model<00:04:50.319> looks

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.469 
just looking at how a player model looks

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.779 
just looking at how a player model looks
in<00:04:50.710> in<00:04:51.550> as<00:04:52.090> part<00:04:52.569> of<00:04:52.599> a<00:04:52.689> point<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:53.020> view<00:04:53.289> but<00:04:54.249> as

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
in in as part of a point of view but as

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.469 
in in as part of a point of view but as
well<00:04:55.240> as<00:04:55.389> how<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.719> player<00:04:56.340> model<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.580> situated

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
well as how the player model is situated

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.540 
well as how the player model is situated
in<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:59.110> three-dimensional<00:04:59.409> environment<00:04:59.800> so

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
in a three-dimensional environment so

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.429 
in a three-dimensional environment so
this<00:05:00.669> looks<00:05:00.819> a<00:05:01.060> definitely<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.139> lot<00:05:02.379> more

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:02.439 
this looks a definitely a lot more

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.399 
this looks a definitely a lot more
aggressive<00:05:03.159> from<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.550> on<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.779> right<00:05:05.139> side<00:05:05.289> of

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
aggressive from the on the right side of

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.540 
aggressive from the on the right side of
the<00:05:05.439> player<00:05:05.650> model<00:05:05.949> than<00:05:06.069> it<00:05:06.189> does<00:05:06.310> on<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
the player model than it does on the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.999 
the player model than it does on the
left<00:05:06.729> side<00:05:06.909> and<00:05:07.569> you<00:05:07.810> can<00:05:07.900> see<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.229> for<00:05:08.949> sure

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
left side and you can see that for sure

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.179 
left side and you can see that for sure
in<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.669> firing<00:05:10.060> sequences<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.990> as<00:05:11.439> well<00:05:11.650> and

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 
in the firing sequences to as well and

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:14.850 
in the firing sequences to as well and
if<00:05:12.639> we<00:05:12.759> do<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.120> reload<00:05:13.419> cycle<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.560> can<00:05:14.710> see

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
if we do the reload cycle you can see

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.309 
if we do the reload cycle you can see
that<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.219> reload<00:05:15.610> cycle<00:05:16.050> seems<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:17.199> be<00:05:17.289> a

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
that the reload cycle seems to be a

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.839 
that the reload cycle seems to be a
little<00:05:17.439> bit<00:05:17.620> more<00:05:17.740> appropriate<00:05:18.279> on<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.610> side

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
little bit more appropriate on this side

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.110 
little bit more appropriate on this side
here<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.389> it<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.110> on<00:05:20.379> the<00:05:20.469> left<00:05:20.620> side<00:05:20.909> now<00:05:21.909> by

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
have to work in sequential order based

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.070 
have to work in sequential order based
on<00:05:37.839> on<00:05:38.189> on<00:05:39.189> what<00:05:39.699> is<00:05:39.849> occurring<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.659> the<00:05:40.870> game

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
on on on what is occurring in the game

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.139 
on on on what is occurring in the game
in<00:05:41.289> real<00:05:41.439> time<00:05:41.710> so<00:05:41.979> as<00:05:42.399> you<00:05:42.490> can<00:05:42.580> see<00:05:42.819> we<00:05:43.120> are

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.920 
secondary weapons are adjusted to this
cut<00:05:55.479> it<00:05:55.839> to<00:05:56.050> this<00:05:56.199> to<00:05:56.649> these<00:05:57.629> contact<00:05:58.629> points

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
cut it to this to these contact points

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.249 
cut it to this to these contact points
so<00:05:59.919> it's<00:06:00.819> obvious<00:06:01.300> that<00:06:01.330> based<00:06:01.990> on<00:06:02.110> their

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
so it's obvious that based on their

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.139 
so it's obvious that based on their
testing<00:06:02.620> we<00:06:02.710> could<00:06:02.860> not<00:06:02.979> adjust<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.399> p90<00:06:03.939> so

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
testing we could not adjust a p90 so

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:06.629 
testing we could not adjust a p90 so
based<00:06:04.509> on<00:06:04.659> the<00:06:04.779> p90<00:06:05.259> alone<00:06:05.529> we<00:06:05.800> have<00:06:05.949> that<00:06:06.099> had

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
based on the p90 alone we have that had

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.029 
based on the p90 alone we have that had
to<00:06:06.789> add<00:06:06.939> an<00:06:07.089> entirely<00:06:07.449> new<00:06:07.719> sequence<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:09.009> the

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
to add an entirely new sequence to the

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.149 
to add an entirely new sequence to the
to<00:06:09.849> do<00:06:10.000> to<00:06:10.449> the<00:06:10.569> order<00:06:10.870> that<00:06:11.319> will<00:06:11.500> allow<00:06:11.800> for

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
to do to the order that will allow for

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.070 
to do to the order that will allow for
the<00:06:12.250> proper<00:06:12.610> contact<00:06:12.969> points<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.389> p90<00:06:13.899> and

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
the proper contact points of the p90 and

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.899 
the proper contact points of the p90 and
you<00:06:15.039> can<00:06:15.159> see<00:06:15.310> that<00:06:16.710> largely<00:06:17.710> exaggerated<00:06:18.669> in

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
you can see that largely exaggerated in

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.899 
you can see that largely exaggerated in
the<00:06:18.939> firing<00:06:19.629> sequence<00:06:23.009> it<00:06:24.009> looks<00:06:24.279> really<00:06:24.729> good

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
the firing sequence it looks really good

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.029 
the firing sequence it looks really good
except<00:06:25.300> for<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.509> fact<00:06:25.689> that<00:06:25.899> you<00:06:26.770> know<00:06:26.860> we

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
except for the fact that you know we

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.709 
except for the fact that you know we
want<00:06:27.189> to<00:06:27.399> keep<00:06:27.639> this<00:06:27.759> weapon<00:06:28.120> up<00:06:28.240> close<00:06:28.270> and

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
want to keep this weapon up close and

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.899 
want to keep this weapon up close and
tight<00:06:28.899> into<00:06:29.229> the<00:06:29.349> body<00:06:29.529> based<00:06:30.339> on<00:06:30.490> its<00:06:30.669> frame

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
tight into the body based on its frame

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.810 
tight into the body based on its frame
and<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:32.050> contact<00:06:32.469> points<00:06:32.800> for<00:06:32.949> the<00:06:33.069> left<00:06:33.580> hand

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
and the contact points for the left hand

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.470 
and the contact points for the left hand
are<00:06:33.970> way<00:06:34.390> out<00:06:34.690> of<00:06:34.720> whack<00:06:34.960> based<00:06:35.950> on<00:06:36.480> having

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
are way out of whack based on having

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.750 
are way out of whack based on having
access<00:06:38.020> only<00:06:38.230> to<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.860> sequences<00:06:39.490> that<00:06:39.520> are

access only to the sequences that are

weapons<00:06:42.250> let's<00:06:42.700> take<00:06:42.850> a<00:06:42.970> look<00:06:43.120> at<00:06:43.150> that<00:06:43.330> from

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
weapons let's take a look at that from

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.870 
weapons let's take a look at that from
the<00:06:44.230> other<00:06:44.350> side<00:06:44.560> again<00:06:44.860> and<00:06:45.130> to<00:06:45.460> kind<00:06:45.850> of

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
the other side again and to kind of

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.490 
the other side again and to kind of
illustrate<00:06:46.030> how<00:06:46.510> things<00:06:46.750> can<00:06:46.930> change<00:06:46.990> once

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
illustrate how things can change once

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.500 
illustrate how things can change once
you<00:06:47.620> change<00:06:47.770> your<00:06:48.250> important<00:06:48.790> of<00:06:48.910> viewer

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
you change your important of viewer

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.780 
you change your important of viewer
perspective<00:06:50.140> doesn't<00:06:50.710> look<00:06:50.950> to<00:06:51.100> it<00:06:51.280> as

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
perspective doesn't look to it as

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.600 
perspective doesn't look to it as
doesn't<00:06:52.660> look<00:06:52.750> as<00:06:52.900> bad<00:06:52.930> even<00:06:53.680> though<00:06:53.800> the<00:06:54.400> tan

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
doesn't look as bad even though the tan

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.040 
doesn't look as bad even though the tan
is<00:06:54.790> placed<00:06:55.030> on<00:06:55.150> the<00:06:55.300> muzzle<00:06:55.630> and<00:06:55.660> we<00:06:55.840> had<00:06:55.960> the

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
is placed on the muzzle and we had the

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.400 
is placed on the muzzle and we had the
same<00:06:56.200> problem<00:06:57.420> the<00:06:58.420> reload<00:06:58.750> cycle<00:07:01.080> once<00:07:02.080> again

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
same problem the reload cycle once again

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.200 
same problem the reload cycle once again
from<00:07:02.980> a<00:07:03.040> point<00:07:03.220> of<00:07:03.340> view<00:07:03.400> looks<00:07:03.790> a<00:07:03.910> lot<00:07:04.030> better

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
from a point of view looks a lot better

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.730 
from a point of view looks a lot better
from<00:07:04.660> the<00:07:04.810> right<00:07:04.990> side<00:07:05.170> than<00:07:05.380> it<00:07:05.470> does<00:07:05.650> from

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
from the right side than it does from

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.490 
from the right side than it does from
the<00:07:05.860> left<00:07:06.100> and<00:07:06.750> even<00:07:07.750> even<00:07:08.380> the

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
the left and even even the

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.790 
the left and even even the
aggressiveness<00:07:09.370> of<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.610> player<00:07:09.970> model

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
aggressiveness of the player model

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.740 
aggressiveness of the player model
running<00:07:11.800> an<00:07:11.890> attacking<00:07:12.360> looks<00:07:13.360> much<00:07:13.570> better

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
running an attacking looks much better

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.510 
running an attacking looks much better
so<00:07:16.750> these<00:07:16.960> are<00:07:17.170> the<00:07:17.200> small<00:07:18.070> little<00:07:18.220> brush

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
so these are the small little brush

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.250 
so these are the small little brush
strokes<00:07:18.820> that<00:07:18.940> still<00:07:19.240> need<00:07:19.390> to<00:07:19.420> be<00:07:19.540> added<00:07:19.960> and

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.260 
strokes that still need to be added and

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.920 
strokes that still need to be added and
once<00:07:21.010> the<00:07:21.250> once<00:07:21.640> the<00:07:21.700> flare<00:07:21.880> balls<00:07:22.090> goes<00:07:22.600> in
