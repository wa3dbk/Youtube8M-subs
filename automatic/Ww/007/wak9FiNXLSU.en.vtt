00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 very we leave you in minecraft 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.700
 1.72 and let's see a more curious way 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.440
 more than anything the truth is that you already know 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.549
 that there are seasons in which they leave 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.849
 many taxis taxis and others in which it 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.849
 more curious 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.869
 the truth is that he is curious but 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 it's still in beta and you notice it because 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.090
 many times believe it is meaningless but 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 well the practical question because if 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.280
 we have this here that is like 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.110
 fragment of cloud or something like that is done 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.480
 with a diamond a slim ball an under 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.460
 pearl and a bucket of water and with this 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.420
 we can do this that is the tool 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.550
 for cloud pets or something like that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.050
 does with two iron 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 or if with four iron that of certain 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
 on each side the fragment east of cloud and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 a stick I do not know why here leaves 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.350
 another color but it 's a normal stick yes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 done changes the color of the stick does not exist 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 because that has to be a flaw or something 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.619
 but the colors of the clubs change 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.790
 finally the question is that with this 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.790
 we can invoke 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 the cloud 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.330
 right click and we can is put a 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 cloud mascot or something like that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.250
 that this bug here 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.480
 that is very cute but the truth is that it is 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.760
 a little weird because it does not follow you or anything 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.070
 neither is yours is rather like more 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.960
 that a pet I would call a 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.320
 combat tool more than the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.680
 what 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 is that the sound of 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 experience when I'm near the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.100
 question is that we make them 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.900
 and stick with any bug that has 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.430
 close by that I think more than a 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.280
 pet since it does not follow you because if 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 happens it is simply more a tool 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.990
 combat 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.560
 I do not know why now he's hitting us 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.720
 times 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.340
 It seems that he does not want to hit him sometimes 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.799
 a little weird 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 let's go maximum because now I'm in 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.280
 creative but in underlining you can also 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.289
 get all you want in passes that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.050
 says the author that if you take out many of 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.110
 blows thanks to call me home or for the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.150
 sports talking to more needs is 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.640
 there you need a companion then a 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.950
 hello hello how will you throw yourself for the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.290
 train but what I say is that it seems 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.400
 more a combat tool than a 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.400
 pet as such 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.950
 you need company 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:43.870
 little clouds that is called cloud or cloud cloud 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.420
 I suppose I suppose that from the aspect that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.799
 he has put the skin I do not know but as 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.329
 I say is a bowl that is in beta then 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.310
 they still have to improve enough 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.510
 another thing is that if we kill them they give us 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.810
 spending tears 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.579
 they give us the souls of these gas 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.189
 and on top how can we kill all the 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.870
 Sometimes we want the files of 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.370
 these infinite transformations before 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.019
 they kill a few and I was wanted 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.019
 the tears 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.150
 irma grace the game is a bit weird to 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.040
 see now if it accumulates if you have 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.500
 accumulated before not before 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.110
 picked up and did not know here on 2 and when going to 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 make it happen more fun or but 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 good as you see a mod covered seven more 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.860
 that last that nothing 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.890
 and also what's interesting and what's 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.890
 we are if there were here 2 to 0 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.490
 we can continue to remove all that 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.680
 we want if it is not spent but good as 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.390
 you see a rather curious way that as 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 I say it is more a tool of combat and 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.060
 another thing more than this is that this leaves 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.010
 of pet has little because it happens 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.140
 kind but good the truth that is 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.730
 quite cover or 7 as I say but good 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.580
 you have choose the description as I say it is 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.850
 for the 1.7 point 2 it is installed with force 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.850
 etc 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.080
 bye
