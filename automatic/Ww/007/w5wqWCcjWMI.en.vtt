00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.660
 teachers are run over and 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.110
 keyboards and troubled retruco sides 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.130
 people sometimes have to last parents 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.400
 from the enemy of insolence and evil 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.910
 absolutely out of the ordinary education is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.029
 is the public dimension of a teacher and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.760
 the conciliation proceedings and the book 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.390
 say that for much less anyone 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.059
 we in our various jobs would already have 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.110
 put your arms down and you've given up 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.760
 I do not think people are 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.220
 motivated 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.739
 indeed I must say that today it was concluded 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.350
 that ex how is it that they 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.049
 they did not get angry anymore but they have 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.580
 with mere blood can not make some 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.920
 figures as we have already seen 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.799
 manifestations because the teacher is 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.100
 always an example and can not have some 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:02.510
 observations as we have seen now is me 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.489
 I still think that in one state 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.549
 friend of justice 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.159
 we have to believe I realize that no 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.829
 there is a state based on justice that 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.049
 I wanted this important thing 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.609
 val as an emphatic way but I believe 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.340
 fully into this, right? 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.219
 on the day the risks of childhood and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.829
 the first courses I'm winning 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.899
 However as the judge we are close 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.810
 They reached state justice in relation to 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.820
 people because the way we say 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.399
 Thank clearer and we can form 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.729
 require the performance they understand 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.310
 but in fact very careful time 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.950
 childhood the first cycle teacher 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.859
 are so indispensable are so precious 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.560
 are so delicate in the growth of 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.590
 our children if they are not treated with 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.630
 respect but with funds part with 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.539
 gratitude they deserve 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.380
 obviously that they can walk should 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.509
 january 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.539
 I think we have more than 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.689
 because although they are disconnected from 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.549
 once in a while they are there every day 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.549
 our children have 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.980
 knowledge 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.440
 this is something that takes're nobility 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.860
 disregarding teachers should be 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.860
 crime
