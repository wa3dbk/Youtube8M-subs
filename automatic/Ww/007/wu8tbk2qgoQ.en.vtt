power through some series because I've

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.149

my video

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.030 
my video
on<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:02.910> it's<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> hand<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.080> decided<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
on that it's out of hand so I decided to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
on that it's out of hand so I decided to
pick<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.760> varsity's<00:02:06.120> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> could<00:02:06.570> finish<00:02:06.720> this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
pick up varsity's so I could finish this

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.780 
pick up varsity's so I could finish this
and<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.410> series<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> kind<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.340> different

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
and this series is kind of a different

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.760 
and this series is kind of a different
take<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> Persephone<00:02:09.960> myth<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.619> main

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
take on the Persephone myth the main

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
character Kate she undergoes the goddess

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720 
character Kate she undergoes the goddess
test<00:02:13.320> which<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.740> pretty<00:02:13.950> much<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> series<00:02:14.580> of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
test which is pretty much a series of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.720 
test which is pretty much a series of
tests<00:02:15.450> if<00:02:16.140> she<00:02:16.320> succeeds<00:02:16.890> she<00:02:17.220> becomes<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
tests if she succeeds she becomes the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
tests if she succeeds she becomes the
goddess<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> underworld<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.260> did

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
goddess of the underworld and I did

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.900 
goddess of the underworld and I did
really<00:02:19.590> enjoy<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.010> first<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.580> second

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
really enjoy the first one the second

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.760 
really enjoy the first one the second
one<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.330> did<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> few<00:02:22.080> more<00:02:22.200> problems<00:02:22.560> with

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
one I did have a few more problems with

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.590 
one I did have a few more problems with
so<00:02:23.010> I'm<00:02:23.370> intrigued<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.910> see<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.300> end<00:02:24.480> up

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
so I'm intrigued to see what I end up

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.220 
so I'm intrigued to see what I end up
thinking<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.100> concluding<00:02:26.850> story<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.990> also

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
thinking of the concluding story I also

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.560 
thinking of the concluding story I also
have<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.950> Isle<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.310> blood<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.240> final

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
have the Isle of blood and the final

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.270 
have the Isle of blood and the final
descent<00:02:30.840> by<00:02:31.050> Rick<00:02:31.290> Yancey<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> last<00:02:32.070> two

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
descent by Rick Yancey the last two

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.550 
descent by Rick Yancey the last two
books<00:02:32.460> from<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.180> monstrum<00:02:33.600> ologist<00:02:34.020> series

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
books from the monstrum ologist series

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.950 
books from the monstrum ologist series
now<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> haven't<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.400> started<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
now I haven't actually started the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.330 
now I haven't actually started the
series<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.530> don't<00:02:37.740> really<00:02:37.860> know<00:02:38.010> too<00:02:38.070> much

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
series I don't really know too much

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.390 
series I don't really know too much
about<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.910> series<00:02:39.270> but<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.690> kind<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.080> about

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
about the series but it's kind of about

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.820 
about the series but it's kind of about
monstrum<00:02:41.400> ology<00:02:41.700> which<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.360> study<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
monstrum ology which is the study of

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.900 
monstrum ology which is the study of
monsters<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.100> think<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> main<00:02:44.459> character

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
monsters and I think the main character

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.140 
monsters and I think the main character
is<00:02:45.090> an<00:02:45.180> apprentice<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> doctor<00:02:46.290> who<00:02:46.500> is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
is an apprentice for a doctor who is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.340 
is an apprentice for a doctor who is
studying<00:02:48.150> monsters<00:02:48.570> or<00:02:48.780> something<00:02:49.050> like<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
studying monsters or something like that

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.050 
studying monsters or something like that
so<00:02:49.620> I'm<00:02:50.040> not<00:02:50.220> entirely<00:02:50.490> sure<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:50.970> about

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
so I'm not entirely sure what it's about

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.730 
so I'm not entirely sure what it's about
but<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.450> sounds<00:02:51.780> pretty<00:02:51.959> cool<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.500> think

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
but it sounds pretty cool and I think

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.500 
but it sounds pretty cool and I think
this<00:02:52.860> might<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> good<00:02:53.580> series<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.209> pick<00:02:54.390> up

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
this might be a good series to pick up

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.080 
this might be a good series to pick up
around<00:02:54.930> Halloween<00:02:55.620> time<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.130> possibly<00:02:56.280> since

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
around Halloween time and possibly since

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210 
around Halloween time and possibly since
I<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.660> entire<00:02:57.930> series<00:02:58.320> now<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.740> could

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
I have the entire series now I could

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.000 
I have the entire series now I could
just<00:02:59.250> marathon<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.630> whole<00:03:00.840> lot<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.320> also<00:03:01.620> have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
just marathon the whole lot I also have

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.390 
just marathon the whole lot I also have
the<00:03:02.580> entire<00:03:02.910> Death<00:03:03.450> Note<00:03:03.480> manga<00:03:04.440> series<00:03:04.980> but

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the entire Death Note manga series but

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.310 
the entire Death Note manga series but
two<00:03:05.550> goomy<00:03:05.850> over<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> complete

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
two goomy over now this is the complete

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.550 
two goomy over now this is the complete
black<00:03:07.950> edition<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.940> each<00:03:09.180> book<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:10.110> bind<00:03:10.410> up

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
black edition so each book is a bind up

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.509 
black edition so each book is a bind up
of<00:03:10.709> two<00:03:10.950> volumes

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
of two volumes
