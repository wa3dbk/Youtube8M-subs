talk to you today about the importance

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.329 
talk to you today about the importance
of<00:00:34.129> design<00:00:34.989> look<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.260> don't<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.739> first<00:00:36.980> seasons

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
of design look I don't the first seasons

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.000 
of design look I don't the first seasons
like<00:00:37.519> it's<00:00:38.059> intense<00:00:38.589> everyone<00:00:39.589> wants<00:00:39.890> more

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
like it's intense everyone wants more

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.939 
like it's intense everyone wants more
time<00:00:40.280> right<00:00:40.670> well<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:42.170> don't<00:00:42.290> get<00:00:42.470> more<00:00:42.680> time

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
time right well you don't get more time

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.360 
time right well you don't get more time
no<00:00:43.610> no<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.479> don't<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.260> through<00:00:45.500> design<00:00:45.890> you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
no no you don't but through design you

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.130 
no no you don't but through design you
can<00:00:46.550> make<00:00:46.729> better<00:00:47.000> use<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.570> time<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.899> you

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
can make better use of the time that you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.680 
can make better use of the time that you
have<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.860> be<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:49.309> efficient<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.030> get<00:00:50.510> more

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
have to be more efficient and get more

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.810 
have to be more efficient and get more
done<00:00:50.929> now<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.739> know<00:00:51.920> it's<00:00:52.160> tempting<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.640> just

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
done now I know it's tempting to just

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.430 
done now I know it's tempting to just
grab<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> piece<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.570> aluminum<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.260> start

grab a piece of aluminum and start
building<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.829> first<00:00:55.010> thing<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.370> pops<00:00:55.609> in

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
building the first thing that pops in

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.079

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
your head I know I have but this really

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.479 
your head I know I have but this really
only<00:00:59.600> works<00:00:59.870> for<00:01:00.079> very<00:01:00.469> simple<00:01:00.920> challenges

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
only works for very simple challenges

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.479 
only works for very simple challenges
and<00:01:01.699> as<00:01:02.149> we<00:01:02.300> all<00:01:02.420> know<00:01:02.629> first<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.710> anything<00:01:04.250> but

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
and as we all know first is anything but

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.020 
and as we all know first is anything but

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
thinking the design process is your

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.880 
thinking the design process is your
roadmap<00:01:16.850> through<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:17.479> minefield<00:01:17.890> seeing

roadmap through this minefield seeing

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.380 
roadmap through this minefield seeing
that<00:01:19.100> journey<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:19.670> understanding<00:01:20.270> the

that journey and understanding the

that journey and understanding the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
process of design is what this video is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.600 
process of design is what this video is
all<00:01:22.790> about<00:01:23.530> now<00:01:24.530> you're<00:01:24.740> saying<00:01:25.009> I<00:01:25.369> already

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
all about now you're saying I already

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.280 
all about now you're saying I already
know<00:01:25.909> all<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.210> grant<00:01:26.600> what's<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
know all this grant what's the

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.139 
know all this grant what's the
difference<00:01:27.740> well<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.640> difference<00:01:28.670> I'm

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
difference well the difference I'm

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.819 
difference well the difference I'm
suggesting<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.049> pay<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.290> little<00:01:30.560> more

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
suggesting is that you pay a little more

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.889 
suggesting is that you pay a little more
attention<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.549> very<00:01:31.759> early<00:01:32.299> stages<00:01:32.600> of

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
attention to the very early stages of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.170 
attention to the very early stages of
your<00:01:33.020> design<00:01:33.320> process<00:01:33.909> now<00:01:34.909> you're<00:01:35.060> probably

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
your design process now you're probably

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.620 
your design process now you're probably
thinking<00:01:35.360> whoa<00:01:35.719> whoa<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.950> do<00:01:37.159> design<00:01:37.640> we<00:01:38.360> draw

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
thinking whoa whoa we do design we draw

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.910 
thinking whoa whoa we do design we draw
it<00:01:38.719> on<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.840> piece<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.140> paper<00:01:39.439> or<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:39.799> a

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
it on a piece of paper or on a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.370 
it on a piece of paper or on a
whiteboard<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.640> then<00:01:40.729> we<00:01:40.909> build<00:01:41.149> it<00:01:41.380> well

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
whiteboard and then we build it well

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.560 
whiteboard and then we build it well
before<00:01:42.649> charging<00:01:43.340> forward<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.820> making<00:01:44.060> parts

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
before charging forward to making parts

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.899 
before charging forward to making parts
just<00:01:45.170> take<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> little<00:01:45.710> time<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.369> make<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.549> study

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
just take a little time to make a study

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.149 
just take a little time to make a study
model<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.899> can<00:01:48.079> be<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.409> computer<00:01:48.829> using

doesn't matter what you use as long as
it<00:01:56.689> helps<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.049> work<00:01:57.320> out<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.710> problems

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
it helps you work out the problems

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.990 
it helps you work out the problems
because<00:01:59.270> let's<00:01:59.869> face<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.159> making<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.250> part<00:02:01.520> over

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
and over and over again is not only

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.370 
and over and over again is not only
frustrating<00:02:04.850> but<00:02:05.299> also<00:02:05.479> very<00:02:05.899> time-consuming
