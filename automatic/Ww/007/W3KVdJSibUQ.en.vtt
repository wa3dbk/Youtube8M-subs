00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 we must move to another 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.430
 the level is sold that is what 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.930
 asking for a brand is there a product somewhere 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.730
 there is exactly our trading 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 google drive representatives 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.280
 represented by someone and bazarbayeva engaged 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 by the fact that it works with 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.970
 such partners that is looking for her 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.600
 works to conclude such 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.299
 we already have contracts 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.720
 many different plans for this you are already such 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.340
 the first incarnation of what is in March 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.830
 last year at this exhibition 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.590
 which you are now covering 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.700
 there was this meeting dating 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.500
 and when exactly is a good production 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.789
 no one there is a little bit lacking 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.460
 example name 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.340
 and we can provide it and good 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.320
 sketches from we found a consensus that is we 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.759
 always looking for a partner what is your friend 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.480
 it is interesting to each other for him therefore 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.550
 useful we do not go cut 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.430
 and what we are doing right now and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.140
 there were different collections that is understandable 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.390
 the thing is that if I am so embroidered here 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.160
 dress is certainly not everyday and it is 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.960
 not the mass that is it already 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.630
 almost very difficult to repeat it 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.410
 big quantity and sell by 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.740
 good price 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.080
 Yes, she is on the family that is, I 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.540
 girls can it in the morning she work 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.510
 in the evening somewhere there is enough 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.510
 Itâ€™s not exactly that for the price 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.610
 and the price-quality it matched 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 it is very difficult to find such inside the country 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.140
 producing nobody first of that level 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 the quality we need to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.090
 understand working on the same wavelength 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.370
 I have great requests so sometimes 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.260
 Sometimes it is difficult for me out there like 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.450
 many people understand because i'm sort of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.000
 running somewhere ahead see something far 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.150
 not always deciphering but in fact 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.819
 as a result, it turns out what you need 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.980
 but forever the fast way honestly therefore 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.690
 it was exactly such a case 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.430
 if we would have production 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.650
 workshops that would go on contracts here 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.709
 such a plan took painful designers 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.989
 would say i want to work with you yes i 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.720
 I want to secure a sales volume for 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.660
 account of you why not we can too for me 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.000
 even turn we always sing 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.940
 and we will always find some contract 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.010
 These were different things, but at the same time all 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.379
 could each other without displacing from the market 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.420
 fee is very much in different countries and 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.580
 the head office itself he always keeps in touch 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.920
 with different clients 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.300
 Most of the order of course 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.240
 that sometimes even Moscow 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.360
 sometimes the level of haute couture evening dresses 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.890
 not every star not every 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.530
 man can find himself 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.810
 it is and therefore in appeal to me 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.890
 there is a concept of Georgian fashion Ukrainian 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.680
 designer Russian designers 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.160
 Kazakhstan fashion and at the same time all the same 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.160
 we are all together for all our difference 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.190
 from every country we are the same 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.620
 that is, and Kazakhstani fashion is similar to 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.160
 Kazakhstani Russian and Russian 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.160
 etc 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.930
 exhibition in March it will be our such 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.120
 little anniversary than you fear now 14 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.380
 different from previous ones well firstly 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.110
 headquarters 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.730
 this is more exhibition space this 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.170
 more participants 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.660
 this more brands this 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.430
 more visitors more 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.540
 the number of cases and programs that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.090
 enter this bet 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.210
 as you could already see the exhibition has 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.280
 the three main components the first is this 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.849
 format where participants where we happened 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.620
 increase the second component is 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:17.020
 show some shows and 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.360
 nasty shows we attract more 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.400
 number of designer total 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.529
 until 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.899
 tell you how 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:28.789
 fashion week usually body 34 shows we 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:31.579
 occupy another completely new niche 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.500
 three days we have some 36 watts showing 

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:34.810
 but 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.920
 they are already asking for high fashion prints 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.860
 and my brand brands 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.780
 and indeed the component that we have is 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.090
 business program now is more pain 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.430
 what are the speakers extended geography 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.490
 these applicants are good at quantity 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.470
 books from cases here we go the way 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.650
 sure 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.230
 not only quantity but quality 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.480
 today in the opening of the exhibition 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.890
 performed kuralay nurkadilova which 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.740
 talked about birth 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.170
 parables brand brand which was born in 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.390
 within this exhibition 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:11.930
 this spring she met on 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.540
 exhibition here to participants of the company bsk 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:23.320
 they made a contract for not born himself 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:23.320
 if we have already released clothes 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.610
 both Russia and abroad 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.680
 I can say that interest designers with 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.860
 it grows so it starts because 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.410
 what our designers are ready to contribute in 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.050
 such work is not all having such 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.620
 capacities who are ready for those not 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.660
 opportunities and this alternative is possible 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.000
 say a platform for designers a for 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.520
 brands is already familiar informat and 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.910
 here just the same, and is 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.160
 demand baiir who write 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.400
 collections 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.719
 procurement on stands 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.349
 both style 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:01.349
 ears
