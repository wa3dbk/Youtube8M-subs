reason<00:04:35.890> behind<00:04:36.010> perhaps<00:04:36.640> may<00:04:36.910> be<00:04:36.970> returning

reason behind perhaps may be returning

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.330 
reason behind perhaps may be returning
this<00:04:37.480> is<00:04:37.720> because<00:04:38.080> i<00:04:38.350> love<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.800> color<00:04:39.010> i<00:04:39.130> love

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
this is because i love the color i love

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.730 
this is because i love the color i love
the<00:04:39.430> shape<00:04:39.670> but<00:04:40.360> i<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:40.660> think<00:04:41.020> this<00:04:41.380> looks<00:04:41.590> like

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
the shape but i do think this looks like

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.070 
the shape but i do think this looks like
it<00:04:41.920> could<00:04:41.950> it's<00:04:42.370> meant<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.610> be<00:04:42.670> 170<00:04:43.450> euro<00:04:43.630> like

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
it could it's meant to be 170 euro like

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.430 
it could it's meant to be 170 euro like
i<00:04:44.760> don't<00:04:45.760> i<00:04:46.330> just<00:04:46.450> think<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:46.930> looks<00:04:47.230> like<00:04:47.320> it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
i don't i just think this looks like it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.690 
i don't i just think this looks like it
could<00:04:47.470> be<00:04:47.650> 30<00:04:47.920> i<00:04:47.980> think<00:04:48.280> this<00:04:48.340> looks<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:48.640> a

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
could be 30 i think this looks like a

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.150 
could be 30 i think this looks like a
kobe<00:04:49.000> from<00:04:49.150> Primark<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.960> be<00:04:50.050> honest<00:04:50.290> stats<00:04:51.010> has

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
kobe from Primark to be honest stats has

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.710 
kobe from Primark to be honest stats has
put<00:04:51.280> me<00:04:51.370> off<00:04:51.490> like<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.730> like<00:04:51.910> if<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.240> just<00:04:52.540> don't

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
think it's worth the money and that's

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.130 
think it's worth the money and that's
what<00:04:54.370> I'm<00:04:54.520> kind<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.910> think<00:04:55.120> enough<00:04:55.360> so<00:04:55.600> let<00:04:55.990> me

expensive<00:05:07.720> but<00:05:07.810> that's<00:05:08.050> probably<00:05:08.320> me<00:05:08.500> being

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
expensive but that's probably me being
