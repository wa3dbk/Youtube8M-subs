X&amp;Y wife after with me the wall integral
today<00:00:07.259> were<00:00:07.379> battling<00:00:07.680> Cameron<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:08.429> let's<00:00:08.610> go

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
today were battling Cameron so let's go

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.660 
today were battling Cameron so let's go
bowl<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:10.080> send<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.830> my<00:00:10.860> man<00:00:11.160> Omar<00:00:11.280> first

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
bowl I send out my man Omar first

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.339 
bowl I send out my man Omar first
figured<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.719> know<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> best

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
figured that you know it's the best

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.169 
figured that you know it's the best
against<00:00:13.799> most<00:00:14.070> things<00:00:14.280> he<00:00:14.849> goes<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
against most things he goes for a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.290 
against most things he goes for a
gyarados<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> think<00:00:16.890> he<00:00:17.550> uses<00:00:17.699> intimidate

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
gyarados so I think he uses intimidate

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.730 
gyarados so I think he uses intimidate
which<00:00:18.420> raises<00:00:18.690> my<00:00:18.960> attack<00:00:18.990> which<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> pretty

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
which raises my attack which is pretty

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.769 
which raises my attack which is pretty
damn<00:00:19.980> awesome<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.550> give<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> rockslide

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
damn awesome I give for the rockslide

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.060 
damn awesome I give for the rockslide
which<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.590> super<00:00:22.890> effective

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
which is gonna be super effective

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.970 
which is gonna be super effective
against<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.519> gyarados<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.830> with<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
against this gyarados and with the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
against this gyarados and with the
attack<00:00:26.220> raised<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.699> does<00:00:26.820> pretty<00:00:27.090> decent

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
attack raised it does pretty decent

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.269 
attack raised it does pretty decent
damage<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.900> fair<00:00:28.080> since<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.010> don't<00:00:29.130> get

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
damage to be fair since we don't get

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.130 
damage to be fair since we don't get
stabbed<00:00:29.550> from<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> he<00:00:30.390> gives<00:00:30.599> her<00:00:30.720> dragon

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
stabbed from it he gives her dragon

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.389 
stabbed from it he gives her dragon
dance<00:00:31.349> however<00:00:31.619> which<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.949> gonna<00:00:32.070> raise<00:00:32.219> his

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
dance however which is gonna raise his

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.850 
dance however which is gonna raise his
attack<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.030> Pete's<00:00:33.300> peed<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> its

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
attack and it's Pete's peed and its

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040 
attack and it's Pete's peed and its
speed<00:00:35.190> which<00:00:35.880> then<00:00:36.059> makes<00:00:36.239> him<00:00:36.420> faster<00:00:36.899> than

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
speed which then makes him faster than

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
speed which then makes him faster than
me<00:00:37.140> he<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> waterfall<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.640> obviously

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
me he is for a waterfall and obviously

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
me he is for a waterfall and obviously
the<00:00:39.090> attack<00:00:39.329> Rays<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:39.960> careful<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the attack Rays have to be careful of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.490 
the attack Rays have to be careful of
that<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.920> he<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:41.910> does<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.840> doing

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that and he then does you know I doing

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
that and he then does you know I doing
my<00:00:43.590> damage<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.640> avoids<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.120> second<00:00:45.450> rocks<00:00:45.600> tie

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
my damage he avoids my second rocks tie

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
my damage he avoids my second rocks tie
which<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:46.200> sucks<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> switch<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.550> squad

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
which really sucks so I switch my squad

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.479 
which really sucks so I switch my squad
out<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.980> figuring<00:00:49.980> something<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
out and we go to figuring something of a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.049 
out and we go to figuring something of a
waterfall<00:00:50.789> go<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> toxic<00:00:52.280> who<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.520> resists

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
waterfall go to toxic who then resists

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
waterfall go to toxic who then resists
the<00:00:54.300> waterfall<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.739> pretty<00:00:55.980> well<00:00:56.219> I'm

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the waterfall I think pretty well I'm

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
the waterfall I think pretty well I'm
not<00:00:56.539> quite<00:00:57.539> sure<00:00:57.570> count<00:00:57.899> number<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.350> yeah<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
not quite sure count number but yeah it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.170 
not quite sure count number but yeah it
was<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.370> pretty<00:00:59.520> well<00:00:59.640> since<00:00:59.910> he's<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
was this it pretty well since he's not a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.479 
was this it pretty well since he's not a
defensive<00:01:00.690> Pokemon<00:01:01.129> gyarados<00:01:02.129> fingers<00:01:02.370> for

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
defensive Pokemon gyarados fingers for

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.529 
defensive Pokemon gyarados fingers for
earthquake<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> Kuala

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
earthquake which is going to Kuala

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
earthquake which is going to Kuala
damage<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.320> especially<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.799> attack

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
damage actually especially the attack

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
damage actually especially the attack
raise<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:06.000> takes<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.200> TRO<00:01:07.380> gold

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
raise and actually takes out my TRO gold

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.010 
raise and actually takes out my TRO gold
unfortunately<00:01:09.500> next<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.799> send<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.640> my

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
unfortunately next up I send out my

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.450 
unfortunately next up I send out my
delta<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.530> seems<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.159> strange

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
delta which seems a bit of a strange

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.280 
delta which seems a bit of a strange
choice<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.060> i<00:01:15.090> figured<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:15.930> it's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
choice but i figured that you know it's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
choice but i figured that you know it's
probably<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.680> fastest<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.729> my

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
probably the fastest on what is my

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
probably the fastest on what is my
fastest<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> team<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.810> i<00:01:19.439> figured<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.830> he

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
fastest on the team so i figured that he

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.050 
fastest on the team so i figured that he
liked<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.070> best<00:01:20.280> chance<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> take<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.909> with

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
liked the best chance to take out with

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.440 
liked the best chance to take out with
an<00:01:21.150> air<00:01:21.299> /<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.979> shall<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> sue<00:01:24.030> butler

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
an air / so we shall have to sue butler

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.410 
an air / so we shall have to sue butler
on<00:01:24.689> where<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.700> obviously<00:01:26.700> droughts<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.330> up

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
on where and obviously droughts going up

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700 
on where and obviously droughts going up
which<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.630> gonna<00:01:27.720> help<00:01:27.960> us<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.170> again<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.680> we

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
which is gonna help us out again if we

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.609 
which is gonna help us out again if we
have<00:01:28.920> any<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:29.189> pokemon<00:01:29.610> coming<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.619> he's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
have any more pokemon coming in and he's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.550 
have any more pokemon coming in and he's
faster<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.070> me<00:01:32.250> which<00:01:32.369> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> sucks<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> he

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
faster than me which kind of sucks so he

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
faster than me which kind of sucks so he
goes<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> waterfall<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:36.180> does<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.200> lot

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
goes to the waterfall which does a lot

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.749 
goes to the waterfall which does a lot
of<00:01:37.500> damage<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.920> debt<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.280> Charizard

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
of damage for debt on my Charizard

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.880 
of damage for debt on my Charizard
because<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> defense<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> Pokemon<00:01:40.200> so

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because it's not a defense in Pokemon so

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.289 
because it's not a defense in Pokemon so
then<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> air<00:01:41.220> /<00:01:41.460> finally<00:01:41.909> takes<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
then the air / finally takes out the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.770 
then the air / finally takes out the
Gyarados<00:01:43.130> fortunately<00:01:44.130> huh<00:01:44.520> almost<00:01:45.420> didn't

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
Gyarados fortunately huh almost didn't

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.109 
Gyarados fortunately huh almost didn't
take<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.640> then<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> says<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> it's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
take it out then it says that it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
take it out then it says that it's
Gardevoir<00:01:48.799> which<00:01:49.799> i<00:01:49.950> figure<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.729> i

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
Gardevoir which i figure you know i

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.550 
Gardevoir which i figure you know i
think<00:01:50.850> i<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.509> fireblast<00:01:51.840> since<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
think i can get with a fireblast since I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.880 
think i can get with a fireblast since I
mean<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.799> hope<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.040> faster<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> do

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
mean with hope you faster and that I do

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.380 
mean with hope you faster and that I do
which<00:01:55.890> thankfully<00:01:56.520> takes<00:01:56.820> out<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:56.969> Gardevoir

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
which thankfully takes out the Gardevoir

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.050 
which thankfully takes out the Gardevoir
one<00:01:57.540> hit<00:01:58.009> which<00:01:59.009> turns<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.430> his<00:01:59.670> aura<00:01:59.820> walk

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
one hit which turns into his aura walk

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060 
one hit which turns into his aura walk
blah<00:02:00.689> blah<00:02:00.869> blah

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.380 

and<00:02:03.730> then<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:06.070> have<00:02:06.190> Blaziken<00:02:06.640> coming<00:02:06.909> out<00:02:07.000> and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
and then we have Blaziken coming out and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.859 
and then we have Blaziken coming out and
I<00:02:08.020> figure<00:02:08.470> I'd<00:02:09.070> never<00:02:09.399> be<00:02:09.550> faster<00:02:09.789> or<00:02:10.090> not<00:02:10.330> he

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
I figure I'd never be faster or not he

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.170 
I figure I'd never be faster or not he
megavolts<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.470> blizzcon<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.700> I'm<00:02:12.790> pretty<00:02:12.940> sure

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
megavolts is blizzcon so I'm pretty sure

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.000 
megavolts is blizzcon so I'm pretty sure
he's<00:02:13.209> naturally<00:02:13.630> faster<00:02:13.990> than<00:02:14.200> me<00:02:14.320> when<00:02:14.890> I'm

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
he's naturally faster than me when I'm

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.850 
he's naturally faster than me when I'm
not<00:02:15.160> sure<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> air<00:02:16.120> /

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
not sure I was going for the air /

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.080 
not sure I was going for the air /
however<00:02:17.860> as<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.070> think<00:02:18.280> we'll<00:02:18.370> find<00:02:18.459> out<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.820> I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
however as I think we'll find out now I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.330 
however as I think we'll find out now I
know<00:02:19.870> why<00:02:20.020> I'm<00:02:20.140> faster<00:02:20.560> which<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.830> strange

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
know why I'm faster which is strange

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.880 
know why I'm faster which is strange
since<00:02:21.840> usually<00:02:22.840> mega<00:02:22.990> Blaziken<00:02:23.290> faster<00:02:23.709> so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
since usually mega Blaziken faster so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.320 
since usually mega Blaziken faster so
it's<00:02:24.040> probably<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.580> know<00:02:24.610> hasn't<00:02:25.240> got

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it's probably not you know hasn't got

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.800 
it's probably not you know hasn't got
maximum<00:02:25.720> speed<00:02:26.050> IVs<00:02:26.320> or<00:02:26.590> something<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:26.950> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
maximum speed IVs or something like that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.420 
maximum speed IVs or something like that
so<00:02:28.810> then<00:02:29.020> he<00:02:29.680> sent<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.950> as<00:02:30.070> Nova<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.010> i<00:02:33.040> figured

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
so then he sent it as Nova so i figured

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.550 
so then he sent it as Nova so i figured
that<00:02:33.459> i<00:02:33.610> switch<00:02:34.000> out<00:02:34.180> now<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.600> go<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.840> think<00:02:35.470> i

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
that i switch out now and go to think i

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
that i switch out now and go to think i
went<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.830> my<00:02:35.950> aurorus<00:02:36.459> which<00:02:36.820> indeed<00:02:37.450> no<00:02:37.660> I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
went to my aurorus which indeed no I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.630 
went to my aurorus which indeed no I
guess<00:02:37.900> my<00:02:38.020> still<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.320> on<00:02:38.410> sorry<00:02:38.650> which<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.520> why

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
guess my still be on sorry which is why

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.910 
guess my still be on sorry which is why
I<00:02:39.670> would<00:02:39.910> Ragan<00:02:40.300> killer<00:02:40.540> he<00:02:41.320> goes<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.680> an<00:02:41.770> air

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
I would Ragan killer he goes for an air

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.680 
I would Ragan killer he goes for an air
/<00:02:42.190> rather<00:02:42.730> than<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.970> dragon-type<00:02:43.420> move

anything like that which doesn't do too

much<00:02:45.400> damage<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.790> sylveon<00:02:46.270> because<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.660> a

how you say at dinner anyway so he goes

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.410 
how you say at dinner anyway so he goes
for<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.370> moon<00:02:51.520> glass<00:02:51.700> which<00:02:51.940> takes<00:02:52.180> out<00:02:52.300> noise

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
for a moon glass which takes out noise

when<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.170> hit<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:54.340> no<00:02:54.489> evil<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.760> fated<00:02:55.090> and

when in one hit so no evil is fated and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.420 
when in one hit so no evil is fated and
then<00:02:57.370> sunlight<00:02:57.970> fades<00:02:58.150> etc<00:02:59.070> then<00:03:00.070> he<00:03:00.190> sends

then sunlight fades etc then he sends

then sunlight fades etc then he sends

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
steel-type moves against sylveon so I

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.190

makes sense so he then uses flash can
