00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.740
 Produced by NOWNESS 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.920
 Works by David Gelb 

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.530
 Potato flavor changes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.322
 Different cooking styles are different 

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:20.389
 Can be steamed to cook 

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.133
 Can be roasted or fried 

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.563
 Can also make mashed potatoes 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 There are too many practices for potatoes. 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.520
 Sometimes I still make potato ice cream 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.731
 I really did it two years ago. 

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.171
 I made a potato ice cream. 

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.082
 But I think it’s time to discover new ways to cook potatoes. 

00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:39.965
 My French chefs 

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:44.801
 Teach me to first "hunting" every day. 

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.328
 Getting raw materials 

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:52.595
 If there is no unique, highest quality material 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.093
 It means nothing 

00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:55.285
 Nothing 

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.983
 If there are only fresh chicken sprouted potatoes or broken carrots 

00:00:57.983 --> 00:00:59.292
 Then I can't do anything. 

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.494
 I am not a magician. 

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.726
 Can't change 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.880
 Today I am going to meet Alex Wesier. 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.243
 I have been working with him for a long time. 

00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:12.140
 For me, the potato he planted is the best. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.847
 This is good 

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.636
 There is a big one here. 

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.454
 You have to pick the potato and talk to the farmer. 

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:31.694
 Have to ask him what advantages this potato has. 

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:37.555
 I always get a lot of inspiration when I spend time in the fields. 

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:43.167
 I hope that the food I make can immediately remind people of the origin of the ingredients. 

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.857
 I am very lucky to teach me the best chefs in France. 

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:50.014
 At that time, I worked at least 14 hours a day. 

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:51.729
 No complaints 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:52.815
 Tears swallowing in the stomach 

00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:53.962
 To cry, only to go home and cry 

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.292
 Never cry in the restaurant kitchen 

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:56.907
 I said so now when I work. 

00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:58.896
 "Don't cry, cry for a while." 

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:00.977
 "Wait back home and cry in bed." 

00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:02.379
 "Can't cry in the kitchen" 

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.074
 Believe me, I said this. 

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.736
 Can you make it? Not late? 

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:07.785
 What is the situation now? 

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:08.773
 Is there a problem? 

00:02:08.773 --> 00:02:09.959
 No problem with serving? 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.773
 Feeling OK? 

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:11.794
 Everyone feels good? 

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:12.573
 it is good 

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:16.223
 I hope to present the original flavor of the potato. 

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.804
 Not too much seasoning 

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:21.294
 The most important thing is of course the raw materials. 

00:02:21.294 --> 00:02:22.861
 There is also theoretical technology and actual cooking 

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:25.881
 The potato has to be done just right. 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.438
 The heat is just right 

00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:30.259
 Freshly baked, it’s delicious. 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.062
 You can't heat it up one day in advance. 

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:39.783
 Even this simple dish should be done at any time. 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.272
 This is very important 

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:46.177
 Of course, the taste is absolutely important 

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.688
 I will choose the right taste according to the taste. 

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.056
 How to do it, how to do it 

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:51.462
 what is interesting is 

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.259
 We have potatoes in three colors 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.633
 Looks great 

00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:02.150
 Stranded potato finger potato and purple potato 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.838
 This color reminds me of its origin 

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:11.447
 Like a mountain is where we went this morning. 

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.656
 You can feel it when you touch it. 

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:16.773
 Very sticky 

00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:19.015
 Because it contains creamy ingredients 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.220
 This kind of touch is more dry 

00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:30.710
 Also great 

00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:32.996
 - This is also great - this? 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.020
 I don't like that kind 

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:36.052
 Starch content is too high 

00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:38.054
 Too powdery 

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:40.506
 I think this is very suitable for making potato chips. 

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:41.683
 So 

00:03:41.683 --> 00:03:43.767
 Let's use French finger potato with a side dish. 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.760
 Of course
