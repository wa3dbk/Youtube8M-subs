00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
player comparison is coming out and I

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.350 
player comparison is coming out and I
thought<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.730> would<00:00:08.820> be<00:00:08.970> very<00:00:09.210> much

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
thought it would be very much

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.780 
thought it would be very much
appropriate<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.469> course<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.280> all<00:00:11.429> know<00:00:11.460> about

appropriate of course you all know about

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.730 
appropriate of course you all know about
Wayne<00:00:12.090> Rooney<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.809> thought<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.500> would<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
Wayne Rooney but I thought it would be

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.980 
Wayne Rooney but I thought it would be
appropriate<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.429> compare<00:00:14.969> two<00:00:15.269> such<00:00:15.570> players

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
appropriate to compare two such players

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.950 
appropriate to compare two such players
as<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.830> here<00:00:17.180> several<00:00:18.180> people<00:00:18.210> before

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
as we have up here several people before

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
as we have up here several people before
have<00:00:19.230> asked<00:00:19.529> me<00:00:19.650> hey<00:00:19.800> why<00:00:20.010> don't<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.279> compare

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670

Luis<00:00:21.029> Suarez<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.570> Wayne<00:00:21.900> Rooney<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
Luis Suarez and Wayne Rooney so I

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.679 
Luis Suarez and Wayne Rooney so I
thought<00:00:23.310> I'd<00:00:23.460> give<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> go<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.570> go

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
thought I'd give it a go and here we go

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.170

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
going to try to look at it again I'm a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.759 
going to try to look at it again I'm a
Liverpool<00:00:29.550> fan<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.769> Manchester

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

United I can't even begin to like that
team<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.520> takes<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.910> lot<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> bias

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

although you see Suarez at ijams look at
him<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.039> Liverpool<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:33.000> if<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.270> did<00:04:33.419> that

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
him and Liverpool so if you did that

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.749 
him and Liverpool so if you did that
times<00:04:33.930> for<00:04:34.349> that<00:04:34.560> would<00:04:34.710> be<00:04:34.800> around<00:04:35.039> 200<00:04:35.280> games

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759

Wayne<00:05:05.849> Rooney<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.330> better<00:05:06.690> player<00:05:07.520> just

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
Wayne Rooney is the better player just

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.550 
Wayne Rooney is the better player just
in<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:08.880> regard<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.300> he's<00:05:09.599> more<00:05:09.840> versatile

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
in the regard that he's more versatile

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.710 
in the regard that he's more versatile
and<00:05:10.830> more<00:05:10.979> round<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.610> complete<00:05:12.120> as<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.419> player

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and more round and complete as a player

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.809 
and more round and complete as a player
Wayne<00:05:13.409> Rooney<00:05:13.740> can<00:05:13.919> function<00:05:14.340> better<00:05:14.370> as<00:05:14.789> a

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
Wayne Rooney can function better as a

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.969 
Wayne Rooney can function better as a
single<00:05:15.360> striker<00:05:15.720> than<00:05:16.020> Luis<00:05:16.289> Suarez<00:05:16.710> can

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
single striker than Luis Suarez can

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.540 
single striker than Luis Suarez can
because<00:05:17.610> ultimately<00:05:18.259> Luis<00:05:19.259> Suarez<00:05:19.740> is<00:05:19.889> always

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
because ultimately Luis Suarez is always

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.860 
because ultimately Luis Suarez is always
going<00:05:20.699> to<00:05:20.789> be<00:05:20.819> looking<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.210> provide<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.690> goal

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
going to be looking to provide the goal

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.659 
going to be looking to provide the goal
and<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.229> while<00:05:22.470> he<00:05:22.740> may<00:05:22.949> pull<00:05:23.220> off<00:05:23.460> the

and the while he may pull off the

and the while he may pull off the
