00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
through it and with this because it's a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.719 
through it and with this because it's a
mud<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.869> consistency<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.009> thick<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> it's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
mud the consistency is so thick and it's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.510 
mud the consistency is so thick and it's
not<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.390> sucks<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.049> shampoo<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
not like it sucks up like shampoo so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
not like it sucks up like shampoo so
it's<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.119> difficult<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> through

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it's really difficult to get it through

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.819 
it's really difficult to get it through
my<00:01:25.409> hair<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.810> though<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.049> say<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829

my hair and so even though they say and
i<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> instructions<00:01:30.180> say<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
so the bentonite clay mask works great

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.250 
so the bentonite clay mask works great
on<00:04:12.380> my<00:04:12.620> skin<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.489> I'm<00:04:13.940> thinking<00:04:14.000> what<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:14.959> may

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
on my skin so I'm thinking what I may

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.730 
on my skin so I'm thinking what I may
try<00:04:15.440> to

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
try to

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.660 
try to
is<00:04:16.130> see<00:04:17.090> how<00:04:17.360> the<00:04:17.810> bentonite<00:04:18.320> clay<00:04:18.640> with<00:04:19.640> a

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
is see how the bentonite clay with a

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.910 
is see how the bentonite clay with a
little<00:04:19.910> elder<00:04:20.270> juice<00:04:20.540> at<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.989> works<00:04:21.620> with<00:04:21.770> my

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
little elder juice at it works with my

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.250 
little elder juice at it works with my
hair<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:22.310> haven't<00:04:22.640> revisited<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.510> for<00:04:24.140> my

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
note I did start diluting it after like

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.300 
note I did start diluting it after like
the<00:04:41.660> second<00:04:42.170> day<00:04:42.260> I<00:04:42.530> do<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.860> first<00:04:43.070> day<00:04:43.250> of

the second day I do that first day of

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.830 
the second day I do that first day of
the<00:04:43.430> three<00:04:43.610> watches<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.150> half<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.300> bottles<00:04:44.750> I

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
the three watches and half the bottles I

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.840 
the three watches and half the bottles I
was<00:04:44.990> like<00:04:45.110> yeah<00:04:45.500> that's<00:04:46.250> not<00:04:46.370> gonna<00:04:46.520> work<00:04:46.580> out

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
was like yeah that's not gonna work out

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.570 
was like yeah that's not gonna work out
for<00:04:47.030> me<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:47.840> did<00:04:48.260> start<00:04:48.500> diluting<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:49.280> but<00:04:49.700> I

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
for me so I did start diluting it but I

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.250 
for me so I did start diluting it but I
can't<00:04:52.580> really<00:04:52.880> say<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.630> it's<00:04:53.870> life-changing

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
can't really say that it's life-changing

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.770 
can't really say that it's life-changing
results<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.280> far<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.760> know<00:04:55.850> I'm<00:04:56.240> only<00:04:56.270> on<00:04:56.480> day

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
results so far I know I'm only on day

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.510 
results so far I know I'm only on day
three<00:04:57.080> still<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:57.950> four<00:04:58.160> more<00:04:58.280> days<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.670> go

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
three still have four more days to go

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.040 
three still have four more days to go
but<00:05:01.520> I'm<00:05:01.640> not<00:05:01.670> really<00:05:02.060> seeing<00:05:02.390> that<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.870> would

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
but I'm not really seeing that it would

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.280 
but I'm not really seeing that it would
be<00:05:03.200> worth<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.920> money<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.820> do<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.420> I'm

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
be worth the money to do this so I'm

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.530 
be worth the money to do this so I'm
going<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.680> finish<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.280> detox<00:05:07.760> process<00:05:08.060> with

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
bottles down which will probably be

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.390 
bottles down which will probably be
quickly<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:16.400> then<00:05:17.500> see<00:05:18.500> how<00:05:18.530> i<00:05:18.740> feel<00:05:19.040> about<00:05:19.100> it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
quickly and then see how i feel about it

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.180 
quickly and then see how i feel about it
then<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:19.880> then<00:05:20.780> i'm<00:05:20.870> going<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.080> switch<00:05:21.410> and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
then and then i'm going to switch and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.960 
then and then i'm going to switch and
try<00:05:22.970> using<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.630> bentonite<00:05:24.020> clay<00:05:24.580> for<00:05:25.580> my<00:05:25.700> hair

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
try using the bentonite clay for my hair

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.020 
try using the bentonite clay for my hair
for<00:05:26.540> about<00:05:26.750> a<00:05:26.930> month<00:05:27.230> and<00:05:27.560> then<00:05:28.400> I<00:05:28.430> can<00:05:28.730> kind<00:05:28.880> of

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
for about a month and then I can kind of

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.620 
for about a month and then I can kind of
compare<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.600> two<00:05:30.080> I<00:05:30.460> would<00:05:31.460> really<00:05:31.730> like<00:05:32.330> to

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
compare the two I would really like to

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.140 
compare the two I would really like to
just<00:05:32.660> go<00:05:33.080> ahead<00:05:33.170> and<00:05:33.290> use<00:05:33.530> this<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.190> because

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
just go ahead and use this and because

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150 
just go ahead and use this and because
I'm<00:05:35.270> really<00:05:35.660> about<00:05:35.840> things<00:05:36.170> that<00:05:36.350> can<00:05:36.890> serve

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
I'm really about things that can serve

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.190 
I'm really about things that can serve
more<00:05:37.640> than<00:05:37.670> one<00:05:37.910> purpose<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.450> since<00:05:39.050> i'm

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
more than one purpose and since i'm

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.110 
more than one purpose and since i'm
already<00:05:39.440> using<00:05:39.860> this<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.490> already<00:05:40.670> buying

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
already using this and already buying

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.330 
already using this and already buying
this<00:05:41.420> for<00:05:41.840> my<00:05:41.990> face<00:05:42.350> i<00:05:42.620> would<00:05:42.860> rather<00:05:43.010> just

this for my face i would rather just

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.800 
this for my face i would rather just
glitter<00:05:43.580> use<00:05:43.850> this<00:05:43.970> for<00:05:44.180> my<00:05:44.270> face<00:05:44.420> my<00:05:44.630> hair

instead of buying this and rank this

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.390 
instead of buying this and rank this
