00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.870 
chicken to make sure it's completely
cooked<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.410> can<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:48.920> by<00:02:49.070> cutting<00:02:49.400> into

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
cooked you can do that by cutting into

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.000 
cooked you can do that by cutting into
the<00:02:50.030> biggest<00:02:50.420> piece<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.080> tray<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.590> making

the biggest piece on the tray and making

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.430 
the biggest piece on the tray and making

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
sure the juice inside runs clear and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.920 
sure the juice inside runs clear and
there<00:02:54.590> are<00:02:54.740> no<00:02:54.950> signs<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.580> pink<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.570> also

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
there are no signs of pink you can also

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.340 
there are no signs of pink you can also
use<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.260> thermometer<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.600> 165<00:02:59.600> degrees<00:03:00.140> would

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
use a thermometer and 165 degrees would

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.180 
use a thermometer and 165 degrees would
mean<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:01.010> completely<00:03:01.430> cooked<00:03:01.730> and
