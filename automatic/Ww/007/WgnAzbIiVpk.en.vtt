00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
stream on Virtual DJ now you can have a

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.200 
stream on Virtual DJ now you can have a
probably<00:00:10.620> your<00:00:11.130> skin<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.670> different<00:00:11.880> than

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210

mine
but<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> procedure<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.769> pretty<00:00:14.130> much<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
but the procedure is pretty much the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.660 
but the procedure is pretty much the
same<00:00:15.049> you<00:00:16.049> go<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> record<00:00:16.740> tab<00:00:16.949> which<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
same you go to the record tab which is

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.320 
same you go to the record tab which is
over<00:00:18.330> here<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:19.189> sometimes<00:00:20.189> depending<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
over here or sometimes depending on the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.630 
over here or sometimes depending on the
skin<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.750> somewhere<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
skin is somewhere here just go to the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.310 
skin is somewhere here just go to the
record<00:00:24.060> tab<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> broadcast

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
record tab and then go to broadcast

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
record tab and then go to broadcast
right<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.210> then<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
right here and then you go to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.340 
right here and then you go to
configuration<00:00:31.320> right<00:00:32.279> there

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
configuration right there

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.780 
configuration right there
now<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.920> you're<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.460> use<00:00:35.640> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
now if you're going to use your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.260 
now if you're going to use your
microphone<00:00:36.260> then<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.890> use<00:00:38.100> master<00:00:38.879> plus

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
microphone then you use master plus

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
microphone then you use master plus
microphone<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> note<00:00:42.770> your<00:00:43.770> microphone

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
microphone on a note your microphone

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.500 
microphone on a note your microphone
needs<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.590> button<00:00:47.510> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
needs to have an on and off button so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.000 
needs to have an on and off button so
it's<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.899> turned<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.739> because

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's not turned on all that because

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.740 
it's not turned on all that because
unmute<00:00:50.340> well<00:00:50.460> DJ<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.879> turned<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> time

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
unmute well DJ is turned on all the time

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
unmute well DJ is turned on all the time
so<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> capability

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so if you don't have that capability

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.340 
so if you don't have that capability
just<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.379> master<00:00:56.030> okay<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.930> case<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
just use master okay so in this case I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.580 
just use master okay so in this case I
use<00:00:58.530> master<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> microphone<00:01:00.440> I'll<00:01:01.440> leave

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
use master and microphone I'll leave

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.759 
use master and microphone I'll leave
that<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.770> default<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.809> prefer<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.080> uncheck

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that as default I prefer to uncheck

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.330 
that as default I prefer to uncheck
where<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> says<00:01:05.250> auto<00:01:05.460> start<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> actually

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
where it says auto start so it actually

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.899 
where it says auto start so it actually
starts<00:01:08.670> transmitting<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.390> moment<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.930> hit

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
starts transmitting the moment I hit

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.260 
starts transmitting the moment I hit
