now<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.640> time<00:00:05.819> round<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.180> noticed<00:00:06.480> something

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
now this time round I noticed something

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.770 
now this time round I noticed something
while<00:00:07.290> watching<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:08.250> interview<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:09.300> Jeremy

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
while watching an interview that Jeremy

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.970 
while watching an interview that Jeremy
van<00:00:09.960> Hooser<00:00:10.200> did<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:11.450> GameTrailers<00:00:12.450> calm<00:00:12.980> so

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
van Hooser did with GameTrailers calm so

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.110 
van Hooser did with GameTrailers calm so
I'm<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> show<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.580> found<00:00:14.820> and

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I'm going to show you what I found and

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.490 
I'm going to show you what I found and
I'll<00:00:15.240> talk<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.900> afterwards

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I'll talk about it afterwards

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:57.010 
I'll talk about it afterwards
here's<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> year<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:17.910> snippet

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.410 

so<00:00:57.950> there<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.160> go<00:00:58.250> it's<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.150> middle

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
so there you go it's just in the middle

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.180 
so there you go it's just in the middle
of<00:00:59.450> the<00:00:59.570> screen<00:00:59.780> at<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.170> background<00:01:00.620> as<00:01:01.100> I

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
of the screen at the background as I

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.860 
of the screen at the background as I
slowed<00:01:01.580> it<00:01:01.610> down<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.210> can<00:01:02.360> see<00:01:02.570> there<00:01:02.840> that

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
slowed it down you can see there that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.740 
slowed it down you can see there that
the<00:01:03.110> scientist<00:01:03.590> is<00:01:03.830> using<00:01:04.190> a<00:01:04.250> heel<00:01:04.520> beat<00:01:04.760> so

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
the scientist is using a heel beat so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.900 
the scientist is using a heel beat so
does<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.050> mean<00:01:06.260> that<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.130> hill<00:01:07.310> station<00:01:07.580> is

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
does this mean that the hill station is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.480 
does this mean that the hill station is
now<00:01:08.150> going<00:01:08.480> to<00:01:08.570> be<00:01:08.660> retired<00:01:09.080> there's<00:01:10.070> no<00:01:10.280> need

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
now going to be retired there's no need

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.200 
now going to be retired there's no need
for<00:01:10.520> anymore

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
for anymore

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.300 
for anymore
I'm<00:01:11.450> not<00:01:11.720> too<00:01:11.870> sure<00:01:11.900> maybe<00:01:12.440> it'd<00:01:12.860> still<00:01:13.250> be

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
I'm not too sure maybe it'd still be

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.610 
I'm not too sure maybe it'd still be
incorporated<00:01:14.240> because<00:01:15.080> if<00:01:15.230> you<00:01:15.320> think<00:01:15.470> about

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
incorporated because if you think about

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.530 
incorporated because if you think about
it<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:17.060> sunflower<00:01:18.160> has<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.400> healing<00:01:19.580> pot

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
it the the sunflower has the healing pot

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.480 
it the the sunflower has the healing pot
and<00:01:21.130> also<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:24.110> heal<00:01:24.290> beam<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:24.740> well<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.280> maybe

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and also the heal beam as well so maybe

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.430 
and also the heal beam as well so maybe
because<00:01:26.300> it's<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.510> opposite<00:01:26.870> way<00:01:26.960> for<00:01:27.140> an<00:01:27.320> to

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
because it's the opposite way for an to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.770 
because it's the opposite way for an to
a<00:01:27.470> degree<00:01:27.680> that's<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.760> reason<00:01:29.030> why<00:01:29.150> now<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
a degree that's the reason why now the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.040 
a degree that's the reason why now the
scientist<00:01:30.200> has<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.440> heal<00:01:30.860> beam<00:01:31.490> instead<00:01:32.050> so

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
scientist has a heal beam instead so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
scientist has a heal beam instead so
it'll<00:01:33.170> be<00:01:33.229> quite<00:01:33.380> interesting<00:01:33.830> what<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.010> you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
it'll be quite interesting what do you

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.590 
it'll be quite interesting what do you
think<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.370> new<00:01:34.430> ability<00:01:34.760> that<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
think of this new ability that the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.510 
think of this new ability that the
scientist<00:01:36.080> has<00:01:36.290> I've<00:01:37.160> seen<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:37.940> healing<00:01:39.520> I've

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
scientist has I've seen it healing I've

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.700 
scientist has I've seen it healing I've
seen<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:40.880> healing<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.900> clip<00:01:42.320> there<00:01:42.530> I

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710
