which a wild adult steelhead that have

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.640 
which a wild adult steelhead that have
recently<00:00:24.490> spawned<00:00:25.050> steelhead<00:00:26.050> have<00:00:26.260> a<00:00:26.289> unique

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
recently spawned steelhead have a unique

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.290 
recently spawned steelhead have a unique
lifecycle<00:00:27.460> where<00:00:27.609> they<00:00:27.699> don't<00:00:27.820> have<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.060> die

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
lifecycle where they don't have to die

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.599 
lifecycle where they don't have to die
after<00:00:28.570> they<00:00:28.810> spawn<00:00:29.020> like<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.380> salmon<00:00:29.680> does<00:00:30.010> so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
after they spawn like a salmon does so

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.279 
after they spawn like a salmon does so
with<00:00:30.789> this<00:00:30.910> kilts<00:00:31.390> they'll<00:00:31.660> drift<00:00:31.869> back<00:00:32.079> out

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
with this kilts they'll drift back out

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:33.840 
with this kilts they'll drift back out
and<00:00:32.439> act<00:00:32.529> like<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:32.679> giant<00:00:32.949> smoke<00:00:33.370> trying<00:00:33.699> to<00:00:33.760> go

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
and act like a giant smoke trying to go

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.880 
and act like a giant smoke trying to go
back<00:00:34.030> out<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.269> the<00:00:34.479> ocean<00:00:34.510> you<00:00:35.469> know<00:00:35.589> you<00:00:35.649> can

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
back out to the ocean you know you can

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.469 
back out to the ocean you know you can
imagine<00:00:35.979> the<00:00:36.399> journey<00:00:36.640> they<00:00:36.850> had<00:00:36.879> coming<00:00:37.329> back

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.479 
imagine the journey they had coming back

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.599 
imagine the journey they had coming back
from<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.749> ocean<00:00:38.170> fighting<00:00:38.769> the<00:00:38.889> Predators<00:00:39.460> or

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
from the ocean fighting the Predators or

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.309 
from the ocean fighting the Predators or
the<00:00:39.670> current<00:00:40.059> and<00:00:40.389> it's<00:00:40.539> spawning<00:00:41.109> in<00:00:41.229> the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:41.319 
the current and it's spawning in the

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.200 
the current and it's spawning in the
wild<00:00:41.710> when<00:00:42.219> they're<00:00:42.339> drifting<00:00:42.550> back<00:00:42.850> out<00:00:43.059> to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
wild when they're drifting back out to

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.180 
wild when they're drifting back out to
the<00:00:43.300> ocean<00:00:43.449> there's<00:00:44.139> no<00:00:44.319> energy<00:00:44.530> left<00:00:44.859> in<00:00:45.069> them

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
the ocean there's no energy left in them

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.939 
the ocean there's no energy left in them
so<00:00:45.489> we<00:00:45.639> intercept<00:00:46.179> them<00:00:46.530> after<00:00:47.530> they<00:00:47.649> spawn

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
so we intercept them after they spawn

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.239 
so we intercept them after they spawn
hold<00:00:48.639> them<00:00:48.819> in<00:00:48.940> art<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.329> our<00:00:49.479> facility

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
hold them in art on our facility

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.049 
hold them in art on our facility
recondition<00:00:51.249> them<00:00:51.370> hope<00:00:51.609> they<00:00:51.789> get<00:00:51.909> their

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
recondition them hope they get their

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.000 
recondition them hope they get their
eggs<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.479> regenerate<00:00:53.049> and<00:00:53.170> then<00:00:53.530> release<00:00:53.799> them

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
eggs to regenerate and then release them

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.729 
eggs to regenerate and then release them
back<00:00:54.129> into<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.459> system<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:56.079> saw<00:00:56.260> these<00:00:56.469> fish

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
back into the system we saw these fish

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.439 
back into the system we saw these fish
leaving<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.370> river<00:00:57.519> system<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.119> knowing

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
leaving the river system and knowing

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.520 
leaving the river system and knowing
that<00:00:58.479> they<00:00:58.629> don't<00:00:58.809> seem<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.049> be<00:00:59.139> reaching

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
that they don't seem to be reaching

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.889 
that they don't seem to be reaching
spawning<00:00:59.859> so<00:01:00.129> how<00:01:00.280> can<00:01:00.459> we<00:01:00.549> help<00:01:00.670> them<00:01:00.850> out<00:01:01.059> 53

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
spawning so how can we help them out 53

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.809 
spawning so how can we help them out 53
and<00:01:02.469> rather<00:01:02.979> than<00:01:03.190> put<00:01:03.369> another<00:01:03.549> hatchery

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
and rather than put another hatchery

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.790 
and rather than put another hatchery
setting<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.449> like<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.720> do<00:01:04.870> for<00:01:05.020> salmon<00:01:05.440> we're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
setting in like you do for salmon we're

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.890 
setting in like you do for salmon we're
using<00:01:05.980> their<00:01:06.220> unique<00:01:06.490> life<00:01:06.700> cycle<00:01:07.150> yeah<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:07.780> we

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
using their unique life cycle yeah so we

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.510 
using their unique life cycle yeah so we
intercept<00:01:08.350> them<00:01:08.560> we<00:01:09.070> gave<00:01:09.160> them<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.340> safe

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
intercept them we gave them a safe

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.580 
intercept them we gave them a safe
environment<00:01:09.820> we<00:01:10.210> treat<00:01:10.420> them<00:01:10.600> for<00:01:11.230> any<00:01:11.350> type

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
environment we treat them for any type

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.650 
environment we treat them for any type
of<00:01:11.620> diseases<00:01:12.070> give<00:01:12.850> them<00:01:12.940> some<00:01:13.060> antibiotics

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
of diseases give them some antibiotics

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.810 
of diseases give them some antibiotics
in<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.840> feed<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.590> then<00:01:15.070> again<00:01:15.370> let<00:01:15.580> them<00:01:15.700> go

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
in the feed and then again let them go

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.280 
in the feed and then again let them go
back<00:01:16.000> out<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.210> do<00:01:16.390> their<00:01:16.510> thing

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
back out and do their thing

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.560 
back out and do their thing
got<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.650> favor<00:01:19.950> thee

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570

five four or five three point or we'll

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.070 
five four or five three point or we'll
put<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> pit<00:01:32.880> tag<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.540> our<00:01:33.630> steelhead

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
put a pit tag in all of our steelhead

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.630 
put a pit tag in all of our steelhead
that<00:01:34.230> we're<00:01:34.350> working<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.770> today<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.550> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that we're working on today just to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
that we're working on today just to
track<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.510> evaluation<00:01:37.080> on<00:01:37.170> how

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
track and to get some evaluation on how

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.900 
track and to get some evaluation on how
they're<00:01:37.470> doing<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.370> is<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.760> way<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
they're doing well this is just a way to

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.400 
they're doing well this is just a way to
name<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> fish<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> fish<00:01:40.200> first

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
name the fish and when the fish first

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.260 
name the fish and when the fish first
comes<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.980> will<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.400> myristic<00:01:41.730> so<00:01:42.000> we'll<00:01:42.120> do

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
comes in will do myristic so we'll do

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.790 
comes in will do myristic so we'll do
some<00:01:42.450> lengths<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.930> weights<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.410> scale

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
some lengths and weights and scale

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.550 
some lengths and weights and scale
sample<00:01:44.310> DNA<00:01:44.730> samples<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.510> with<00:01:45.690> this<00:01:45.810> tag<00:01:46.080> we

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
sample DNA samples and with this tag we

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.290 
sample DNA samples and with this tag we
can<00:01:46.740> link<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> back<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.460> original<00:01:47.580> fish<00:01:48.030> so

when<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:32.450> release<00:03:32.720> them<00:03:32.870> they<00:03:32.930> look<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.349> the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
when we release them they look like the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.050 
when we release them they look like the
fresh<00:03:33.769> fish<00:03:33.980> out<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> ocean<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:34.909> they're

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
fresh fish out of the ocean so they're

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.190 
fresh fish out of the ocean so they're
big<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.510> they're<00:03:35.599> they're<00:03:35.959> bright<00:03:36.170> and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
big and they're they're bright and

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:53.390 
big and they're they're bright and
they're<00:03:36.440> full<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.739> eggs

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.920 

let's<00:03:54.400> go<00:03:54.489> back<00:03:54.670> into<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:54.939> tributary<00:03:55.480> in

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
let's go back into the tributary in

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.660 
let's go back into the tributary in
another<00:03:56.319> couple<00:03:56.709> months<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.159> start<00:03:57.489> spawning

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
another couple months and start spawning

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.460 
another couple months and start spawning
after<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.329> he'll<00:03:58.569> drift<00:03:58.810> back<00:03:58.959> out<00:03:59.200> like

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
after that he'll drift back out like

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.380 
after that he'll drift back out like
Smoltz<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.099> we'll<00:04:00.519> see<00:04:00.670> them<00:04:00.819> March<00:04:01.090> through

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
Smoltz and we'll see them March through

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.360 
Smoltz and we'll see them March through
June<00:04:01.659> back<00:04:02.170> in<00:04:02.349> our<00:04:02.470> system<00:04:02.799> again<00:04:03.040> hopefully

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
June back in our system again hopefully

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.030 
June back in our system again hopefully
ready<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.090> go<00:04:04.780> through<00:04:04.900> another<00:04:05.140> cycle<00:04:05.230> had<00:04:05.860> we

ready to go through another cycle had we

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
would have died they would have perished

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.819 
would have died they would have perished
instead<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.390> good<00:04:10.840> number<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.200> them<00:04:11.409> are<00:04:11.590> going

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
instead a good number of them are going

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.920 
instead a good number of them are going
to<00:04:11.950> go<00:04:12.069> back<00:04:12.280> upstream<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.030> spawn<00:04:13.209> again<00:04:13.420> with

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
to go back upstream and spawn again with

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.600 
to go back upstream and spawn again with
this<00:04:14.170> we<00:04:14.379> allow<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.620> fish<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.920> go<00:04:15.159> back<00:04:15.370> out

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
this we allow the fish to go back out

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.300 
this we allow the fish to go back out
and<00:04:15.640> spawn<00:04:16.269> in<00:04:16.780> their<00:04:16.989> own<00:04:17.169> habitat<00:04:17.709> pick

their own mates pick their own areas and
