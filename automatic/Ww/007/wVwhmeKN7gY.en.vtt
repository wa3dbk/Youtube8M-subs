teleports you to tempest Bay now if you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
teleports you to tempest Bay now if you
can<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.830> tempest<00:01:14.220> bay<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:15.330> ahead<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.750> do

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
can get to tempest bay go ahead and do

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.859 
can get to tempest bay go ahead and do
this<00:01:16.020> method<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.070> start<00:01:17.490> at

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
this method and you can start at

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.950 
this method and you can start at
extremely<00:01:18.869> low<00:01:19.020> level<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.640> imagine<00:01:21.390> most<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
extremely low level so I imagine most of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
extremely low level so I imagine most of
you<00:01:22.020> would<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> start<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:23.070> around<00:01:23.460> level

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you would want to start at around level

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.910 
you would want to start at around level
10<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.439> maybe<00:01:25.890> even<00:01:26.040> 20<00:01:26.820> 30<00:01:27.150> or<00:01:27.270> whatever

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
10 or so or maybe even 20 30 or whatever

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.510 
10 or so or maybe even 20 30 or whatever
but<00:01:28.970> now<00:01:30.740> what<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> do

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but now what you're going to have to do

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
but now what you're going to have to do
is<00:01:32.790> right-click<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.259> character

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is right-click up on your character

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.569 
is right-click up on your character
portrait<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:37.380> doesn't<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.400> my

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
portrait now it doesn't have it for my

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
portrait now it doesn't have it for my
character<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.570> max<00:01:39.810> level<00:01:40.259> but

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
character because I'm max level but

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
character because I'm max level but
normally<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.579> will<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> option<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
normally you will have the option to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.999 
normally you will have the option to
turn<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.579> sidekick<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.650> whenever<00:01:46.650> you<00:01:46.770> turn

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
turn on sidekick and whenever you turn

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.640 
turn on sidekick and whenever you turn
that<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.700> allows<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> mentor<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.940 
that on it allows you to mentor up and
levels<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.150> what<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> turn<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
levels so what you do is you turn on the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
levels so what you do is you turn on the
sidekicking<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.899> group<00:01:55.200> with

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
sidekicking and then you group with

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.889 
sidekicking and then you group with
somebody<00:01:55.920> that's<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.340> high<00:01:56.490> level<00:01:56.850> say<00:01:57.270> level
