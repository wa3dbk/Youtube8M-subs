when<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> hit<00:01:20.070> games<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.330> watchdogs

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
when I hit games and the other watchdogs

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
when I hit games and the other watchdogs
and<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.560> click<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:23.190> arrow<00:01:23.220> next

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.990 
and going to click this down arrow next
to<00:01:23.909> play<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.659> keep<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.920> verify<00:01:26.310> files

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to play so keep that and go verify files
