00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the circuit here if not that's okay just

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
the circuit here if not that's okay just
pass<00:00:42.030> them<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.300> where<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.600> come<00:00:42.809> back

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
pass them up where you can come back

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
pass them up where you can come back
doesn't<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.469> matter<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.670> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
doesn't really matter it's not like it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
doesn't really matter it's not like it's
going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> impact<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.809> sales<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.320> much<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
going to impact your sales that much you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.979 
going to impact your sales that much you
know<00:00:46.770> fifty<00:00:47.160> gold<00:00:47.309> maybe<00:00:47.780> depending<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
know fifty gold maybe depending on the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.049 
know fifty gold maybe depending on the
item<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> higher<00:00:50.370> population<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
item but the higher population the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.610 
item but the higher population the
servers<00:00:51.360> will<00:00:51.629> probably<00:00:51.899> work<00:00:51.989> better<00:00:52.199> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
servers will probably work better just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.920 
servers will probably work better just
because<00:00:52.920> stuff<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> sell<00:00:53.610> quicker

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
what they say the average is something a
little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.079> lower<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.090> with

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
little bit lower but as you can see with

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.660 
little bit lower but as you can see with
the<00:01:36.450> mad<00:01:36.600> cause<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.020> me<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.439> prices<00:01:37.799> there

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the mad cause for me the prices there

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.950 
the mad cause for me the prices there
was<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> couple<00:01:39.299> items<00:01:39.450> missing

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
was actually a couple items missing

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
was actually a couple items missing
that's<00:01:40.650> why<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.220> lower<00:01:41.400> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's why it's a little bit lower so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
that's why it's a little bit lower so
you<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> expect<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.899> honest<00:01:43.290> but

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you got to expect that to be honest but

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.550 
you got to expect that to be honest but
