00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
there's two carving first that's a solid

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:47.830 
there's two carving first that's a solid
piece<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.449> talking<00:00:24.750> through<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:40.910> system

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.920 

straight<00:00:49.700> they're<00:00:50.700> ceramics<00:00:51.360> probably<00:00:51.780> like

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
straight they're ceramics probably like

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
straight they're ceramics probably like
six<00:00:52.739> hundred<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> thousand<00:00:53.760> great<00:00:53.940> it's

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
six hundred to a thousand great it's

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
six hundred to a thousand great it's
probably<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> cheap<00:00:55.379> version<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
probably it's just the cheap version of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.170 
probably it's just the cheap version of
the<00:00:57.859> sharp<00:00:58.859> maker<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:01.520> there's<00:01:02.520> only<00:01:02.640> 20<00:01:03.000> bucks

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the sharp maker so there's only 20 bucks

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:22.640 
the sharp maker so there's only 20 bucks
sportsman's<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:20.990> find<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.439> keep

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
sportsman's I find that if you keep

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.960 
sportsman's I find that if you keep
going<00:01:22.920> lighter<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> lighter<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> doesn't

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
going lighter and lighter it doesn't

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
going lighter and lighter it doesn't
work<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> keep<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
work you want to keep and you got to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
work you want to keep and you got to
keep<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> blade<00:01:29.070> straight<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> won't<00:01:30.329> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
keep the blade straight or it won't so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:43.030 
keep the blade straight or it won't so
at<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:30.869> angles<00:01:41.299> that's<00:01:42.299> pretty<00:01:42.540> good

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
at the right angles that's pretty good

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:56.170 
at the right angles that's pretty good
it's<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> pretty<00:01:44.130> good

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.330 

Cold<00:01:57.180> Steel<00:01:57.299> makes<00:01:57.840> another<00:01:58.340> bushcrafting

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
Cold Steel makes another bushcrafting

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.899 
Cold Steel makes another bushcrafting
knife<00:02:03.110> they<00:02:04.110> call<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.590> Bushman<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.700> can

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
knife they call it Bushman and you can

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
knife they call it Bushman and you can
actually<00:02:06.119> put<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> stick<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> handle<00:02:07.799> it's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
actually put a stick in the handle it's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.820 
actually put a stick in the handle it's
a<00:02:08.039> fixed<00:02:08.340> blade

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.740 

this<00:02:13.830> isn't<00:02:14.190> factory<00:02:14.610> edge<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.330> actually

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this isn't factory edge it was actually

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.199 
this isn't factory edge it was actually
repro<00:02:16.319> filed<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> convex<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.060> that's

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
repro filed to a convex so that's

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.570 
repro filed to a convex so that's
probably<00:02:18.510> why<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.069> cutting<00:02:20.069> wood<00:02:20.340> as

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
probably why it's not cutting wood as

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.900 
probably why it's not cutting wood as
well<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.390> would<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.700> still<00:02:23.849> going

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
well as it would but this is still going

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.520 
well as it would but this is still going
through<00:02:24.180> pretty<00:02:24.480> good<00:02:24.720> taking<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.319> big

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
through pretty good taking out big

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.910 
through pretty good taking out big
chunks<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.790> knife<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.299> for<00:02:27.510> trade<00:02:27.930> or<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.319> so

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
chunks this knife is for trade or so so

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:43.839 
chunks this knife is for trade or so so
if<00:02:29.760> you're<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.630> dibs<00:02:30.989> comment<00:02:31.739> below

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.640 

it's<00:02:44.849> got<00:02:45.150> probably<00:02:45.599> low<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.170> medium<00:02:46.380> weight

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it's got probably low to medium weight

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:56.229 
it's got probably low to medium weight
for<00:02:47.640> chopping<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.380> still<00:02:49.380> do

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:11.229 

one<00:02:57.500> four<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:58.829> one<00:02:58.859> six<00:02:59.359> crop<00:03:00.359> whatever<00:03:01.079> I

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.410 

like<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.420> cold<00:03:12.630> steel<00:03:12.989> says<00:03:13.850> our<00:03:14.850> knives<00:03:15.180> are

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
like how cold steel says our knives are

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.830 
like how cold steel says our knives are
the<00:03:15.750> best<00:03:16.069> yeah<00:03:17.180> that's<00:03:18.180> kind<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.480> why<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.600> don't

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the best yeah that's kind of why I don't

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.349 
the best yeah that's kind of why I don't
respect<00:03:19.109> them<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> company<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:22.970> we<00:03:23.970> don't<00:03:24.180> I

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
respect them as a company but we don't I

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.090 
respect them as a company but we don't I
still<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.079> their<00:03:25.350> knives<00:03:25.590> they<00:03:25.920> make

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
still I like their knives they make

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.710 
still I like their knives they make
really<00:03:26.400> good<00:03:26.639> knives<00:03:26.880> especially<00:03:27.540> with<00:03:27.660> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
really good knives especially with the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.900 
really good knives especially with the
Triad<00:03:28.049> lock<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.950> Ram<00:03:29.220> works<00:03:29.549> really<00:03:29.700> good

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
Triad lock this Ram works really good

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:41.330 
Triad lock this Ram works really good
too<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:31.410> cold<00:03:31.680> Steel's<00:03:40.100> close<00:03:41.100> and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
too but I like cold Steel's close and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.540 
too but I like cold Steel's close and
see<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.609> can<00:03:41.760> break<00:03:42.000> it

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.380 

that<00:03:50.550> was<00:03:50.670> pretty<00:03:50.849> cool<00:03:51.830> now<00:03:52.830> but<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.390> this

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
that was pretty cool now but on this

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.920 
that was pretty cool now but on this
piece<00:03:54.629> of<00:03:54.780> wood<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.050> really<00:03:55.940> really<00:03:56.940> solid<00:03:57.830> so

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
piece of wood is really really solid so

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.440 
piece of wood is really really solid so
the<00:04:00.930> RAM<00:04:01.170> lock<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.769> almost<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.849> almost<00:04:02.910> need
