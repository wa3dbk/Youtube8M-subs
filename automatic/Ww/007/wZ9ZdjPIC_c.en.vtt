now<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.700> notice<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
now first of all going to notice that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.030 
now first of all going to notice that
this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:33.930> smaller<00:00:34.320> than<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.579> iPad<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
this is a lot smaller than the iPad is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.860 
this is a lot smaller than the iPad is
way<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.309> smaller<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:39.090> also<00:00:39.829> very<00:00:40.829> thin<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
way way smaller it's also very thin I

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
way way smaller it's also very thin I
would<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.320> thinner<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.370> fin

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
would say it's thinner or just as fin

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.900 
would say it's thinner or just as fin
and<00:00:45.770> it's<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> lot<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> white<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.700> one
