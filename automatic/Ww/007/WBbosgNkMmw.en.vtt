00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.240
 good afternoon here comes my second in 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.790
 play of luck in served in Spanish and 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.920
 today we are going to take advantage of this great 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.130
 update that arrived this week a 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.860
 very heavy upgrade rebalanced 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.930
 of borregán characters of the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.109
 characters modifying island in the 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.769
 group expansion system rébak the 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.380
 best bad therapist belder daughter I think 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.289
 that if kissing he think that no no 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.550
 reached but if the notes regions that 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.350
 had not been modified before 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.420
 modified the table was modified 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.340
 experience so that now the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.870
 level with even less experience than 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.270
 before they get up faster experience 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.420
 also some missions were changed and there are 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.630
 one thing that affects many of them too 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.630
 is that they removed the title of butcher 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.600
 divine but good since we are on island 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.280
 inherit we will go to what governs us not 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.580
 I have no fucking idea of how 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.210
 how to train how it works inherits 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.540
 now 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.030
 once the first one enters to prove 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.830
 because it would be too heavy to enter the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.270
 first time here if I had idea 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 basically why 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's not because I did not want to do the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.479
 first because it looks bad but because 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.369
 I go with a team and I do not want to harm 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 to my colleagues then the first time 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.189
 I wanted to look at myself and try to do it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.109
 the best possible because when I comment 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.000
 obviously of game also that without 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:38.280
 games without commenting because I'm not so 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.610
 focused on playing what it is to manage 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.310
 inheritance has basically had certain 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 modifications some modifications that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.400
 they do it much more interesting now by 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.659
 example now to be able to pass the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 wings have to reach the four 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.869
 comrades to teleportation if they are not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.210
 the four companions the teleportation 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.790
 no further progress is very important 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.920
 this because as some efe that stays 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.039
 back there because the team loses 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.590
 basically it's a bitch but it's what 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.920
 there is still fighting against enemies and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.630
 towers but there is one thing that has changed 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 quite important is that it no longer exceeds 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.840
 attack the characters of our 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.000
 rivals that is no part of pvp now 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.269
 in herrera inherits now is a test 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.120
 time trial of pv is not a mixture of 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.360
 pvp that for me was interesting before 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.400
 but good 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.070
 depends he did not have his good parts and his 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.290
 bad parts you 've seen 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.270
 nothing now you can choose the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.180
 enhancers that using the keyboard 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.100
 we can give it from 1 to 2 or 3 and choose 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.030
 the enhancer that most benefits 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.150
 our enhancer team that comes to us 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 very good 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.970
 another thing that is quite important is 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.640
 apart from that you can not attack the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.340
 rivals completely balanced what 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.750
 that I will make the power of all 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.739
 I explain myself 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.780
 basically what you want to say is that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.040
 accessory equipment 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.300
 avatars and all that is equalized and canceled 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.269
 your doubt in your values and how you 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.099
 I would say in our characters they go alone 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.569
 with its base power therefore it does not matter 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.220
 that you have the best equipment of the 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.500
 game like the worst we're going to be all 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.519
 equaled in inheritance is going to be a test 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 of pure skill also the 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.989
 skills the skills are at level 1 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.019
 that is, we are not going to have, because we are going to 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.060
 find with a hyper in plus 4 by 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.209
 example not so let's all be in 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.800
 all is 15 level 1 that means that 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.750
 the thing is much equal 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.510
 also 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.240
 the things that 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.470
 they are manufactured that are obtained in inheritance 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.370
 the missions have also changed 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.930
 daily from here therefore I think it 's 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.480
 a pretty concrete rebalance and I think 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.450
 that helps a lot to inherit something very very 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.459
 important and that was very necessary 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.720
 because it inherits as I said in the last 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.260
 video that I made 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.690
 I did not so much doing so much 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.210
 that I did I went to inherit with 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.060
 subscribers and good was it was pretty 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.030
 okay the thing 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.000
 but of course it was deserted and I 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.669
 I think this is good for you 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.250
 a little push to this game mode that 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.910
 the truth is that it is a true 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.300
 pity that it is so so so abandoned 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.000
 Really 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.110
 but well we have finished not even 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.669
 won go won them 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.919
 what a pity but good the truth is that 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.590
 this of a video so explanatory more than 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.720
 a gameplay showing anything that 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.870
 and more than since those that you could 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.110
 enter to inherit even then check it and 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.990
 I told you about the basic changes that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.120
 has suffered in age I have not played well what 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.710
 I know that he has not played well at all but 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.900
 good is what I mentioned before 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.449
 was while I comment all this and 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.460
 I'm already telling you I only have targeted 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.930
 here a chop the most points 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.400
 important but the truth is that it is 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.169
 reciting from memory because they are watching 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.599
 the screen but good I hope that you 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.729
 this video has been useful and we 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.690
 we see in future gameplays so nothing 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.690
 to other classmates
