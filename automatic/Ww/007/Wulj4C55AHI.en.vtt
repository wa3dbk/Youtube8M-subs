00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
I bought it to check it out but I

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.629 
I bought it to check it out but I
probably<00:01:40.210> won't<00:01:40.479> use<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.929> all<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.079> much<00:01:41.639> even

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:42.639

probably won't use it all that much even
though<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.270> good<00:01:43.600> style<00:01:43.899> at<00:01:44.049> knife<00:01:44.259> and

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you know there's no question that it can

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.740 
you know there's no question that it can
be<00:03:23.459> useful<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:25.770> way<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:25.980> was<00:03:26.370> taught<00:03:26.750> is

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
be useful but the way I was taught is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.729 
be useful but the way I was taught is
that<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.670> get<00:03:29.850> your<00:03:29.910> tinder<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:31.410> get<00:03:31.590> that

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
that you get your tinder you get that

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.770 
that you get your tinder you get that
all<00:03:31.890> prepared<00:03:32.310> then<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:32.940> twigs<00:03:33.360> and

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
all prepared then you have twigs and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.630 
all prepared then you have twigs and
prying<00:03:34.620> snaps<00:03:36.440> that's<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:38.040> diameter<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.520> a

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
prying snaps that's the diameter of a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.030 
prying snaps that's the diameter of a
pencil<00:03:38.820> then<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.900> gather<00:03:40.050> stuff<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:40.860> big

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
pencil then you gather stuff it's as big

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.449 
pencil then you gather stuff it's as big
as<00:03:41.100> your<00:03:41.340> fingers<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:43.440> your<00:03:43.739> wrist<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.370> then

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
as your fingers and your wrist and then

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.210 
as your fingers and your wrist and then
your<00:03:44.610> leg<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.650> you

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
your leg and if you do that you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.640 
your leg and if you do that you
shouldn't<00:03:47.550> have<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.760> baton<00:03:48.180> wood<00:03:48.510> now<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.290> guess

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
shouldn't have to baton wood now I guess

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.280 
shouldn't have to baton wood now I guess
where<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> could<00:03:50.489> see<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:51.000> being<00:03:51.269> valuable<00:03:51.870> is

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
where I could see this being valuable is

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.229 
where I could see this being valuable is
in<00:03:52.560> an<00:03:52.680> area<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.070> wasn't<00:03:53.430> plentiful<00:03:54.090> with

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
in an area that wasn't plentiful with

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.720 
in an area that wasn't plentiful with
wood<00:03:54.590> where<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.709> might<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.810> be<00:03:57.989> fighting

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
wood where you might just be fighting

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.860 
wood where you might just be fighting
some<00:03:59.730> driftwood<00:04:00.330> or<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:02.760> know<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.180> really

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
some driftwood or you know I really

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.120 
some driftwood or you know I really
don't<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.200> areas<00:04:04.620> where<00:04:04.769> there's<00:04:04.980> not<00:04:05.070> a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
don't go to areas where there's not a

and<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:32.250> will<00:04:32.640> do<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.790> great<00:04:33.060> job<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.510> it

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
and this will do a great job of it

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.390 
and this will do a great job of it
I<00:04:34.850> guess<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.060> timing<00:04:36.450> could<00:04:36.630> be<00:04:36.750> useful<00:04:37.400> to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
I guess the timing could be useful to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.370 
I guess the timing could be useful to
get<00:04:38.610> at<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.910> dry<00:04:39.180> stuff<00:04:39.510> in<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.810> center<00:04:40.140> this

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
get at the dry stuff in the center this

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.440 
get at the dry stuff in the center this
this<00:04:40.710> outer<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.310> all<00:04:41.550> wet<00:04:41.820> from<00:04:42.060> being<00:04:42.240> in<00:04:42.360> the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
this outer is all wet from being in the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.390 
this outer is all wet from being in the
snow<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.840> this<00:04:45.840> knife<00:04:46.110> will<00:04:46.350> do<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.950> job<00:04:46.980> and

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
snow so this knife will do the job and

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.590 
snow so this knife will do the job and
there's<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.580> lot<00:04:47.730> of<00:04:47.850> knives<00:04:48.030> out<00:04:48.240> there<00:04:48.450> that

bought this woman spent the extra cash

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:11.780 
bought this woman spent the extra cash
is<00:06:03.330> because<00:06:04.200> I<00:06:06.290> steal<00:06:09.050> junk<00:06:10.160> but<00:06:11.160> this<00:06:11.370> has<00:06:11.640> an

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
is because I steal junk but this has an

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.070 
is because I steal junk but this has an
s30v<00:06:12.420> blade<00:06:12.930> which<00:06:13.410> is<00:06:14.300> very<00:06:15.300> good<00:06:15.570> quality

the<00:06:18.570> only<00:06:18.750> downside<00:06:19.260> is<00:06:19.560> that<00:06:20.040> it<00:06:20.670> can<00:06:20.880> be<00:06:21.020> much

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
the only downside is that it can be much

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.600 
the only downside is that it can be much
harder<00:06:22.230> to<00:06:22.320> sharpen<00:06:22.770> than<00:06:22.920> others<00:06:23.160> but<00:06:23.400> once

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
harder to sharpen than others but once

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.980 
harder to sharpen than others but once
you<00:06:23.700> put<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.090> edge<00:06:24.240> on<00:06:24.450> there<00:06:24.690> if<00:06:24.810> you<00:06:24.900> know

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
you put the edge on there if you know

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.570 
you put the edge on there if you know
what<00:06:25.080> you're<00:06:25.230> doing<00:06:25.470> it'll<00:06:26.070> hold<00:06:26.160> it<00:06:26.340> for<00:06:26.490> an

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
what you're doing it'll hold it for an

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.320 
what you're doing it'll hold it for an
