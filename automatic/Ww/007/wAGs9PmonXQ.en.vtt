00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
tending it quite a lot nor have I been

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
tending it quite a lot nor have I been
tending<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.210> other<00:00:33.329> plants<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> lot<00:00:34.290> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
tending my other plants you see a lot of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720 
tending my other plants you see a lot of
them<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.620> sort<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:34.950> cacti<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
them are sort of like cacti and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.200 
them are sort of like cacti and
succulents<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> aloe<00:00:38.820> vera

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
succulents so you have the aloe vera

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
succulents so you have the aloe vera
there<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.600> think<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.399> Chia<00:00:41.399> plant

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
there and I think this is a Chia plant

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.979 
there and I think this is a Chia plant
from<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> chia<00:00:42.210> seeds<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.660> used<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
from the chia seeds they used to have a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
from the chia seeds they used to have a
chia<00:00:43.230> pet<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.399> extra<00:00:44.730> seeds<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.210> just

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
chia pet and I had extra seeds so I just

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.029 
chia pet and I had extra seeds so I just
sort<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.629> planted<00:00:45.960> them<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.710> sort<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
sort of planted them I know it's sort of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.450 
sort of planted them I know it's sort of
in<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.910> organic<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.710> it's<00:00:49.710> part

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
in there it's not organic but it's part

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of screwing up but one of the listeners

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.600 
of screwing up but one of the listeners
and<00:01:16.500> viewers<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:18.240> videos<00:01:18.570> told<00:01:18.990> me<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
and viewers of my videos told me that

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
and viewers of my videos told me that
she<00:01:20.610> read<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.180> shouldn't<00:01:21.689> over<00:01:21.930> water

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
she read that you shouldn't over water

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.070 
she read that you shouldn't over water
them<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.759> I<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:24.299> haven't<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
them and I really haven't I think it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
them and I really haven't I think it
rained<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.710> lot<00:01:25.860> lately<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.490> usually<00:01:27.030> it's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
rained a lot lately but usually it's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.270 
rained a lot lately but usually it's
been<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> dry<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.920> they've<00:01:29.130> been

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
been kind of dry and so they've been

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.859 
been kind of dry and so they've been
having<00:01:29.430> sort<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.020> very<00:01:31.020> hot<00:01:31.259> conditions<00:01:31.549> dry

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
having sort of very hot conditions dry

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.380 
having sort of very hot conditions dry
very<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.710> sunny<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.119> they've<00:01:36.240> been

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
very very sunny so I think they've been

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.929 
very very sunny so I think they've been
responding<00:01:36.900> well<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:38.540> believe<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
responding well to that I believe in the

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
responding well to that I believe in the
idea<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.320> early<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.740> should<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.100> have

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
idea that early on they should not have

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.429 
idea that early on they should not have
too<00:01:44.610> much<00:01:44.759> Sun<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.259> what

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
too much Sun because I think that's what

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.899 
too much Sun because I think that's what
killed<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> other<00:01:47.250> ones<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> just

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
killed some of the other ones that just

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.929 
killed some of the other ones that just
sort<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> died<00:01:49.159> later<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
sort of died later on when they get a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
sort of died later on when they get a
really<00:01:51.240> good<00:01:51.270> route<00:01:51.750> hold<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.220> get

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
really good route hold you know they get

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069 
really good route hold you know they get
a<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.729> good<00:01:53.759> root<00:01:54.119> system<00:01:54.149> grown<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.049> i

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
a really good root system grown there i

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.370 
a really good root system grown there i
think<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.860> Sun<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.430> beneficial

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
think that the Sun is very beneficial

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.280 
think that the Sun is very beneficial
you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.790> but<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:01.049> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you know but I think that you know at in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.539 
you know but I think that you know at in
the<00:02:01.409> end<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> day<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.189> you're<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the end of the day if you're going to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490 
the end of the day if you're going to
just<00:02:02.670> take<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.060> dried<00:02:03.299> goji<00:02:03.540> berries<00:02:03.930> dried

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
just take like dried goji berries dried

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709 
just take like dried goji berries dried
goji<00:02:04.799> berries<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.490> plant<00:02:05.880> them<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.689> should

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
goji berries and plant them you should

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
goji berries and plant them you should
plant<00:02:07.079> them<00:02:07.229> quite<00:02:07.500> deep<00:02:07.740> it'll<00:02:07.950> take<00:02:08.280> longer

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
plant them quite deep it'll take longer

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.660 
plant them quite deep it'll take longer
for<00:02:08.700> them<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> sprout<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> think

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
for them to sprout but then I think

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
for them to sprout but then I think
it'll<00:02:11.819> probably<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.180> better<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.599> three

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it'll probably be better like three

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.850 
it'll probably be better like three
inches<00:02:13.740> deep<00:02:13.980> i'd<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.520> maybe<00:02:14.970> for<00:02:15.740> three<00:02:16.740> and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
inches deep i'd say maybe for three and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.220 
inches deep i'd say maybe for three and
a<00:02:16.890> half<00:02:16.950> probably<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:18.360> i<00:02:18.390> did<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.810> i<00:02:18.900> pointed

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
a half probably what i did is i pointed

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.260 
a half probably what i did is i pointed
them<00:02:19.320> about<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.740> inches<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.250> then<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.670> lot<00:02:21.120> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
them about two inches and then a lot of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.050 
them about two inches and then a lot of
them<00:02:21.360> died<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:22.620> some<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.160> them<00:02:23.220> i<00:02:23.340> reap<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.970> took

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
them died but some of them i reap I took

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.720 
them died but some of them i reap I took
the<00:02:24.480> actual<00:02:24.780> plant<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.230> buried<00:02:25.620> them<00:02:25.950> like

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the actual plant and I buried them like

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.430 
the actual plant and I buried them like
an<00:02:26.850> inch<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.150> under<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.600> soil<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> they

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
an inch or so under the soil and they

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.670 
an inch or so under the soil and they
they<00:02:29.430> took<00:02:29.730> them<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.810> maybe<00:02:30.960> two<00:02:31.050> inches<00:02:31.320> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
they took them one maybe two inches and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.080 
they took them one maybe two inches and
it<00:02:31.770> took<00:02:31.920> them<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.130> while<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.550> they<00:02:32.670> came<00:02:32.850> back

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
it took them a while but they came back

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.880 
it took them a while but they came back
and<00:02:34.100> here<00:02:35.100> are<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.250> surviving<00:02:35.730> ones<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:37.560> one

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
leaves and that the leaves are really

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.070
