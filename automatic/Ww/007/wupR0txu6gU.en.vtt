 Do you know what to build in the seventh iphone 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.949
 info of course not a hundred percent but inside 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.900
 new apple smartphone with enough 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.300
 high degree of probability may 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.730
 appear 3d scanner and if not having time 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.339
 seven what does it mean to be in iphone 8 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.380
 why are you so sure about this and besides 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.210
 growing interest in 3d printing which is like 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.749
 famous goes hand in hand with 3d 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.339
 scan there are other evidence 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.360
 for example, have you heard about such a company 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.700
 like prime sens 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.770
 it was her experts who developed 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.840
 its time 3d sensor for kinect 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.610
 now guess who bought the price and in 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 end of 2013 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.470
 however that we are all about apple do a bible 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 they haven't even bothered 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.280
 build your devices 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.170
 here and companies like ax 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.840
 fed to do everything for spilled 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.690
 Cupertino resident village let 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 extract sensor and looks like 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.450
 hi-tech growth on the back 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.220
 ipad but this device 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.480
 really works and today we are you 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.480
 show it in action 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.340
 according to an ancient legend at the end of 2011 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.409
 the ax employees were friendly 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 make kinect mobile than us 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.659
 engaged then for a year and a half 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.759
 autumn 2013 the company has planned 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.790
 raise money for a sensor line project with 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.479
 using kickstarter and hit the jackpot in 1 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.950
 million and nearly 300 thousand us dollars 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.869
 first park of devices sent back in 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.390
 the beginning of 2014 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.640
 and now thanks to the company matt robot 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:45.460
 This sensor can be bought in the open spaces 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:47.590
 immensely inside the sensor line 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.899
 infrared laser paint everything around 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.450
 pattern of invisible points infrared 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.920
 infrared light sensor and quite 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.800
 ordinary device battery 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.960
 autonomous works from one charge 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.080
 three to four hours and thousands of hours can 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.640
 stand by 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.679
 censor itself is screwed by 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.530
 four slat screws which then 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.600
 clings to ipad after this scanners 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.480
 tablet connect through a special 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.980
 cable by the way today oxide 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.440
 it officially supports ipads 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.269
 fourth generation ipad air and ipad 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.610
 mini with retina display 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.519
 for each of them has its own fixing 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.980
 plank run all apple gadgets 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.540
 having lightning connector and here 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.299
 android users ask not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.829
 worry joke ax fueled promotes 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.450
 idea with open source new drivers 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.220
 distributes development package 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.320
 software supports 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 open to specification and separately 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.280
 sells hacker cable in other words 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.810
 strongly support enthusiasts 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.840
 able to create their own unique 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.010
 applications on other platforms 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 go to the fun on 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.970
 Today webstore can be found several 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.890
 free applications developed 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 walls ax fueled as well as one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.670
 really cool program from 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.810
 Russian yes yes you heard right 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.690
 companies and birds start with the simplest all 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.470
 taxi applications fed anyway 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.989
 intended for demonstration 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.329
 capabilities of their scanner for example 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.069
 main application scribbling creates 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.730
 visualization in 3 modes infrared 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.540
 with the display of the depth of the scene and 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.700
 combined when the image 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.680
 obtained with the camera up to combines 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.409
 artificial coloring addictions 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.670
 from distance to objects there is an option 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.519
 showing gaming potential 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.439
 gadget running the application features can 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.889
 drive the cat's board of the staza yellow 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.719
 by sword 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.879
 First you need to encode 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.579
 space around the real world will be 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.319
 part of the virtual gaming scene code 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.799
 can move within specified limits 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.930
 skirting obstacles app scanner 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.430
 helps from encode the object and then 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:56.519
 view it in different modes 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:58.680
 or send a 3d file by mail room captcha 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.349
 same as scanner but optimized 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.569
 for scanning the premises of the program 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.069
 viewer calibrators are auxiliary ones 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.889
 utilities that can be used without a hitch 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.780
 conscience to skip and go to the promised 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.480
 the program from the Nizhny Novgorod company 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.090
 gypsies for a start we had to show 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.820
 savvy mounting plate in test 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.159
 Sample fit only for ipad mini 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.220
 and his silenok not enough to work with 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:25.349
 exec 3d general adhesive tape masking tape 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.289
 two-way coupe with ipad air 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:31.349
 made a miracle the application can work 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.110
 in two modes, scanning objects or 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.570
 man on the one hand everything is simple with 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.120
 another without certain skills may 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.190
 get something like this but already 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.729
 after an hour of training, everything looked 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.620
 much better scan the person and 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.320
 this 3d do what videographers do 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.729
 called the milk plan is somewhat simpler 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.949
 for example, there is no need to invest 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.080
 the object is something of a magazine or newspaper 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.270
 it is enough that the program recognized the face 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.889
 shootable and then catch it in green 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.509
 frame 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.969
 do a dozen shots around not 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.460
 forget to remove the crown then the resulting 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.130
 3d model you need to give the answer on the servers 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.680
 companies and then you can brag to 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.710
 friends scrolling through the resulting object 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.509
 on the screen of a tablet or laptop or 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.509
 print yourself a loved one on a 3d printer 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.810
 let's be honest for ordinary users 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.910
 this toy is for two days, but if you 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.250
 developer who believes the triumph of technology 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.470
 if u have any trendsetter or 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.660
 sorry god or adapter well or even 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.460
 I would buy 3d printer at a low price then 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.500
 string sensor must necessarily 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.270
 fill up your gadget arsenal as not 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.070
 cool but this device despite 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.810
 a lot of glitches and not big 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.520
 the range of applications is excellent 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.930
 demonstrates what can become 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.130
 real tomorrow and it's worth it
