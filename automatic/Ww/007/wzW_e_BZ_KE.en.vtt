that I might have pulled it out wrong

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.760 
that I might have pulled it out wrong
this<00:03:08.070> one<00:03:08.280> has<00:03:08.400> really<00:03:08.430> got<00:03:08.850> some<00:03:08.880> wired<00:03:09.770> and

this one has really got some wired and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.500 
this one has really got some wired and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
so my hair is still in it

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.790 
so my hair is still in it
so<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.900> means<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.260> pulled<00:03:13.440> my<00:03:13.620> hair<00:03:13.770> out

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.610 
out tonight I might come back and show
you<00:03:21.000> how<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.420> looks<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.900> found<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.500> go

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
you how it looks and I found it to go

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.310 
you how it looks and I found it to go
well<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.150> think<00:03:24.210> it<00:03:24.450> might<00:03:24.570> last<00:03:24.780> longer<00:03:24.960> if

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
well but I think it might last longer if

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.100 
well but I think it might last longer if
I<00:03:25.410> don't<00:03:25.590> separate<00:03:25.950> them<00:03:26.160> right<00:03:26.370> away<00:03:27.050> this<00:03:28.050> is

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
I don't separate them right away this is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.600 
I don't separate them right away this is
what<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.590> from<00:03:28.770> conformist

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
what I got from conformist

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:39.190 
what I got from conformist
I<00:03:29.640> like<00:03:30.270> it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:48.280

first<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.970> rep<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.510> Rome<00:03:52.610> in<00:03:53.610> orange<00:03:54.270> and

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
first the rep in Rome in orange and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.290 
first the rep in Rome in orange and
yellow<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:56.100> orange<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.610> pink<00:03:56.790> long<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.630> wide

yellow the orange and pink long and wide

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:09.290 
yellow the orange and pink long and wide
that's<00:04:03.170> $9<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.400> think<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.849> even<00:04:09.030> though

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
that's $9 so I think that even though

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.900 
that's $9 so I think that even though
the<00:04:09.630> curlformers<00:04:10.290> are<00:04:10.440> expensive<00:04:11.010> it's

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
the curlformers are expensive it's

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.699 
the curlformers are expensive it's
probably<00:04:12.390> worth<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.080> can<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.500> kind

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
probably worth it if I can get this kind

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.400 
probably worth it if I can get this kind
