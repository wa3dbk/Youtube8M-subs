shouts I was just watching the replay in
and<00:01:01.510> it's<00:01:02.110> kind<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.379> it's<00:01:02.590> kind<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.829> funny

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.499

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
practice shots like that and they're

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.969 
practice shots like that and they're
like<00:01:43.360> he's<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.810> full<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.229> gritty<00:01:44.470> war<00:01:44.709> you

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
like he's so full of a gritty war you

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.669 
like he's so full of a gritty war you
know<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.420> actually<00:01:47.110> that's<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
know and but actually that's one of the

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.100 
know and but actually that's one of the
reason<00:01:47.950> why<00:01:48.039> I<00:01:48.069> do<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.720> know<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:50.020> a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
reason why I do it because I know of a

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.990 
reason why I do it because I know of a
kitchen<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.679> match<00:01:50.830> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.819> have

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
kitchen and match you can have

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.090 
kitchen and match you can have
situations<00:01:52.209> like<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.170> today<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:53.950> was

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
situations like that and today I was

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.460 
situations like that and today I was
just<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:55.420> yes<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:55.720> powerful<00:01:56.140> player<00:01:56.380> you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
just like yes the powerful player you

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.469 
just like yes the powerful player you
know<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.709> ball<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:56.979> not<00:01:57.130> gonna<00:01:57.280> bounce<00:01:58.060> before

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
know the ball is not gonna bounce before

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:06.219 
know the ball is not gonna bounce before
the<00:01:58.630> service<00:01:58.990> line<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.580> improvise

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.570 

well<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.530> think<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> had<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.220> bad<00:02:08.340> start

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
well I think I had a really bad start

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.130 
well I think I had a really bad start
again<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> second<00:02:09.420> set<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.630> was<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
again in the second set I was down a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.840 
again in the second set I was down a
breakpoint<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.069> he<00:02:11.220> was<00:02:11.370> he<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.819> just

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
breakpoint and he was he was just

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.180 
breakpoint and he was he was just
putting<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.690> much<00:02:12.870> pressure<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.410> each<00:02:13.860> point

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
putting so much pressure on each point

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.460 
putting so much pressure on each point
so<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.670> was<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.360> thinking<00:02:15.510> eventually<00:02:15.990> that

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
so I was just thinking eventually that

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.680 
so I was just thinking eventually that
he<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:16.890> sort<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.340> slow<00:02:17.700> down<00:02:17.940> or<00:02:18.209> snap<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.660> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
he would sort of slow down or snap on a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.330 
he would sort of slow down or snap on a
few<00:02:18.900> shots<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.380> he<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.680> raising<00:02:20.069> his

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
few shots but he was just raising his

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.640 
few shots but he was just raising his
level<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.630> think<00:02:21.810> when<00:02:21.930> those<00:02:22.110> shots<00:02:22.380> came

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
level and I think when those shots came

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.920 
level and I think when those shots came
at<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.340> don't<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.209> if<00:02:24.360> he<00:02:24.540> started

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
at the I don't know if he started

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260 
at the I don't know if he started
thinking<00:02:25.260> about<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.130> shots<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.209> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
thinking about the shots or the way I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.199 
thinking about the shots or the way I
did<00:02:27.569> them<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.180> his

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
did them or just or it was just in his

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.000 
did them or just or it was just in his
head<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:30.870> bit<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.020> mean<00:02:31.230> he<00:02:31.319> came<00:02:31.560> over<00:02:31.770> if

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
head a little bit I mean he came over if

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.050 
head a little bit I mean he came over if
he<00:02:32.130> spawned<00:02:32.430> me<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.050> it's<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:35.060> it's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
he spawned me so it's you know it's it's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.910 
he spawned me so it's you know it's it's
it's<00:02:36.390> never<00:02:36.660> easy<00:02:36.900> when<00:02:37.020> when<00:02:37.440> something<00:02:37.800> like

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it's never easy when when something like

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.180 
it's never easy when when something like
that<00:02:37.980> happens<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.580> course<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:41.100> be

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
that happens of course but I to be

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.080 
that happens of course but I to be
honest<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> don't<00:02:41.519> know<00:02:41.670> what's<00:02:41.850> going<00:02:42.060> through

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
honest I don't know what's going through

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.370 
honest I don't know what's going through
his<00:02:42.269> head<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.750> moment<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:45.110> don't<00:02:46.110> think

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
his head in that moment I don't think

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.800 
his head in that moment I don't think
it's<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:47.040> there's<00:02:47.280> no<00:02:47.489> pressure<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.570> think

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it's so now there's no pressure I think

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440 
it's so now there's no pressure I think
it's<00:02:48.989> out<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.250> picture<00:02:50.580> for<00:02:50.610> I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it's out of out of the picture for I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.960 
it's out of out of the picture for I
think<00:02:52.050> for<00:02:52.260> those<00:02:52.440> those<00:02:52.890> kind<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.250> generation

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
think for those those kind of generation

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.390 
think for those those kind of generation
you<00:02:54.030> know<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.300> 1991-92<00:02:55.260> whatever<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.250> know<00:02:56.370> I

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.819 
layers meaning I mean I'm a top layer
I'm<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.000> saying<00:03:42.360> like<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.140> top

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
I'm just saying like the like the top

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.210 
I'm just saying like the like the top
four<00:03:44.100> guys<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:45.440> especially<00:03:46.440> against<00:03:46.769> Andy

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
four guys I especially against Andy

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.060 
four guys I especially against Andy
against<00:03:47.670> Novak<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.600> Rafa<00:03:49.170> munis<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.620> had<00:03:49.769> tough

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
against Novak and Rafa munis I had tough

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.449 
against Novak and Rafa munis I had tough
battles<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:50.730> then<00:03:50.850> in<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> same<00:03:51.209> time<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:52.620> had

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
battles but then in the same time I had

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.599 
battles but then in the same time I had
bad<00:03:53.700> losses<00:03:54.120> against<00:03:54.390> them<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:56.250> think

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
bad losses against them so it's I think

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.340 
bad losses against them so it's I think
sometimes<00:03:57.150> she<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.420> matters<00:03:58.019> how<00:03:58.049> you're

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
sometimes she just matters how you're

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770 
sometimes she just matters how you're
gonna<00:03:58.440> approach<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.130> hole<00:03:59.340> not<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.600> match

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
gonna approach the hole not that match

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.360 
gonna approach the hole not that match
in<00:04:00.930> particular<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.010> way<00:04:02.130> you're<00:04:02.280> gonna

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
in particular but the way you're gonna

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.979 
in particular but the way you're gonna
prepare<00:04:02.820> for<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.060> whole<00:04:03.209> term<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:03.660> itself

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
prepare for the whole term in itself

almost a tricky upon and we've played I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.020 
almost a tricky upon and we've played I
think<00:04:19.810> quite<00:04:20.169> of<00:04:20.350> quite<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.040> few<00:04:21.250> times<00:04:21.400> against

think quite of quite a few times against
each<00:04:22.150> other<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.870> think<00:04:23.590> there's<00:04:23.860> only<00:04:23.950> gonna<00:04:24.100> be

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
each other I think there's only gonna be

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.980 
each other I think there's only gonna be
many<00:04:24.490> secrets<00:04:24.910> for<00:04:25.060> us<00:04:25.150> on<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.389> court<00:04:25.660> whether

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
many secrets for us on the court whether

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.510 
many secrets for us on the court whether
it<00:04:26.200> has<00:04:26.320> been<00:04:26.530> what<00:04:26.980> is<00:04:27.100> going<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.280> be<00:04:27.400> the

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
it has been what is going to be the

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.790 
it has been what is going to be the
serving<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> shots<00:04:28.270> or<00:04:28.450> any<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.720> that<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.770> I

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
serving the shots or any of that so I

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.260 
serving the shots or any of that so I
think<00:04:29.919> it's<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.610> know<00:04:30.700> where<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:30.940> can<00:04:31.090> come

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
think it's you know where it can come

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.620 
think it's you know where it can come
down<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.690> few<00:04:31.870> points<00:04:32.020> here<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.470> there
