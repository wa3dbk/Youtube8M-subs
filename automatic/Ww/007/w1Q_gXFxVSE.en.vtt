comes back throughout the song and I'm
gonna<00:00:30.610> play<00:00:30.910> it<00:00:31.150> more<00:00:31.300> or<00:00:31.390> less<00:00:31.480> normal<00:00:32.050> speed

to<00:00:32.770> start<00:00:32.949> with<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:34.030> then<00:00:34.179> I'll<00:00:34.510> go<00:00:34.659> into<00:00:34.780> it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
to start with and then I'll go into it

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:54.440 
to start with and then I'll go into it
in<00:00:35.019> more<00:00:35.170> detail<00:00:35.589> and<00:00:35.829> slow<00:00:36.010> it<00:00:36.129> down<00:00:36.159> etc

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:09.790 

you

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.190 

okay<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:11.370> it<00:01:11.460> wasn't<00:01:11.610> perfect<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.060> um<00:01:12.300> Oh<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
okay so it wasn't perfect but um Oh as I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
okay so it wasn't perfect but um Oh as I
said<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.470> slowed<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.010> down<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.190> now<00:01:14.810> okay

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
said I've slowed it down a bit now okay

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
said I've slowed it down a bit now okay
so<00:01:16.040> would<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.280> look<00:01:17.370> at<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.550> left-hand<00:01:17.820> part

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so would just look at the left-hand part

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200 
so would just look at the left-hand part
which<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.510> actually<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.870> same<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.210> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
which is actually the same for the the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.720 
which is actually the same for the the
hook<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.110> solo<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.160> tackle<00:01:23.520> at

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
hook and the solo so we can tackle at

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.720 
hook and the solo so we can tackle at
all<00:01:24.480> at<00:01:24.630> once<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.370> here's<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.430> middle<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> the

little<00:02:23.420> bit<00:02:23.570> more<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.040> harmonic<00:02:25.040> padding<00:02:25.400> in

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
little bit more and harmonic padding in

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.770

the<00:02:25.580> middle<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.820> there<00:02:25.970> because<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.270> obviously

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the middle of there because I obviously

going<00:02:28.190> off<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.370> doing<00:02:28.520> entirely<00:02:29.390> melodic

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
going off and doing entirely melodic

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.870 
going off and doing entirely melodic
based<00:02:30.590> stuff<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.220> just<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.520> give<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.760> bit

based stuff so just to give it a bit

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720 
based stuff so just to give it a bit
more<00:02:31.910> texture<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> middle<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.550> that's<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
is a bit improvised so that means every

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.250 
is a bit improvised so that means every
time<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.340> play<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.760> would<00:02:52.940> probably<00:02:53.870> change

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
time I play it I would probably change

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.620 
time I play it I would probably change
things<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.830> slightly<00:02:55.120> same<00:02:56.120> as<00:02:56.240> Bruce

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
things just slightly same as Bruce

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.810 
things just slightly same as Bruce
Hornsby<00:02:56.960> himself<00:02:57.530> would<00:02:58.010> do<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:58.490> this<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
Hornsby himself would do but this is the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.080 
Hornsby himself would do but this is the
basic<00:02:59.260> pattern<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.650> follows<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.550> here<00:03:02.000> we<00:03:02.060> are

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
basic pattern it follows so here we are

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.670 
basic pattern it follows so here we are
again<00:03:02.240> middle<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.960> piano<00:03:03.110> middle<00:03:03.470> C's

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
again middle of the piano middle C's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.630 
again middle of the piano middle C's
here<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.990> I'll<00:03:06.620> try<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:06.980> play<00:03:07.130> pretty<00:03:07.310> slow

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
here and I'll try and play pretty slow

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.400 
here and I'll try and play pretty slow
for<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.390> timing<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.900> your<00:03:09.020> one<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.260> just

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
for the timing of it your one and just

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.440 
for the timing of it your one and just
listen<00:03:09.710> again<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.130> song<00:03:10.430> or<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.880> the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
listen again to the song or to the the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.200 
listen again to the song or to the the
intro<00:03:11.660> when<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.840> played<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.340> earlier<00:03:13.340> okay<00:03:14.150> so

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
intro when I played it earlier okay so

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.570 
intro when I played it earlier okay so
there<00:03:15.080> little<00:03:15.290> lead-in<00:03:15.680> after<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.130> intro<00:03:16.400> bit

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
there little lead-in after the intro bit

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.240 
there little lead-in after the intro bit
we<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.730> go<00:03:20.320> okay<00:03:21.350> that's<00:03:21.860> just<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> right

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
we just go okay that's just the right

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.770 
we just go okay that's just the right
hand<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.460> its<00:03:22.580> own<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.300> following<00:03:23.600> that

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
hand on its own and then following that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.240 
hand on its own and then following that
the<00:03:23.900> left<00:03:24.080> hand<00:03:24.290> would<00:03:24.380> come<00:03:24.620> in<00:03:24.740> as<00:03:24.920> you<00:03:25.100> saw

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
the left hand would come in as you saw

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.420 
the left hand would come in as you saw
me<00:03:25.400> playing<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.060> second<00:03:26.420> ago<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.890> then<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.310> get

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
me playing a second ago and then we get

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:53.809 
me playing a second ago and then we get
this<00:03:34.720> so-called<00:03:35.720> E

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:11.690 

okay<00:03:57.810> get<00:03:58.810> up

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.760 

okay<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.090> then<00:04:13.480> that's<00:04:13.570> that's<00:04:14.140> half<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.560> it

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
okay and then that's that's half of it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:30.960 
okay and then that's that's half of it
and<00:04:15.130> second<00:04:15.490> half<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:17.440> do<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:24.420> again<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:30.430> that

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
and second half we do this again so that

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.580 
and second half we do this again so that
was<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.270> was<00:04:31.390> quite<00:04:31.510> fun<00:04:31.870> actually

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
was that was quite fun actually

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:58.540 
was that was quite fun actually
so<00:04:32.920> D<00:04:33.160> Corrigan<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:38.790> then

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:18.250 

last<00:04:59.550> part

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.750 

Campbell<00:05:19.260> try<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.620> play<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.770> all<00:05:20.040> again<00:05:20.430> maybe

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
Campbell try and play it all again maybe

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.920 
Campbell try and play it all again maybe
try<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.060> play<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.180> slightly<00:05:21.600> quicker<00:05:21.720> this

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
try and play it slightly quicker this

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.690 
try and play it slightly quicker this
time<00:05:21.990> but<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.860> can<00:05:22.980> see<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.220> time<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.610> it

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
time but so you can see the time of it

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:50.350 
time but so you can see the time of it
better

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:06:03.050 

you

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
okay all right now okay so next we look

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.390 
okay all right now okay so next we look
at<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.449> solo<00:06:08.259> then<00:06:08.439> and<00:06:08.680> we've<00:06:09.129> talked<00:06:09.340> about

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
at the solo then and we've talked about

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.429 
at the solo then and we've talked about
the<00:06:09.550> left<00:06:09.699> hand<00:06:09.909> part<00:06:10.120> ready<00:06:10.330> it's<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.259> same

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
the left hand part ready it's the same

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:13.050 
the left hand part ready it's the same
as<00:06:11.560> it<00:06:11.650> was<00:06:11.770> for<00:06:11.949> the<00:06:12.039> last<00:06:12.370> section<00:06:12.759> okay

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
as it was for the last section okay

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.850 
as it was for the last section okay
which<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:13.870> some<00:06:13.990> slight<00:06:14.139> variations<00:06:14.590> so<00:06:14.740> we're

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
which is some slight variations so we're

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.589 
which is some slight variations so we're
gonna<00:06:14.949> focus<00:06:15.159> primarily<00:06:15.789> on<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.210> right<00:06:16.360> hand

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
gonna focus primarily on the right hand

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.990 
gonna focus primarily on the right hand
throughout<00:06:17.080> this<00:06:17.259> this<00:06:17.530> section<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.099> first

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
throughout this this section and first

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.390 
throughout this this section and first
off<00:06:19.180> I'll<00:06:20.080> play<00:06:20.650> it<00:06:20.710> for<00:06:20.889> you<00:06:20.949> more<00:06:21.189> or<00:06:21.280> less

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
off I'll play it for you more or less

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.770 
off I'll play it for you more or less
full<00:06:21.819> speed<00:06:22.060> memory<00:06:22.210> just<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.449> little<00:06:22.659> bit

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
full speed memory just a little bit

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.050 
full speed memory just a little bit
slower<00:06:23.409> and<00:06:23.710> is<00:06:24.520> the<00:06:24.610> most<00:06:24.759> technically

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
slower and is the most technically

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.089 
slower and is the most technically
challenging<00:06:25.449> part<00:06:25.659> of<00:06:25.719> the<00:06:25.810> song<00:06:26.020> and<00:06:26.919> you

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
challenging part of the song and you

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.469 
challenging part of the song and you
just<00:06:27.250> gotta<00:06:27.430> listen<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:27.699> it<00:06:27.939> for<00:06:28.060> timing

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
just gotta listen to it for timing

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.749 
just gotta listen to it for timing
really<00:06:29.080> but<00:06:29.800> here<00:06:30.039> it<00:06:30.129> is<00:06:30.189> more<00:06:30.250> less<00:06:30.520> full

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
really but here it is more less full

00:06:30.759 --> 00:07:15.089 
really but here it is more less full
speed

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.789 

okay<00:07:16.099> let's<00:07:16.249> slow<00:07:16.429> down<00:07:16.639> now
