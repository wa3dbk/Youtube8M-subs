00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 gamble online with other players 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 It's time to get on your nerves 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.849
 For example, by checking 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.070
 over strange figures takes over in the game 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.090
 gta 5 will even become characters 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.800
 raped 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.690
 what that explains is moors the online 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.039
 gamblers are connected via headset and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.250
 can not believe what is happening right now 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.250
 happens 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 I've been attacked many times 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.510
 the player has been harassed 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.510
 but that is really unfair 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.500
 then the field leaves the whole scene 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.510
 I still explode with all violence 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.520
 and all sex at gta for years 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 this includes that they are the themselves 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.890
 make-up in the online mode not thought up 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.920
 to have 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 that was a hacker or mother your sex 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.140
 scenes from the game just click this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 situation in the online match has transferred 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 in fact it is not so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 just in a game simply a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.329
 to hack and do that in his favor 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 change 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.199
 that's pretty hard to do 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 you look very good with programming with 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.920
 the silly know the col 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.869
 Rape scene is a new one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 Tasteless highlight of an online 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
 culture that is spreading more and more 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 just the other people the game 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 mess up 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.229
 the online mode makes it possible 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.540
 at gta, too, playing with construction like 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
 minecraft suddenly someone appears 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.229
 the one supplied the score in the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.390
 he breaks everything down for hours 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 has tinkered alone or here sand 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.070
 If I just built everything here 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.479
 broken what drives such people is on 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.710
 of course hard to say but I would 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.570
 think publicity now 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 because now, of course, about this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.130
 Report case and you build yourself like that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 a kind of reputation on man becomes known and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.159
 that's just what he is in the hacker 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 not scene for one or the other 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.600
 very uninteresting who times for briefing 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.460
 victim can hardly do anything except 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 to let the game manufacturer know 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.270
 one is sure of hackers too 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.270
 when gambling only in offline mode
