00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
teach you how to get salty flavor out of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.070 
teach you how to get salty flavor out of
your<00:00:10.889> dip<00:00:11.219> there<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> couple<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.630> ways<00:00:12.840> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
your dip there are a couple of ways of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.740 
your dip there are a couple of ways of
doing<00:00:13.349> this<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.799> first<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:15.540> can

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
doing this the first one is you can

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.439 
doing this the first one is you can
actually<00:00:16.070> make<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.250> double<00:00:17.550> batch<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:18.090> your<00:00:18.240> dip

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
actually make a double batch of your dip

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.450 
actually make a double batch of your dip
so<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:18.900> you've<00:00:19.050> made<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.380> dip<00:00:19.680> too<00:00:20.189> salty

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
so if you've made your dip too salty

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.330 
so if you've made your dip too salty
make<00:00:21.180> another<00:00:21.480> batch<00:00:21.689> without<00:00:22.170> salt<00:00:22.500> combine

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
make another batch without salt combine

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.490 
make another batch without salt combine
the<00:00:23.519> two<00:00:23.699> you'll<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.689> excess<00:00:25.050> amount<00:00:25.080> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the two you'll have an excess amount of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.160 
the two you'll have an excess amount of
dip<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.400> you'll<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.180> totally<00:00:27.599> corrected<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
dip but you'll have totally corrected it

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.349 
dip but you'll have totally corrected it
another<00:00:28.680> methods<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.760> serve<00:00:30.179> your

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
another methods you can do is serve your

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.510 
another methods you can do is serve your
dip<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.750> unsalted<00:00:31.230> crackers<00:00:31.529> or<00:00:32.009> crisps<00:00:32.399> or

dip with unsalted crackers or crisps or
bread<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.540> way<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.230> dipping<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.739> in

and<00:00:35.190> taste<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.600> won't<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.890> salty

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and taste it it won't have that as salty

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.010 
and taste it it won't have that as salty
taste<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> would<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.510> had<00:00:39.629> assaulted

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
taste as you would if you had assaulted

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.889 
taste as you would if you had assaulted
crack<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.559> chip<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> other<00:00:42.540> way

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
crack or chip and then the other way

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
crack or chip and then the other way
that<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.489> few<00:00:44.670> key

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that you can do that is using a few key

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
that you can do that is using a few key
ingredients<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.899> help<00:00:46.160> counteract<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
ingredients to help counteract that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
ingredients to help counteract that
salty<00:00:48.090> taste<00:00:48.590> first<00:00:49.590> thing<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.070> would<00:00:50.750> attempt

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
salty taste first thing I would attempt

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.549 
salty taste first thing I would attempt
is<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.800> appropriate<00:00:53.610> add<00:00:54.079> mayonnaise<00:00:55.079> or

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
is if it's appropriate add mayonnaise or

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.209 
is if it's appropriate add mayonnaise or
yogurt<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.640> sour<00:00:56.850> cream<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.750> dip<00:00:58.219> it'll

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
yogurt or sour cream to your dip it'll

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.160 
yogurt or sour cream to your dip it'll
stretch<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.820> without<00:01:00.120> losing<00:01:00.690> its<00:01:00.840> flavor

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
stretch it out without losing its flavor

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670 
stretch it out without losing its flavor
and<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.949> also<00:01:02.129> will<00:01:02.640> counteract<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.320> flavor

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and it also will counteract the flavor

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
and it also will counteract the flavor
of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> saltiness<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> has<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.150> little

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
of the saltiness because it has a little

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
of the saltiness because it has a little
bit<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> acidity<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:08.670> three<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> these

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
bit of acidity in all three of these

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.710 
bit of acidity in all three of these
items<00:01:10.640> another<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> counteract<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
items another way to counteract the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
items another way to counteract the
saltiness<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.710> whisk<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.610> bit<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
saltiness is to whisk in a little bit of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.600 
saltiness is to whisk in a little bit of
lemon<00:01:15.150> juice<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.570> red<00:01:15.990> wine<00:01:16.020> vinegar<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.860> hot

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
lemon juice or red wine vinegar or hot

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
lemon juice or red wine vinegar or hot
sauce<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.270> appropriate<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sauce if it's appropriate and then you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.969 
sauce if it's appropriate and then you
add<00:01:20.159> pinches<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.909> sugar<00:01:21.330> until<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> flavour

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
add pinches of sugar until the flavour

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.810 
add pinches of sugar until the flavour
balances<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:24.350> my<00:01:25.350> third<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> doing<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
balances out my third way of doing it is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.499 
balances out my third way of doing it is
just<00:01:27.210> adding<00:01:27.720> sugar<00:01:28.350> itself<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:30.270> using

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
just adding sugar itself if you're using

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.710 
just adding sugar itself if you're using
an<00:01:30.900> acidic<00:01:31.380> dip<00:01:31.970> then<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.299> need<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
an acidic dip then you don't need the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
an acidic dip then you don't need the
lemon<00:01:34.049> juice<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> wine<00:01:35.070> vinegar<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.700> just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
lemon juice or the wine vinegar you just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
lemon juice or the wine vinegar you just
need<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.390> counteract<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.350> pinches<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
need to counteract it with pinches of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.330 
need to counteract it with pinches of
sugar<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:39.210> three<00:01:39.570> cases<00:01:40.100> always<00:01:41.100> make

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sugar in all three cases always make

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
sugar in all three cases always make
sure<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.880> add<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:43.020> by<00:01:43.170> little

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
sure that you add it little by little

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
sure that you add it little by little
and<00:01:43.649> taste<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.490> you're<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.850> along<00:01:45.090> it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and taste it as you're going along it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
and taste it as you're going along it's
much<00:01:46.170> easier<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.920> correct<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.579> you're

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
much easier to correct it as you're

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.300 
much easier to correct it as you're
adding<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.409> add<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.590> much<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
adding it then if you add too much and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.370 
adding it then if you add too much and
then<00:01:50.549> try<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> come<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.450> correct<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
then try to come back and correct it

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.439 
then try to come back and correct it
