hi I'm Forbes jobby with NOAA Fisheries

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.500 
hi I'm Forbes jobby with NOAA Fisheries
we're<00:00:09.320> here<00:00:09.500> in<00:00:09.590> Ocean<00:00:09.889> City<00:00:10.070> Maryland<00:00:10.510> we're

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
we're here in Ocean City Maryland we're

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.009 
we're here in Ocean City Maryland we're
asking<00:00:11.900> folks<00:00:12.129> how<00:00:13.129> do<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:13.280> count<00:00:13.669> fish

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
asking folks how do you count fish

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.240 
asking folks how do you count fish
that's<00:00:15.019> a<00:00:15.110> really<00:00:15.349> good<00:00:15.499> question<00:00:15.559> i<00:00:16.070> have<00:00:16.190> no

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
that's a really good question i have no

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.750 
that's a really good question i have no
idea<00:00:17.500> how<00:00:18.500> many<00:00:18.560> there<00:00:18.800> are<00:00:18.860> dumb<00:00:19.100> i<00:00:19.990> think<00:00:20.990> 29

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
idea how many there are dumb i think 29

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.520 
idea how many there are dumb i think 29
you<00:00:22.760> take<00:00:22.970> everybody<00:00:23.390> captains<00:00:23.990> mates<00:00:24.260> you

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
you take everybody captains mates you

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.380 
you take everybody captains mates you
take<00:00:24.740> your<00:00:24.920> tallies<00:00:25.280> from<00:00:25.460> each<00:00:25.550> day<00:00:25.820> it's

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
take your tallies from each day it's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.550 
take your tallies from each day it's
probably<00:00:26.510> cut<00:00:26.900> it<00:00:26.990> in<00:00:27.050> about<00:00:27.200> forty<00:00:27.530> percent

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
probably cut it in about forty percent

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.890 
probably cut it in about forty percent
is<00:00:28.310> everybody<00:00:28.670> likes<00:00:28.850> your<00:00:28.970> library<00:00:29.420> how<00:00:29.750> much

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
is everybody likes your library how much

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.290 
is everybody likes your library how much
they<00:00:30.050> caught<00:00:30.260> that<00:00:30.290> day<00:00:30.850> all<00:00:31.850> great<00:00:32.090> answers

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
they caught that day all great answers

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.350 
they caught that day all great answers
but<00:00:32.930> not<00:00:33.079> quite<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:34.129> truth<00:00:34.370> is<00:00:34.610> we'll<00:00:35.120> never

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
but not quite the truth is we'll never

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.299 
but not quite the truth is we'll never
know<00:00:35.600> down<00:00:35.899> to<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.140> individual<00:00:36.559> fish<00:00:36.859> just

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
know down to the individual fish just

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.970 
know down to the individual fish just
how<00:00:37.460> many<00:00:37.699> are<00:00:37.910> caught<00:00:38.170> but<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:39.260> can<00:00:39.469> generate

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
how many are caught but we can generate

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.889 
how many are caught but we can generate
a<00:00:40.039> pretty<00:00:40.309> good<00:00:40.489> estimate<00:00:40.640> based<00:00:41.510> on<00:00:41.690> what<00:00:41.809> we

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
a pretty good estimate based on what we

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.319 
a pretty good estimate based on what we
can<00:00:42.109> tell<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.620> that<00:00:43.219> is<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.489> number<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:44.030> trips

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
can tell and that is the number of trips

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.540 
can tell and that is the number of trips
people<00:00:44.749> are<00:00:44.809> taking<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.949> effort<00:00:46.159> and<00:00:46.460> the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
people are taking the effort and the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.279 
people are taking the effort and the
number<00:00:47.089> of<00:00:47.149> fish<00:00:47.390> they're<00:00:47.659> catching<00:00:47.929> on<00:00:48.050> those

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
number of fish they're catching on those

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.840 
number of fish they're catching on those
trips<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:49.159> catch<00:00:50.170> just<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.199> second<00:00:51.850> generally

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
trips the catch just a second generally

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.239 
trips the catch just a second generally
speaking<00:00:52.969> Noah<00:00:53.960> estimates<00:00:54.469> effort<00:00:54.920> through

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
speaking Noah estimates effort through

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.520 
speaking Noah estimates effort through
telephone<00:00:55.640> surveys<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:56.870> estimate<00:00:57.199> catch

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
telephone surveys and we estimate catch

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.860 
telephone surveys and we estimate catch
through<00:00:57.979> dockside<00:00:58.399> sampling<00:00:58.909> so<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.719> catch

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
through dockside sampling so you catch

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.319 
through dockside sampling so you catch

whole population of fishermen that's how

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.520 
whole population of fishermen that's how

we can assess the health of fish stocks

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.630 
we can assess the health of fish stocks
managers<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:12.680> use<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:12.950> information<00:01:13.340> to
