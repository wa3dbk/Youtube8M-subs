may I would suggest chaotic weapons for

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.849 
may I would suggest chaotic weapons for
you<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.280> Prime<00:00:59.750> if<00:01:00.750> you've<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> 68

you you know Prime if you've got the 68

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.310 
you you know Prime if you've got the 68
circuit<00:01:02.280> I'd<00:01:02.430> take<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> over<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> onyx<00:01:04.140> ring

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
circuit I'd take that over the onyx ring

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620 
circuit I'd take that over the onyx ring
I<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> basically<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.030> something<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.479> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
or even a skill cape well it's best

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
or even a skill cape well it's best
there<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.950> I've<00:01:11.130> seen<00:01:11.310> people<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.700> ob
