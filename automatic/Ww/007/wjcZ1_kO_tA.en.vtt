it<00:06:04.699> might<00:06:04.789> have<00:06:04.879> helped<00:06:05.120> maybe<00:06:05.389> it<00:06:05.569> showed<00:06:05.840> you

some<00:06:06.409> useful<00:06:06.710> tips<00:06:07.069> for<00:06:07.219> debugging<00:06:07.819> I<00:06:08.210> could

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
some useful tips for debugging I could

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.390 
some useful tips for debugging I could
pretend<00:06:09.319> that<00:06:09.380> did<00:06:09.530> them<00:06:09.650> on<00:06:09.770> purpose<00:06:10.159> but

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
pretend that did them on purpose but

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.969 
pretend that did them on purpose but
that<00:06:10.639> would<00:06:10.819> be<00:06:10.849> a<00:06:11.000> lie<00:06:11.360> so<00:06:12.229> I'm<00:06:12.560> going<00:06:12.770> to<00:06:12.800> end

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
that would be a lie so I'm going to end

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.159 
that would be a lie so I'm going to end
