now<00:03:40.790> what<00:03:40.970> I'm<00:03:41.090> really<00:03:41.300> excited<00:03:41.480> by<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.019> what

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
now what I'm really excited by is what

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.080 
now what I'm really excited by is what
is<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.890> do<00:03:43.040> styling<00:03:43.370> products<00:03:43.970> when

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
is it that you do styling products when

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.910 
is it that you do styling products when
the<00:03:44.180> idea<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:44.959> can<00:03:45.170> do<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.350> hair<00:03:45.680> spray

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
the idea that you can do a hair spray

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.970 
the idea that you can do a hair spray
that<00:03:46.489> isn't<00:03:46.820> full<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.150> nasty<00:03:47.450> chemicals<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.650> a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
that isn't full of nasty chemicals is a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.540 
that isn't full of nasty chemicals is a
revelation<00:03:50.950> actually<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.220> our<00:03:52.370> hair

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
revelation actually because our hair

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.000 
revelation actually because our hair
spray<00:03:52.730> doesn't<00:03:52.970> even<00:03:53.060> contain<00:03:53.330> alcohol

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
spray doesn't even contain alcohol

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.160 
spray doesn't even contain alcohol
typically<00:03:55.010> when<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.280> have<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.580> wet<00:03:56.000> spray<00:03:56.510> you

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
typically when you have a wet spray you

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.710 
typically when you have a wet spray you
need<00:03:57.410> alcohol<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.400> help<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.820> product<00:03:59.570> come

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
need alcohol to help the product come

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.720 
need alcohol to help the product come
through<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.989> pump<00:04:00.230> yeah<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.040> make<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.550> for

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
through the pump yeah so to make up for

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.820 
through the pump yeah so to make up for
that<00:04:01.790> we<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.239> have<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:02.630> spray<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.140> hair

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
spray from a farther distance and that

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.710 
spray from a farther distance and that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
you're not gonna get that dry feeling

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.480 
you're not gonna get that dry feeling
that<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.850> get<00:04:12.120> from<00:04:12.450> an<00:04:12.600> aerosol<00:04:13.050> hairspray

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
that you get from an aerosol hairspray

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.980 
that you get from an aerosol hairspray
aerosols<00:04:14.490> can<00:04:14.670> tend<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.000> be<00:04:15.090> very<00:04:15.210> drying<00:04:15.630> and

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
aerosols can tend to be very drying and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.440 
aerosols can tend to be very drying and
typical<00:04:16.470> wet<00:04:16.650> sprays<00:04:17.120> often<00:04:18.120> containing

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
typical wet sprays often containing

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.930 
typical wet sprays often containing
alcohol<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:19.350> also<00:04:19.500> dry<00:04:19.890> your<00:04:20.070> hair<00:04:20.250> ours

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
alcohol can also dry your hair ours

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.990 
alcohol can also dry your hair ours
won't<00:04:21.359> do<00:04:21.570> any<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.470> because<00:04:23.250> there's<00:04:23.790> no

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
won't do any of this because there's no

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.820 
won't do any of this because there's no
alcohol<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.140> majority<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.620> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
alcohol in it and the majority of the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.790 
alcohol in it and the majority of the
gradients<00:04:26.610> are<00:04:26.880> from<00:04:27.540> botanical<00:04:27.900> oils<00:04:28.320> and

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
gradients are from botanical oils and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.430 
gradients are from botanical oils and
then<00:04:28.980> again<00:04:29.280> we<00:04:29.460> use<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.880> non<00:04:30.060> GMO<00:04:30.090> corn<00:04:30.990> as<00:04:31.410> a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
then again we use the non GMO corn as a

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.470 
then again we use the non GMO corn as a
holding<00:04:31.860> agent<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:32.730> that's<00:04:32.940> what<00:04:33.150> gives<00:04:33.300> the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
holding agent so that's what gives the

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.760 
holding agent so that's what gives the
hold<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.020> hair<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.380> does<00:04:34.560> actually

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
hold for the hair and it does actually

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.350 
hold for the hair and it does actually
hold<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.550> does<00:04:37.790> you're<00:04:38.790> not<00:04:38.940> gonna<00:04:39.090> get<00:04:39.330> that

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
hold it does you're not gonna get that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.320 
hold it does you're not gonna get that
concrete<00:04:46.400> okay<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.460> what<00:04:47.850> else<00:04:48.000> have<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.270> got

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
concrete okay so what else have you got

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
that we also have a volumizing mousse

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.090 
that we also have a volumizing mousse
which<00:04:51.210> will<00:04:51.390> foam<00:04:51.690> up<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:51.960> use<00:04:52.320> just<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.920> same

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
which will foam up and use just the same

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.070 
which will foam up and use just the same
way<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.310> would<00:04:53.550> use<00:04:53.580> any<00:04:54.000> mousse<00:04:54.360> whatsoever

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080

and this again contains the corn as the
holding<00:04:58.919> agent<00:04:59.280> but<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.550> also<00:04:59.700> has<00:04:59.970> a<00:05:00.000> lot<00:05:00.210> of

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
holding agent but it also has a lot of

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.180 
holding agent but it also has a lot of
