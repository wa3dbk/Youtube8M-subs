series<00:00:11.530> on<00:00:11.710> this<00:00:12.100> video<00:00:12.370> I'm<00:00:12.550> going<00:00:12.580> to

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
series on this video I'm going to

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.700 
series on this video I'm going to
quickly<00:00:12.910> show<00:00:13.059> you<00:00:13.300> how<00:00:13.840> to<00:00:13.900> properly<00:00:14.410> set<00:00:14.620> up

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
quickly show you how to properly set up

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.350 
quickly show you how to properly set up
your<00:00:14.800> control<00:00:15.130> surfaces<00:00:15.309> on<00:00:15.760> your<00:00:16.180> RC

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
your control surfaces on your RC

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.270 
your control surfaces on your RC
airplane<00:00:16.810> so<00:00:17.230> when<00:00:17.350> you<00:00:17.440> turn<00:00:17.680> left<00:00:17.920> your

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
airplane so when you turn left your

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.980 
airplane so when you turn left your
airplane<00:00:18.640> actually<00:00:19.000> turns<00:00:19.210> left<00:00:19.450> when<00:00:19.900> you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
airplane actually turns left when you

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.870 
airplane actually turns left when you
pull<00:00:20.230> up<00:00:20.260> your<00:00:20.590> airplane<00:00:21.010> actually<00:00:21.400> pulls<00:00:21.670> up

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
pull up your airplane actually pulls up

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.550 
pull up your airplane actually pulls up
so<00:00:22.420> let<00:00:22.539> me<00:00:22.570> walk<00:00:22.810> you<00:00:22.840> through<00:00:23.110> these<00:00:23.200> really

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
so let me walk you through these really

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.740 
so let me walk you through these really
quickly<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.130> most<00:00:24.310> common<00:00:24.730> setup<00:00:25.029> for<00:00:25.630> your

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
quickly the most common setup for your

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.070 
quickly the most common setup for your
elevator<00:00:26.260> is<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:27.099> be<00:00:27.220> backwards<00:00:27.820> of<00:00:28.119> your

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
elevator is to be backwards of your

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.190 
elevator is to be backwards of your
control<00:00:29.590> stick<00:00:29.859> so<00:00:30.099> if<00:00:30.189> i<00:00:30.279> push<00:00:30.609> this<00:00:31.210> way<00:00:31.480> the

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
control stick so if i push this way the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.220 
control stick so if i push this way the
elevator<00:00:32.860> moves<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.400> opposite<00:00:33.880> direction

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
elevator moves the opposite direction

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.890 
elevator moves the opposite direction
that<00:00:35.230> way<00:00:35.350> when<00:00:35.500> i<00:00:35.560> push<00:00:35.800> down<00:00:36.220> its<00:00:37.030> descending

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
that way when i push down its descending

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.540 
that way when i push down its descending
the<00:00:38.020> airplane<00:00:38.380> when<00:00:38.560> i<00:00:38.620> pull<00:00:38.920> back<00:00:39.340> on<00:00:39.520> the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
the airplane when i pull back on the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.700 
the airplane when i pull back on the
stick<00:00:39.640> when<00:00:40.059> i<00:00:40.120> pulled<00:00:40.360> back<00:00:40.570> into<00:00:41.230> airplane

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
stick when i pulled back into airplane

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.950 
stick when i pulled back into airplane
climbs<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.640> elevator<00:00:43.510> moves<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:43.899> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
climbs and the elevator moves in the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.420 
climbs and the elevator moves in the
opposite<00:00:44.320> direction<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:45.190> that's<00:00:45.340> the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
opposite direction so that's the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.229 
opposite direction so that's the
important<00:00:45.699> thing<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.879> remember<00:00:46.120> the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
important thing you remember the

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.729 
important thing you remember the
elevator<00:00:46.539> it<00:00:46.719> moves<00:00:47.050> in<00:00:47.170> an<00:00:47.260> opposite

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
elevator it moves in an opposite

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.729 
elevator it moves in an opposite
direction<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.329> rudder<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.590> one's

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
direction now the rudder is this one's

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.200 
direction now the rudder is this one's
easy<00:00:50.949> because<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.399> moves<00:00:51.610> in<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.879> same

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
easy because it moves in the same

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.349 
easy because it moves in the same
direction<00:00:52.390> right<00:00:53.260> is<00:00:53.410> right<00:00:53.440> left<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.100> left

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
direction right is right left is left

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.330 
direction right is right left is left
pretty<00:00:55.359> simple<00:00:55.539> on<00:00:55.750> that<00:00:55.870> one<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.800> ailerons

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
pretty simple on that one the ailerons

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.450 
pretty simple on that one the ailerons
whatever<00:00:58.149> direction<00:00:58.359> you<00:00:58.660> push<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.949> control

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
whatever direction you push that control

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.170 
whatever direction you push that control
surface<00:01:00.820> should<00:01:01.090> come<00:01:01.329> up<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.850> is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
surface should come up so that is

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.040 
surface should come up so that is
correct<00:01:04.600> see<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.500> right<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.900> how<00:01:07.990> that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
correct see that right see how that

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.300 
correct see that right see how that
aileron<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.650> moving<00:01:08.890> in<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.010> opposite

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
aileron is moving in the opposite

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.690 
aileron is moving in the opposite
direction<00:01:09.780> rolls<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.990> right<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
direction rolls it right and the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.330 
direction rolls it right and the
opposite<00:01:13.119> for<00:01:13.659> rolling<00:01:13.960> left<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:15.189> pretty

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
opposite for rolling left it's pretty

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.539 
opposite for rolling left it's pretty
simple<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:15.909> backwards<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:18.220> same<00:01:18.430> direction

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
simple so backwards the same direction

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.289 
simple so backwards the same direction
and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:20.200> in<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.710> direction<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.150> move

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
and then in the direction that you move

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.710 
and then in the direction that you move
the<00:01:22.390> control<00:01:22.689> surface<00:01:24.600> definitely<00:01:25.600> check

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
the control surface definitely check

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.569 
the control surface definitely check
this<00:01:25.869> every<00:01:26.079> time<00:01:26.560> before<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.920> take<00:01:27.100> off<00:01:27.250> I've

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
this every time before you take off I've

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.730 
this every time before you take off I've
got<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.030> to-do<00:01:28.450> list<00:01:28.720> every<00:01:29.079> time<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.409> take<00:01:29.590> off

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
got a to-do list every time I take off

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.289 
got a to-do list every time I take off
one<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.890> my<00:01:29.950> airplanes<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.640> one<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.090> very

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
one of my airplanes and one of the very

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.670 
one of my airplanes and one of the very
first<00:01:31.540> things<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:31.840> do<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.140> make<00:01:32.320> sure<00:01:32.350> my

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
first things I do is make sure my

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.410 
first things I do is make sure my
control<00:01:33.009> services<00:01:33.460> are<00:01:33.640> correct<00:01:34.240> orientation

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
control services are correct orientation

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.200 
control services are correct orientation
you<00:01:35.049> do<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.290> every<00:01:35.439> time<00:01:35.979> your<00:01:36.700> server<00:01:36.939> wires

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
you do that every time your server wires

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.700 
you do that every time your server wires
get<00:01:37.600> switched<00:01:37.840> up<00:01:38.079> as<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.320> connect<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.619> to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
get switched up as you connect it to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.289 
get switched up as you connect it to
your<00:01:38.770> transmitter<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:40.000> have<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.270> a

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
your transmitter you can have the a

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.880 
your transmitter you can have the a
different<00:01:40.750> model<00:01:40.930> on<00:01:41.229> your<00:01:41.380> transmitter

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
different model on your transmitter

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.499 
different model on your transmitter
there's<00:01:42.399> tons<00:01:42.729> different<00:01:43.090> things<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.390> could

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
there's tons different things that could

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.389 
there's tons different things that could
go<00:01:43.540> wrong<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.680> switch<00:01:44.920> these<00:01:45.040> control

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
go wrong to switch these control

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.609 
go wrong to switch these control
services<00:01:45.820> around<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.329> trust<00:01:47.259> me<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.380> do<00:01:47.590> not

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
services around and trust me you do not

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.800 
services around and trust me you do not
want<00:01:47.829> to<00:01:48.100> do<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.310> wrong<00:01:48.520> or<00:01:48.759> backwards<00:01:49.180> even<00:01:49.689> an

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
want to do it wrong or backwards even an

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.240 
want to do it wrong or backwards even an
experienced<00:01:50.259> pilot<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.680> would<00:01:50.799> be<00:01:50.920> pretty

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
experienced pilot that would be pretty

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.760 
experienced pilot that would be pretty
much<00:01:51.490> immediate<00:01:52.299> destruction<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:53.619> few

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
much immediate destruction very few
