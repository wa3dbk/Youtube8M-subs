00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.940
 Welcome to la la style today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 I show you how your face is 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 could contour and marry that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.429
 Whole as always like everything I am 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.840
 show pretty fast 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.580
 I wish you much fun with the video 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.020
 I 'm already enjoying watching 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 and above all, have fun 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.539
 After all, make-up first 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 concealer I have one here from astor 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.660
 in the color 1 1 draw and with concealer 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.470
 Let's go under the eyes here and now 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470
 here on the bridge of the nose 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.780
 this is important to the whole good 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.780
 dazzle 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.870
 everything we control is what we do 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.550
 dark guard field in the face 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.800
 while what we all do or do 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.420
 make it difficult to stand out 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.200
 namely a control of patrice 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.660
 paul paul and will now here 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.940
 to carry cheekbones under which the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.180
 face a bit faster here 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.729
 appears and you can so completely 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.810
 Feel good so listened to that means here 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.830
 it's this line 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.229
 You can also do such a fish and do it 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.220
 and then the line also comes to who 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.320
 was revealed 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.450
 you realize you go from up here where 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.229
 it comes to quasi out of the head 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.020
 over here 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.610
 this line to the mouth of course 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.330
 not quite up to the muzzle angle sun 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.759
 starts about good eye and accurately 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.100
 makes this line dark I take now 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.970
 here on the finger a little bit 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:04.020
 then this line would then be in side 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.020
 would it be this 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.039
 it can be so dazzled me of course 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 Later, it just makes it easy 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.069
 to show more exactly 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.000
 as well I have to chmelar the nose 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:24.000
 make-up you want to make the pages 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.400
 from the nose darker is quite like that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.180
 Of course, here too, blinded 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 so far the aasee will pay 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.630
 So now I take such a soft here 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.110
 half-rounded brush and blinded 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.110
 the whole 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.359
 With 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.390
 thought 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.600
 on 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.100
 For the nose you can brush this 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.650
 can also take here then 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.450
 Press a bit flat and then to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.290
 use or just one 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 smaller brush 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.140
 so now we have that blinded 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.180
 this line dazzles just like that 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.980
 Dark line here on the side of the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.900
 nasa if you have a little more 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.490
 would like to apply then just take that 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.110
 with brush on but that blinded 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.460
 really nice that it really too 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.070
 of course looks 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.750
 you can opti if you stand yours 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.720
 want to reduce up here again 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.490
 Apply dark powder or you can 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.690
 also here on the sides must go ins 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.110
 face the even more money too 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.790
 do 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.100
 so now they have been contoured as 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.500
 next i want to apply rouge me 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.420
 take for such a very big rouge 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.540
 and a little bigger too 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.100
 Rounded brush to apply 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.180
 Sex should be a bit then 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.980
 I go here on the cheeks and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.710
 blinds it up 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.310
 with this dark contoured here 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.430
 line 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.210
 It is a transition and not a hard one 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.210
 has edges 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.990
 from 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.650
 but as a last resort we ask 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.930
 now a highlighter on and on 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.300
 the highest point of the cheekbone and 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.320
 Blend this again with the call that 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.300
 We also have a nice one here 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.020
 I have married for that transition 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.570
 Use is one of manhattan healer 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.690
 the break is back in it as a 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.540
 Sponge is very handy and me 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.110
 take this pink or something like that 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.510
 from these pink to bronze to gold above 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.830
 which used it also became rarer too 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.229
 Now that I'm such a mix 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.979
 both at the highest point though 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.979
 is blinded 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.389
 because 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.389
 approximately 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.680
 I wear it on the bridge of my nose too 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.720
 a little bit because we are here at the 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.400
 side the nose have checked that 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.520
 she looks like a blacksmith 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.960
 and if I'm here again in the middle 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.430
 light powder goes then just emphasizes it 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.639
 again this effect and in general 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.660
 through this hey people a fresh out 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.660
 and simply radiant
