hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:23.200
Today we're going to make tindora, this is small gherkin that is very popular in India and you know, you can make various preparaions with this.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.100
Today we're going to stuff and fry them. This is going to be super awesome. Let's learn how to make this

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:40.920
You know to cut this tindora all you need to do is just remove off the edges and then you can cut half like this and then again cut them into quarters

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:53.200
This is one method of doing easy. Another method what we usually do is, cut the tindora like then and then cut like this one side

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:04.820
and the next side turn it and then here just cut like this. That way you will have one of this way; one of this way and you can stuff in this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.740
and this method of doing the tindora will retain it's shape much better than cutting them into quarters.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:27.020
Let's go ahead and make a masala for this. For this, take red chilli, coriander seeds, chana dal, urad dal and some rice

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:35.500
and we're going to slowly dry roast them on a very slow flame till they are slightly colored and give a nice fragrance

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.840
When they are slightly cooked, add sesame seeds and the sesame seeds will cook much faster so it won't take much time

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:56.060
just for a minute or so and then switch off the flame. In this add small pieces of tamarind and also add coconut powder.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.880
Ok. This is homemade coconut powder so that is why the color is like that. And now all of this we're going to put in a blender

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.440
and going to make into a coarse paste and you can also add little water to make the paste

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:24.700
and once you grind this mixture just add some salt and mix this. Now take this masala and stuff it in this tindora

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.920
Ok. Look at this. Like this.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:40.040
and the other ones just take it, just make a opening and put some of the masala on one side and turn to the other side, and open it and put some more masala on this side

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:49.560
So this will have masala from both ends. Ok. Now let's go ahead and do for all this tindora

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.180
Now look at these tindora. I've stuffed all of them and they are perfectly stuffed

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.140
See take a pan which is flat and big, so that each tindora has to touch the pan when you're frying this

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:20.460
So in this add some oil, when the oil is hot add mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds splutter add cumin seeds, add pinch of turmeric and drop in all the tindora into this oil

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.740
Make sure that all of these tindoras are touching the pan and just rotate like this, so that the oil is also nicely evenly distributed

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.560
and because these tindoras will take some time to cook, we're going to cook it on a slow flame for around 15-20 minutes.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:46.640
Put the lid on, you know just occasionally remove the lid and just rotate it like this so that the tindoras turn and get nice and evenly cooked

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:55.240
Now in this, you know just add some chopped onions now because this is going to get cooked for another 15 minutes

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:07.920
So this will also will get cooked. In this add chopped green chillis and pinch of salt not too much just little bit of salt; already the masala has salt

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.140
So, and then add in some curry leaves and then again add the lid on and we're going to cook for another 10 minutes.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.140
Now after total around of 20-25 minutes my tindora that is a small baby gherkins they're all perfectly done

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.940
and finish it off by adding some chopped coriander and wow!

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.020
These are fantastic and look at that each of this tindora is holding masala because of the way we cut those tindoras

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.360
and this is one of the easiest and tastiest dish to make. Put the lid on, switch off flame and eat it after 3-4 mintues.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.920
and they will be super and tasty.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:58.700
You have to look at this tindora, the stuffing is so intact and the onions even though I added them half way, now they are nicely cooked and nicely coated with the masala.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.020
and with those onions slightly sweeter and the inside masala little bit sour and spicy.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:16.640
Dear friends very easy to make, very tasty and I'm telling you these stuffed ones are better among the tindora preparation, this method of making tindora is just super awesome.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.580
And if you make this kind of tindora I'm telling you this will be you're favourite tindora.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.340
Dear friends with every bite, you have to make a noise ssshhhh!!

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.920
wow! Look at this! huh!

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.460
They are perfectly cooked and literally melting in the mouth. Soft and juicy and all the masaledaar

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.600
