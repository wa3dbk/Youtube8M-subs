00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.510
 hello girls welcome to this new one 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.370
 video I want to teach them a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.250
 really very nice mixture very much 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.470
 effect is a false myth then you 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.660
 mix less pretended to mix 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.129
 and the top card is above and therefore 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.379
 that's all 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.379
 we are immediately to say everything 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.470
 then we start with the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.760
 we have fingers in this one 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.620
 position then here then index here 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.900
 above then on the side on the short side 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.090
 of the paper at the top and on the long side 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.590
 of the right card we find the best 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.570
 work and the little finger 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.130
 in this position at this point 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 we have to create three bunches then 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.790
 bring the right hand closer 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.410
 here we put the medium here we put 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.240
 the forefinger and then under the thumb 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.050
 we pass the first bunch with the hand 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.510
 left with the index and the other bundle 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.930
 with the fashion index in this 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.380
 way 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.380
 123 then do this case the process 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.910
 bunches that will form to this 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.430
 point we have to bring the bunch in 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.890
 half as last bundle of 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.800
 consequently we move to the left 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.170
 the last bunch of so we turn everything 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.940
 the deck and take with the thumb and col 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.070
 average everything and we turn so then 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.380
 let's make 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.100
 we take the bunch in the middle so it 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:09.010
 let's take it from the thumb and 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:10.780
 we turn everything ok so we do so if 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.640
 there is no 10 to take it with a medium 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.290
 take it with your thumb as well 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.769
 excused with the ring finger that is not so much 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.760
 problem so perfect at this point 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:26.050
 we have to create another bundle like this 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.620
 so let's do this this and col 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.150
 we take the thumb of the left hand 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.590
 leaving it therefore from the thumb of the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 right hand including almost thumb years 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.430
 of the left hand takes it and I have it 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.720
 left to the thumb of the right hand 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.590
 we must carry it as a second 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.610
 as a result we do so e 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.120
 we bring it to this point we have 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.049
 the first bunch placed with the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.750
 average and the index from both now not 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.430
 we take the medium off because we will need it 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.890
 to do what now 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.959
 so we will do so this way 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.540
 let us take the second as we leave the middle 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.510
 and we both hold the index to this 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.420
 point what we must do we must 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.769
 overturn the second bunch of 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.870
 consequently we think between average emulate 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.340
 the second bunch collects money 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.650
 hence from this position 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.840
 the first murderer passes this and it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.489
 we think 3 medium is cancel in this 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.650
 way 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.379
 after which at the very moment in which 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.579
 we think this will drop too 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:44.230
 this bunch so we do it all 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:53.260
 so we start this and drops 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:55.629
 this too so let's start a 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.280
 this point we support this bunch 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.939
 and we also support this accordingly 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.840
 we bring it here and what will happen 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.489
 the last step will be to 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.769
 bring back all the cards on top of the 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.840
 bat then give a little hard to 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.650
 do I will try to do it then vi 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.650
 let's do everything slowly 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.230
 which is then we see better the last one 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.810
 passage 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.680
 at this point we change between medium and 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.780
 the better we bring it as an index we start 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.670
 a second bunch with cancel medium 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.980
 then the medium above which touches the 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.450
 face and not live 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.140
 sorry for the best under which it touches the 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.240
 face and ring finger above this point 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.060
 let's drop this back even 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.540
 this bunch and we ask for due in 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.540
 this way 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.080
 this point makes you 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.650
 prefer the 20 or one note 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.430
 from 5 20 which original choice 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.300
 fine speaks but anchored looks 5 euros 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.690
 quite right 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.860
 are 27 of paintings to the chosen paper yes 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.200
 perfect today made to see how to win 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.540
 20 euros next time maybe you 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.960
 I explain how to lose 5 euros for a card 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.960
 choice
