gold blush look my goal as a breeder
specifically<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.559> breeder<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> Mojave<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
specifically as a breeder of Mojave is

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
specifically as a breeder of Mojave is
through<00:00:37.320> selective<00:00:37.860> breeding<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
through selective breeding to really to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.610 
through selective breeding to really to
try<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> redefine<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.910> way<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.750> Mojave

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
try to redefine the way that a Mojave

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.660 
try to redefine the way that a Mojave
looks<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.860> colors<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
looks as you can see the colors in this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.170 
looks as you can see the colors in this
snake<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:49.010> ones<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.219> typically<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.850> show

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
snake are ones that typically don't show

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
snake are ones that typically don't show
up<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:52.260> standard<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:55.129> common

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
up in your standard or your your common

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
up in your standard or your your common
Mojave<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.739> again<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.070> my<00:01:00.079> goal<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
Mojave and again and my goal is a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.390 
Mojave and again and my goal is a
breeder<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.789> redefine<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:05.159> way

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
breeder is to really redefine the way

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
breeder is to really redefine the way
that<00:01:05.790> Mojave<00:01:06.390> looks<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:09.210> through

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that Mojave looks and I think through

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.330 
that Mojave looks and I think through
time<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.409> through<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.710> selective<00:01:11.159> breeding

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
time and through a selective breeding

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880 
time and through a selective breeding
and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.390> fact<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.650> first

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and the fact that this is my first

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.870 
and the fact that this is my first
inbred<00:01:14.580> clutch<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.810> I'm<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.610> have<00:01:17.610> fun

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
inbred clutch that I'm going to have fun

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.730 
inbred clutch that I'm going to have fun
at<00:01:18.090> least<00:01:18.270> trying<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.759> accomplish<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.119> goal

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
at least trying to accomplish that goal

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.929 
at least trying to accomplish that goal
so<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.700> 2008<00:01:24.530> she's<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.939> five

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so this is a 2008 she's about five

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.130 
so this is a 2008 she's about five
thousand<00:01:27.420> grams<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.390> my<00:01:30.390> goal<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
thousand grams and my goal will be to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
thousand grams and my goal will be to
breed<00:01:31.500> her<00:01:31.680> probably<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:33.049> 2010<00:01:34.159> actually<00:01:35.299> 2011

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
breed her probably in 2010 actually 2011

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.740 
breed her probably in 2010 actually 2011
and<00:01:36.509> probably<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.320> likely<00:01:37.640> 2012<00:01:38.640> based<00:01:39.540> on

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and probably more likely 2012 based on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.800 
and probably more likely 2012 based on
her<00:01:39.960> feeding<00:01:40.380> response<00:01:40.880> not<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.270> best<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
her feeding response not the best that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.440 
her feeding response not the best that
I've<00:01:42.930> ever<00:01:43.049> seen<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.729> thought<00:01:44.939> I'd<00:01:45.119> show

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I've ever seen but I thought I'd show

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.530 
I've ever seen but I thought I'd show
you<00:01:45.509> guys<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.040> consider<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.970> best<00:01:50.540> female

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Mojave and again she just exudes the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.920 
Mojave and again she just exudes the
color<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.719> pattern<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> I<00:02:00.500> did<00:02:01.500> I
