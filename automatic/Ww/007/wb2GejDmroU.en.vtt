actually<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.820> easiest<00:00:59.150> thing<00:00:59.450> ever<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.780> it's

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
actually the easiest thing ever and it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.600 
actually the easiest thing ever and it's
totally<00:01:00.350> replaced<00:01:00.800> my<00:01:00.950> other<00:01:01.100> curling<00:01:01.460> wands

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
totally replaced my other curling wands

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.400 
totally replaced my other curling wands
it's<00:01:01.910> this<00:01:02.059> automatic<00:01:02.570> curler<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.230> don't

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's this automatic curler so you don't

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.689 
it's this automatic curler so you don't
even<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.800> like<00:01:03.950> hold<00:01:04.100> your<00:01:04.280> arm<00:01:04.430> up<00:01:04.550> or

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
even have to like hold your arm up or

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.219 
even have to like hold your arm up or
anything<00:01:04.910> really<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:05.570> can<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:05.869> have<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.050> by

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
anything really you can just have it by

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.020 
anything really you can just have it by
your<00:01:06.380> side<00:01:06.590> because<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.430> wand<00:01:07.820> goes

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
your side because the wand goes

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.180 
your side because the wand goes
vertically<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.320> best<00:01:09.500> part<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:10.040> that

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
vertically and the best part is is that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.100 
vertically and the best part is is that
it<00:01:10.310> prevents<00:01:10.700> me<00:01:10.729> from<00:01:10.850> burning<00:01:11.510> my<00:01:11.660> hand<00:01:11.930> off

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
it prevents me from burning my hand off

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.780 
it prevents me from burning my hand off
because<00:01:12.619> whenever<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.100> wrap<00:01:13.369> my<00:01:13.520> hair<00:01:13.700> around

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
because whenever I wrap my hair around

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.730 
because whenever I wrap my hair around
the<00:01:13.970> wand<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.450> would<00:01:14.570> always<00:01:14.810> burn<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:15.590> now<00:01:15.680> I

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
the wand it would always burn so now I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.840 
the wand it would always burn so now I
don't<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.130> problem<00:01:16.310> which<00:01:16.700> I

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
don't have that problem which I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.820 
don't have that problem which I
definitely<00:01:17.390> like<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:18.080> creates<00:01:18.350> these<00:01:18.470> super

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
definitely like it creates these super

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.530 
definitely like it creates these super
nice<00:01:19.010> tangle<00:01:19.460> free<00:01:19.490> curls<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.300> are<00:01:20.390> just

you<00:01:45.289> can<00:01:45.410> either<00:01:45.530> curl<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.979> left<00:01:46.130> or<00:01:46.280> right

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
you can either curl it left or right

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.620 
you can either curl it left or right
which<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.759> cool<00:01:46.940> because<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.180> can<00:01:47.210> still<00:01:47.479> get

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
which is cool because you can still get

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.969 
which is cool because you can still get
the<00:01:47.780> curls<00:01:48.350> going<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.649> different<00:01:48.740> directions

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.300 

it<00:01:53.689> works<00:01:53.899> really<00:01:54.140> fast<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:54.920> only<00:01:55.069> have<00:01:55.159> to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
it works really fast so you only have to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.069 
it works really fast so you only have to
hold<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.579> for<00:01:55.729> like<00:01:55.789> five<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.270> ten<00:01:56.420> seconds<00:01:56.869> I

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
hold it for like five to ten seconds I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
to kind of brush about to make them look

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.420 
to kind of brush about to make them look
more<00:03:30.750> natural<00:03:30.930> because<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.470> don't<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.800> really

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430
