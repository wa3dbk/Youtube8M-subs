okay<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:09.330> round<00:00:09.660> by<00:00:10.200> bowflex<00:00:10.469> them<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.190> I'm

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
okay I'm round by bowflex them and I'm

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.459 
okay I'm round by bowflex them and I'm
excited<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.480> video<00:00:12.660> because<00:00:13.020> we<00:00:13.139> are

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
excited about this video because we are

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.940 
excited about this video because we are
in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.770> lab<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.520> this<00:00:15.150> machine<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.740> one<00:00:16.740> that

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
in the lab and this machine is one that

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.790 
in the lab and this machine is one that
you've<00:00:17.100> heard<00:00:17.280> about<00:00:18.110> you<00:00:19.110> know<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.530> don't

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
you've heard about you know you don't

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
you've heard about you know you don't
know<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.610> you've<00:00:20.789> heard<00:00:20.940> the<00:00:21.480> qub

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
know what it is but you've heard the qub

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
know what it is but you've heard the qub
testing<00:00:22.770> this<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.030> is<00:00:24.240> an

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
testing this one right here is an

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.220 
testing this one right here is an
accelerated<00:00:25.850> weathering<00:00:26.850> tester<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
accelerated weathering tester what this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.830 
accelerated weathering tester what this
machine<00:00:28.380> does<00:00:28.620> is<00:00:29.040> we<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.460> samples<00:00:30.270> of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
machine does is we put samples of

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840 
machine does is we put samples of
various<00:00:31.260> films<00:00:31.680> that<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.129> to<00:00:32.160> test<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
various films that we want to test in

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880 
various films that we want to test in
this<00:00:33.270> machine<00:00:33.450> I'll<00:00:33.930> show<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.620> isn't<00:00:34.770> in

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this machine I'll show it just isn't in

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.700 
this machine I'll show it just isn't in
a<00:00:34.980> second<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.840> we<00:00:36.840> don't<00:00:37.050> install<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.590> any

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a second and we don't install it on any

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
a second and we don't install it on any
glass<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.460> put<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.909> on<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.929> slides

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
glass we just put them in on the slides

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.649 
glass we just put them in on the slides
without<00:00:40.440> installing<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> film<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.089> in<00:00:42.449> this

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
without installing the film and in this

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.549 
without installing the film and in this
this<00:00:42.839> machine<00:00:43.230> does<00:00:43.409> three<00:00:43.649> things<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:45.170> it<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
this machine does three things it it it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.719 
this machine does three things it it it
has<00:00:46.829> constant<00:00:47.609> UV<00:00:48.179> exposure<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> film<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
has constant UV exposure to the film it

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.369 
has constant UV exposure to the film it
has<00:00:51.469> heat<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.859> it<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:53.699> adds<00:00:54.149> humidity<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
has heat and it also adds humidity and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.469 
has heat and it also adds humidity and
on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> side<00:00:55.979> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> machine<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.729> where<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
on the side of the machine is where the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.389 
on the side of the machine is where the
humidity<00:00:57.749> is<00:00:58.139> introduced<00:00:58.710> into<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> machine

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
humidity is introduced into the machine

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
humidity is introduced into the machine
these<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.929> gauges<00:01:01.409> that

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
these are just the gauges that

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
these are just the gauges that
demonstrate<00:01:02.389> basically<00:01:03.389> you<00:01:03.749> know<00:01:03.839> how<00:01:04.019> long

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
demonstrate basically you know how long

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.560 
demonstrate basically you know how long
the<00:01:04.409> films<00:01:04.710> been<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.909> monitor<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the films been in so we can monitor we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
the films been in so we can monitor we
generally<00:01:07.080> test<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> films<00:01:08.210> incrementally

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
generally test the films incrementally

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.070 
generally test the films incrementally
in<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.600> machine<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.700> 100<00:01:11.700> hours<00:01:12.060> 300<00:01:12.750> hours

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
in this machine in 100 hours 300 hours

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.040 
in this machine in 100 hours 300 hours
usually<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> about<00:01:14.310> 1000<00:01:14.940> hours<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.870> can

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
usually up to about 1000 hours we can

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.480 
usually up to about 1000 hours we can
begin<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.620> a<00:01:16.650> trend<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
begin to see a trend if there's a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
begin to see a trend if there's a
problem<00:01:17.840> in<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> early<00:01:18.960> stages<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.740> after

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
problem in the early stages but after

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.650 
problem in the early stages but after
1000<00:01:20.610> hours<00:01:20.730> we<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.450> final

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
1000 hours we can see the final

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.350 
1000 hours we can see the final
conclusion<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.980> what's<00:01:23.370> going<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.580> happen<00:01:24.000> but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
conclusion of what's going to happen but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
conclusion of what's going to happen but
basically<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:25.020> we're<00:01:25.140> trying<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.410> do<00:01:25.560> if

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
basically what we're trying to do if

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010 
basically what we're trying to do if
this<00:01:25.800> this<00:01:26.430> method<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> testing<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.750> we're

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this this method of testing is we're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
this this method of testing is we're
simply<00:01:28.410> trying<00:01:28.620> to<00:01:28.680> determine<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.640> how

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
simply trying to determine you know how

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.570 
simply trying to determine you know how
likely<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.380> probable<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.010> this<00:01:32.160> film<00:01:32.370> is

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
likely or how probable of this film is

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.000 
likely or how probable of this film is
to<00:01:32.610> fade<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.630> we're<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.050> do<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:34.770> three

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
to fade and we're gonna do these three

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.560 
to fade and we're gonna do these three
things<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:35.880> where<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.420> films<00:01:36.810> come<00:01:37.230> out

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.780 

hit<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.080> stop<00:01:40.320> button<00:01:42.830> don't<00:01:43.830> get<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.010> stop

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
yes stop okay now I want to show you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.800 
yes stop okay now I want to show you
what's<00:01:52.229> inside<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.740> machine<00:01:53.479> each<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.689> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
what's inside the machine each one of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.870 
what's inside the machine each one of
these<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.140> different<00:01:55.409> slides<00:01:55.920> we're

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
these are just different slides we're

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:10.900 
these are just different slides we're
going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.649> choose<00:01:58.649> one<00:02:01.070> cheese

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:26.860 

I<00:02:10.940> got<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.630> wrong<00:02:11.780> one<00:02:12.099> don't<00:02:13.099> want<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.340> one

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.310 

we've<00:02:27.870> added<00:02:28.080> two<00:02:28.560> films<00:02:29.550> here<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.990> can

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
we've added two films here and I can

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.980 
we've added two films here and I can
actually<00:02:31.560> remove<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.490> plate<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:33.810> my

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
actually remove this plate to get my

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
actually remove this plate to get my
samples<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:35.370> there's<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:36.330> part<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> this

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
samples that there's a part of this

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.100 
samples that there's a part of this
where<00:02:38.010> that's<00:02:38.370> exposed<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.270> then<00:02:39.870> there's<00:02:40.050> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
where that's exposed and then there's a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.690 
where that's exposed and then there's a
part<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> film<00:02:40.710> that's<00:02:40.980> not<00:02:41.220> exposed

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
part of the film that's not exposed

there's a lot of mirrors in here so

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.270 
there's a lot of mirrors in here so
there's<00:05:39.360> constant<00:05:39.600> exposure<00:05:40.280> there's

if<00:05:44.700> necessary<00:05:45.240> we<00:05:45.389> can<00:05:45.540> even<00:05:45.690> control<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.650> add

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
if necessary we can even control and add

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.220 
if necessary we can even control and add
bits<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.880> get<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.210> full<00:05:48.389> the<00:05:48.780> weather<00:05:48.990> will

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
bits to get the full the weather will

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.840 
bits to get the full the weather will
affect<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:50.120> again<00:05:51.120> this<00:05:51.360> is<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.570> better<00:05:52.020> faster

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
affect and again this is a better faster

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.940 
affect and again this is a better faster
stronger<00:05:53.850> machine<00:05:54.360> than<00:05:54.660> the<00:05:54.780> old<00:05:54.960> QB<00:05:55.530> but<00:05:55.830> we

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
stronger machine than the old QB but we

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.370 
stronger machine than the old QB but we
do<00:05:56.190> use<00:05:56.400> both<00:05:56.669> machines<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.360> get<00:05:57.510> different

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
do use both machines to get different

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.750 
do use both machines to get different
results<00:05:58.680> that<00:05:58.980> we're<00:05:59.160> looking<00:05:59.250> forward<00:05:59.669> to

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
results that we're looking forward to

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.879 
results that we're looking forward to
getting<00:05:59.820> but<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:00.450> we<00:06:00.570> can<00:06:00.720> tell<00:06:00.990> you<00:06:01.020> what's

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
getting but so we can tell you what's

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.870 
getting but so we can tell you what's
going<00:06:02.040> to<00:06:02.070> happen<00:06:02.450> this<00:06:03.450> is<00:06:03.510> it

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
going to happen this is it

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.710 
going to happen this is it
everybody<00:06:05.880> needs<00:06:06.090> one<00:06:06.150> of<00:06:06.270> these<00:06:06.419> in<00:06:06.630> their

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
everybody needs one of these in their

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.840 
everybody needs one of these in their
house<00:06:06.930> I'm<00:06:07.830> gonna<00:06:08.010> say<00:06:08.130> about<00:06:08.340> getting<00:06:08.550> me<00:06:08.669> one

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
house I'm gonna say about getting me one
