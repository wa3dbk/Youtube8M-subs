00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 welcome to my channel if garcia sanz and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 Here I bring you a new guide as I already 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.210
 I said I was going to do several and this time 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.310
 It deals with the location of the rifles 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.869
 of assault on the iv gta map I'm going to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.400
 continue with the other weapons and started 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 for assault rifles because they are the ones 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.190
 more are usually used so we're going to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.170
 start with the first location 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.210
 in this first location we have to 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.440
 go to the military base of fort zancudo 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.240
 that as I see it on the map 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.830
 because I do not remove it because the gameplay 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.570
 we have to come to the back 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.970
 of the entry or the other entry that 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.190
 have we can enter with a vehicle 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.900
 same as in the other but this one is going 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.870
 to warn in military that we can not 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.910
 spend and good is that the soul is just 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.100
 in behind the cabin that is 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.120
 well in there then to catch it 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.920
 Well maybe this is the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.780
 the most difficult location since 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 we have to kill surely that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.170
 military because as soon as the fence breaks 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.330
 is going to start shooting so what 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.560
 first thing I do is kill you enter and 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.869
 at the beginning like I did not know where I was 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.390
 Well, I lost a bit but it's just 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.070
 there behind you see how it blinks I'm 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.619
 seeing and then well we have to be 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.570
 fast so that by having four 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.800
 stars are going to burst for sure 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.710
 good in tanks and helicopters 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.170
 et cetera so let's go for the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 second 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 the next one is in this detour 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 I think you can see wood and the other 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.030
 I do not know exactly but well now what 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.680
 you will see on the map because in this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.649
 case yes I show it inside the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.450
 gameplay and it's right at the crossroad 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.490
 supported on this hedge of these 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.979
 palm trees and how the time it flashes 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.869
 As usual, it's always an Ak-47 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.500
 so well here you have the second 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.500
 location 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.400
 the third if I'm not wrong is in a 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.870
 cement factory right at the entrance 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.120
 as it is boiling I park the 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.470
 helicopter and just behind the post I know 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.140
 that I'm going to point out right now because 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.450
 find this ak-47 rifle is pretty 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.220
 easy to see and does not require any 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.870
 skill as we have seen the first 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.030
 that since we could leave 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.979
 a military man and now I'm going to teach where 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 it is right, it is the part of 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.020
 well more desert say the map of 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.210
 gta 5 so well there you have it 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.800
 the penultimate is a little harder to 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.640
 find since you are in the middle 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.290
 from the mountain next to the river then it 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.120
 camouflages a little with the earth and me 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 It cost a bit to see it but well there 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 you have more or less took the reference 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.820
 of the bridge so you can see it more or less 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 where is it and to the other side too 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.980
 I will also show where it is in the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.530
 map so good here I leave this 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.810
 fourth and penultimate as you are going to see the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.500
 map because it is right next to the river that 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.910
 we have the let's say northeast we see more like that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.670
 that we are going for the fifth and last weapon 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.890
 and the fifth and last assault rifle was 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.770
 find one of the ends of the map 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.330
 of gta next to paleto bay and just in 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.640
 the typical bank that goes into the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.350
 films focused on the sea as it 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.530
 find this assault rifle to what 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.660
 show where he is 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.370
 in the location of the map I tell you 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.950
 which is an extreme that is quite easy 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.980
 to get right through the back 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.620
 They are like sites of 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.720
 exercise and so on so good here you 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.510
 so I leave this location guide 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.489
 weapons I hope you like it then that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.350
 I reflect it with a like if you want it 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.420
 raise the sniper submachine guns 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.010
 I will have more weapons, what more are there 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.080
 body armor that already follows 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.760
 bringing up so nothing if you like the 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.290
 idea that it continues to attract guides so 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.239
 said leave it in the comments in the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.050
 likes and see you in the next video 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.050
 until next time
