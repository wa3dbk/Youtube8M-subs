the only reason why I enjoy playing on
the<00:04:05.459> PlayStation<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.269> because<00:04:06.630> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the PlayStation is because the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.229 
the PlayStation is because the
controller<00:04:07.170> fits<00:04:07.830> better<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.220> my<00:04:08.340> hands<00:04:08.820> I'm<00:04:08.940> a

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
one-handed gamer I prefer it so that's

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.789 
one-handed gamer I prefer it so that's

chat system which you know the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.990 
chat system which you know the
playstation<00:04:18.600> 3<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.229> outdated<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:20.010> it's

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
playstation 3 is so outdated and it's

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
playstation 3 is so outdated and it's
just<00:04:21.239> it's<00:04:21.630> confusing<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.740> know<00:04:22.770> there's<00:04:23.190> so

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
just it's confusing you know there's so

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.310 
just it's confusing you know there's so
many<00:04:23.430> different<00:04:23.580> options<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.570> they<00:04:25.050> kind<00:04:25.260> of

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
many different options and they kind of

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.860 
many different options and they kind of
made<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.620> like<00:04:25.740> an<00:04:25.890> entertainment<00:04:26.640> thing

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
made it like an entertainment thing

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.830 
made it like an entertainment thing
not<00:04:27.110> really<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.500> gaming<00:04:27.979> thing<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.840> so

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
not really a gaming thing and so

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.990 
not really a gaming thing and so
hopefully<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.410> new<00:04:30.590> systems<00:04:31.130> will<00:04:31.490> work<00:04:31.520> and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
hopefully the new systems will work and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.450 
hopefully the new systems will work and
they<00:04:32.630> will<00:04:32.720> be<00:04:32.780> almost<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.740> know<00:04:33.830> identical

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
they will be almost you know identical

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.189 
they will be almost you know identical
so<00:04:34.669> really<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.240> know<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:35.479> kind<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.840> just<00:04:36.050> had

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
to actually come out with their system

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.659 
to actually come out with their system
before<00:04:44.600> PlayStation<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.770> seems<00:04:46.010> like

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
before PlayStation but it seems like

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.450 
before PlayStation but it seems like
there's<00:04:47.449> some<00:04:47.720> information<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.979> rumored

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.490 
there's some information that is rumored
that<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.790> could<00:04:50.000> actually<00:04:50.030> derail<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.260> launch

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
that it could actually derail the launch

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.180 
that it could actually derail the launch
and<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.340> launch<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.940> predicted<00:04:53.720> at<00:04:54.190> 2013

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
and the launch is predicted at 2013

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.870 
and the launch is predicted at 2013
which<00:04:55.490> is<00:04:55.669> summer<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:56.690> more<00:04:57.050> likely<00:04:57.880> they're

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880

4 now they already had a patent for the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.870 
4 now they already had a patent for the
playstation<00:05:14.750> 4<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.320> controller<00:05:16.220> that<00:05:16.340> splits

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
playstation 4 a controller that splits

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.730 
playstation 4 a controller that splits
in<00:05:17.000> half<00:05:17.030> it's<00:05:17.479> like<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.660> motion<00:05:18.260> controller

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
in half it's like a motion controller

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.710 
in half it's like a motion controller
and<00:05:19.100> I<00:05:19.639> don't<00:05:19.820> know<00:05:19.940> if<00:05:20.090> they<00:05:20.270> should've<00:05:20.630> did

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
and I don't know if they should've did

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.420 
and I don't know if they should've did
that<00:05:20.780> I<00:05:20.960> think<00:05:21.260> they<00:05:21.350> should<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.860> know<00:05:21.979> get

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
that I think they should you know get

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.580 
that I think they should you know get
away<00:05:22.550> from<00:05:22.729> motion<00:05:23.570> a<00:05:23.660> little<00:05:23.900> bit<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.260> didn't

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
away from motion a little bit I didn't

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.100 
away from motion a little bit I didn't
know<00:05:24.710> if<00:05:24.860> it's<00:05:25.039> really<00:05:25.280> working<00:05:25.520> well<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:26.690> don't

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
know if it's really working well I don't

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.110 
know if it's really working well I don't
use<00:05:27.320> motion<00:05:27.770> at<00:05:27.949> all<00:05:28.100> I<00:05:28.400> don't<00:05:28.699> know<00:05:28.820> anybody

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.120 
use motion at all I don't know anybody
that<00:05:29.449> does<00:05:29.660> I<00:05:29.840> mean<00:05:30.020> I'm<00:05:30.470> sure<00:05:30.710> there's<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:30.979> lot

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
that does I mean I'm sure there's a lot

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.190 
that does I mean I'm sure there's a lot
of<00:05:31.160> people<00:05:31.490> that<00:05:31.580> do<00:05:31.880> use<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.300> but<00:05:32.510> i<00:05:32.840> would

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
of people that do use it but i would

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.629 
of people that do use it but i would
probably<00:05:33.530> more<00:05:33.710> or<00:05:33.800> less<00:05:33.919> use<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.310> for<00:05:34.550> the

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
probably more or less use that for the

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.659

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
side it seems like they're going to

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.870 
side it seems like they're going to
change<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.570> name<00:05:53.599> to<00:05:53.780> Thebes<00:05:54.440> and<00:05:54.880> before

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
they are going to call it the Orbis so I

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.439 
they are going to call it the Orbis so I
don't<00:05:58.070> really<00:05:58.160> know<00:05:58.550> if<00:05:58.729> these<00:05:58.880> names<00:05:59.240> are

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449
