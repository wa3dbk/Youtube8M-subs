this<00:00:11.870> is<00:00:12.049> we<00:00:12.169> set<00:00:12.379> the<00:00:12.500> state<00:00:12.740> doubt<00:00:12.980> it's

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
this is we set the state doubt it's

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.630 
this is we set the state doubt it's
going<00:00:14.119> to<00:00:14.209> come<00:00:14.360> under<00:00:14.660> this<00:00:14.869> way<00:00:15.520> under<00:00:16.520> the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
going to come under this way under the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.999 
going to come under this way under the
body<00:00:16.880> and<00:00:17.330> then<00:00:17.840> back<00:00:18.109> out<00:00:18.349> into<00:00:18.619> a<00:00:18.770> regular

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
body and then back out into a regular

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.510 
body and then back out into a regular
push<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:20.509> area<00:00:20.989> in<00:00:21.169> here<00:00:21.369> these<00:00:22.369> are

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
push so this area in here these are

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.580 
push so this area in here these are
under<00:00:22.789> push<00:00:23.029> this<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.779> where<00:00:23.960> you<00:00:24.140> see<00:00:24.349> photo

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
under push this is where you see photo

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.409 
under push this is where you see photo
system<00:00:24.860> coordinates<00:00:25.400> this<00:00:25.610> is<00:00:26.000> where<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:26.239> see

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
system coordinates this is where you see

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.810 
system coordinates this is where you see
photos<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:26.869> skaters<00:00:27.379> in<00:00:27.410> this<00:00:27.680> position<00:00:28.160> then

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
photos of skaters in this position then

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.639 
photos of skaters in this position then
this<00:00:29.000> dennis<00:00:29.450> quaid<00:00:29.750> transfers<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.469> other

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
this dennis quaid transfers the other

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.380 
this dennis quaid transfers the other
way<00:00:30.770> back<00:00:30.980> out<00:00:31.219> and<00:00:31.730> this<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.210> beginning

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
way back out and this is the beginning

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.959 
way back out and this is the beginning
of<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.809> regular<00:00:33.200> push<00:00:33.579> now<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.640> thing<00:00:34.940> to

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
of the regular push now the thing to

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.880 
of the regular push now the thing to
understand<00:00:35.510> with<00:00:35.660> double<00:00:35.960> cushion<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.620> I

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
understand with double cushion is that I

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.389 
understand with double cushion is that I
think<00:00:37.789> of<00:00:38.149> it<00:00:38.270> as<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.450> volume<00:00:38.989> knob<00:00:39.160> rather<00:00:40.160> than

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
think of it as a volume knob rather than

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.569 
think of it as a volume knob rather than
one<00:00:40.969> two<00:00:41.360> or<00:00:41.480> three<00:00:41.719> settings<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.890> can<00:00:42.920> vary

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
one two or three settings you can vary

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.780 
one two or three settings you can vary
all<00:00:44.300> sorts<00:00:44.900> of<00:00:45.020> these<00:00:45.170> elements<00:00:45.790> depending<00:00:46.790> on

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
all sorts of these elements depending on

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.420 
all sorts of these elements depending on
how<00:00:47.030> fast<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.540> want<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.780> go<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:49.010> like<00:00:49.250> to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
how fast you want to go and I like to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.930 
how fast you want to go and I like to
use<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:50.140> 3d<00:00:51.140> model<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:52.340> would<00:00:52.520> be<00:00:52.550> sort<00:00:52.850> of

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
use a 3d model this would be sort of

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.210 
use a 3d model this would be sort of
gear<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:54.070> gear<00:00:55.070> number<00:00:55.430> one<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.940> very<00:00:56.270> subtle

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
gear to gear number one is very subtle

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.100 
gear to gear number one is very subtle
so<00:00:58.220> I<00:00:58.460> was<00:00:58.700> asked<00:00:59.090> do<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.270> double<00:00:59.660> push<00:00:59.870> all

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
so I was asked do you double push all

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.310 
so I was asked do you double push all
the<00:01:00.230> time<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.430> answer<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.790> yes<00:01:02.170> part<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
the time the answer is yes part of the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.859 
the time the answer is yes part of the
problem<00:01:03.500> is<00:01:03.800> people<00:01:04.009> associate<00:01:04.850> double<00:01:05.630> push

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
problem is people associate double push

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.060 
problem is people associate double push
with<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.560> extreme<00:01:07.270> under<00:01:08.270> push<00:01:08.509> position

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
with that extreme under push position

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.819 
with that extreme under push position
okay<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:10.759> if<00:01:10.820> I'm<00:01:11.060> just<00:01:11.299> going<00:01:11.540> slow<00:01:11.899> not<00:01:12.560> very

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
okay but if I'm just going slow not very

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.920 
okay but if I'm just going slow not very
much<00:01:12.920> bending<00:01:13.250> my<00:01:13.460> knees<00:01:13.700> I'm<00:01:14.210> setting<00:01:14.570> my<00:01:14.659> ski

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
much bending my knees I'm setting my ski

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.910 
much bending my knees I'm setting my ski
down<00:01:15.140> here

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
down here

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.800 
down here
I<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.549> have<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.820> little<00:01:17.030> under<00:01:17.360> push<00:01:18.100> okay

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
I just have this little under push okay

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.780 
I just have this little under push okay
this<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:20.960> still<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.500> same<00:01:21.790> mechanical

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
this is still the same mechanical

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.210 
this is still the same mechanical
characteristics<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.659> double<00:01:23.960> push<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.770> just

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
characteristics of double push is just

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.719 
characteristics of double push is just
on<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.700> small<00:01:26.090> scale<00:01:26.710> this<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:28.040> high<00:01:28.280> speed

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
on a small scale this is at high speed

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.660 
on a small scale this is at high speed
on<00:01:29.479> setting<00:01:29.869> my<00:01:29.990> skating<00:01:30.290> down<00:01:30.439> way<00:01:30.740> out<00:01:30.920> here

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
on setting my skating down way out here

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.040 
on setting my skating down way out here
big<00:01:32.970> under<00:01:33.390> plush

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.250 

okay<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.460> distance<00:01:39.820> here<00:01:40.260> becomes

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
okay so this distance here becomes

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.330 
okay so this distance here becomes
greater<00:01:42.120> smaller<00:01:43.120> even<00:01:43.870> smaller<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.620> the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
greater smaller even smaller and the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.280 
greater smaller even smaller and the
distance<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.940> your<00:01:46.000> under<00:01:46.360> question<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.140> get

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
distance of your under question and get

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.670 
distance of your under question and get
bigger<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.830> bigger<00:01:48.190> better<00:01:49.260> now<00:01:50.260> just<00:01:50.530> like

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
bigger and bigger better now just like

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.730 
bigger and bigger better now just like
yours<00:01:51.010> on<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.220> bicycle<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:53.020> gears<00:01:53.470> are

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
yours on a bicycle these gears are

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.710 
yours on a bicycle these gears are
associated<00:01:54.340> with<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.640> certain<00:01:55.120> range<00:01:55.420> of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
associated with a certain range of

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.440 
associated with a certain range of
speeds<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.680> zero<00:01:57.010> zero<00:01:57.730> kilometers<00:01:58.030> an

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
speeds this is zero zero kilometers an

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.880 
speeds this is zero zero kilometers an
hour<00:01:58.570> from<00:01:59.320> 0<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.860> about<00:01:59.890> 10<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:02.290> can't<00:02:02.650> really

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
hour from 0 to about 10 you can't really

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.320 
hour from 0 to about 10 you can't really
double<00:02:03.280> push<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.820> don't<00:02:04.000> have<00:02:04.180> enough

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
double push you just don't have enough

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.740 
double push you just don't have enough
speed<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.840> support<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.830> under<00:02:06.070> push

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
speed to support the under push

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.250 
speed to support the under push
everything<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.229> here<00:02:08.740> this<00:02:09.430> is<00:02:09.610> up<00:02:09.760> to<00:02:09.880> 7<00:02:10.510> 25

kilometers an hour

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.490 
kilometers an hour
you<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:13.720> see<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.110> sort<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
you would see this sort of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.830 
you would see this sort of
characteristic<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:16.740> acceleration<00:02:18.300> say<00:02:19.300> 40

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
bend the legs I'm going to go to this

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.400 
bend the legs I'm going to go to this
corner<00:04:04.379> under<00:04:05.379> push<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.700> then<00:04:06.849> reload
