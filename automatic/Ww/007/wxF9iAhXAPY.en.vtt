run into this little area where you came
up<00:00:21.590> here<00:00:23.320> on<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:25.779> steam<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.809> guess<00:00:27.200> you<00:00:27.500> flew<00:00:27.860> up

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
up here on the steam I guess you flew up

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.389 
up here on the steam I guess you flew up
here<00:00:28.040> and<00:00:28.399> then<00:00:28.520> you're<00:00:28.759> throwing<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.630> pot<00:00:29.930> of

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
here and then you're throwing the pot of

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.250 
here and then you're throwing the pot of
brambles<00:00:31.399> on<00:00:31.610> there<00:00:31.849> to<00:00:32.090> provide<00:00:32.899> even<00:00:33.079> more

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
brambles on there to provide even more

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.590 
brambles on there to provide even more
steam<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:34.700> you<00:00:34.850> could<00:00:35.030> reach<00:00:35.270> that

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
steam so that you could reach that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.500 
steam so that you could reach that
platform<00:00:36.260> up<00:00:36.410> there<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:37.820> what<00:00:38.059> we're<00:00:38.180> gonna<00:00:38.239> do

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
platform up there so what we're gonna do

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.529 
platform up there so what we're gonna do
again<00:00:39.170> this<00:00:39.289> part<00:00:39.620> like<00:00:40.300> near<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.329> beginning

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
again this part like near the beginning

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.950

of<00:00:42.760> yeah<00:00:43.760> near<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.060> beginning<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.450> Hades<00:00:44.810> I

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
of yeah near the beginning of Hades I

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.250 
of yeah near the beginning of Hades I
would<00:00:45.079> say<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:46.480> so<00:00:47.480> you're<00:00:47.630> gonna<00:00:47.720> pull<00:00:48.140> up

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
would say and so you're gonna pull up

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.840 
would say and so you're gonna pull up
pull<00:00:48.440> down<00:00:48.620> this<00:00:48.710> platform<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.310> climb<00:00:49.489> up<00:00:49.700> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
pull down this platform and climb up and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.280 
pull down this platform and climb up and
it's<00:00:49.970> pretty<00:00:50.150> obvious<00:00:50.570> where<00:00:50.720> this<00:00:50.810> room<00:00:51.079> is<00:00:51.260> I

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
it's pretty obvious where this room is I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.569 
it's pretty obvious where this room is I
mean<00:00:51.560> it's<00:00:51.680> got<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.829> glowy<00:00:52.100> thing<00:00:52.370> honestly

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
mean it's got a glowy thing honestly

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.130 
mean it's got a glowy thing honestly
probably<00:00:53.150> couldn't<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.630> missed<00:00:53.810> it<00:00:53.960> but

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
probably couldn't have missed it but

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.569 
probably couldn't have missed it but
whatever<00:00:54.320> just<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:54.800> case<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.100> did<00:00:55.280> because

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
whatever just in case you did because

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.580 
whatever just in case you did because
the<00:00:56.570> next<00:00:56.780> thing<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:56.960> need<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.140> do<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.440> don't

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
the next thing you need to do you don't

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.130 
the next thing you need to do you don't
really<00:00:57.710> have<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.010> get<00:00:58.340> into<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.670> room<00:00:59.140> you

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
really have to get into this room you

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.139 
really have to get into this room you
can<00:01:00.500> actually<00:01:00.770> float<00:01:01.160> up<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.610> next<00:01:01.790> level

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
can actually float up to the next level

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.030 
can actually float up to the next level
but<00:01:02.480> anyways<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.020> is<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.230> hand<00:01:03.530> room<00:01:03.770> and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
but anyways this is a hand room and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.340 
but anyways this is a hand room and
there's<00:01:04.250> all<00:01:04.460> kinds<00:01:04.939> of<00:01:05.030> these<00:01:05.239> hands<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's all kinds of these hands and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.990 
there's all kinds of these hands and
arms<00:01:06.530> coming<00:01:06.920> out<00:01:07.070> of<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.280> ground<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
arms coming out of the ground and the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.139 
arms coming out of the ground and the
ceiling<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.259> walls<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:10.149> assume

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
ceiling and the the walls and assume

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.459 
ceiling and the the walls and assume
that<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.390> didn't<00:01:11.570> have<00:01:11.689> our<00:01:11.719> nemesis<00:01:12.259> whip

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
that we didn't have our nemesis whip

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:13.990 
that we didn't have our nemesis whip
because<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.829> could<00:01:12.950> probably<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.340> would

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
because you could probably I would

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.480 
because you could probably I would
imagine<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.510> could<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.950> might<00:01:16.100> not<00:01:16.280> be<00:01:16.430> able

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
imagine you could you might not be able

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.219 
imagine you could you might not be able
to<00:01:16.610> get<00:01:16.700> your<00:01:16.850> thousand<00:01:17.390> hit<00:01:17.510> combo<00:01:17.870> in<00:01:17.990> here

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
to get your thousand hit combo in here

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.130 
to get your thousand hit combo in here
but<00:01:19.190> we<00:01:19.580> did<00:01:19.729> it<00:01:19.850> elsewhere<00:01:20.120> anyways<00:01:20.510> so<00:01:20.870> make

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
but we did it elsewhere anyways so make

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.289 
but we did it elsewhere anyways so make
sure<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.350> check<00:01:21.530> out<00:01:21.650> that<00:01:21.830> video<00:01:22.180> and<00:01:23.180> we're

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
a little bit we're gonna kill all the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.399 
a little bit we're gonna kill all the
arms<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.430> are<00:01:31.460> coming<00:01:31.729> out<00:01:32.200> don't<00:01:33.200> let<00:01:33.320> them

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
arms that are coming out don't let them

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.600 
arms that are coming out don't let them
grab<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.799> I<00:01:33.830> don't<00:01:33.950> know<00:01:34.100> what<00:01:34.220> happens<00:01:34.520> if

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
grab you I don't know what happens if

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.420 
grab you I don't know what happens if
they<00:01:34.729> grab<00:01:34.940> you<00:01:35.799> they<00:01:36.799> they<00:01:36.830> pull<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.310> into

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
they grab you they they pull you into

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.149 
they grab you they they pull you into
the<00:01:37.610> wall<00:01:37.790> who<00:01:38.090> knows<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.630> think<00:01:39.080> they<00:01:39.380> just<00:01:39.409> do

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
the wall who knows I think they just do

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.510 
the wall who knows I think they just do
a<00:01:40.189> little<00:01:40.430> damage<00:01:40.610> on<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.150> that's<00:01:41.810> it

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
a little damage on you that's it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.210 
a little damage on you that's it
there's<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.610> lot<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:43.880> hands<00:01:44.060> though<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.220> it's

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
there's a lot of hands though but it's

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.179 
there's a lot of hands though but it's
actually<00:01:46.580> probably<00:01:47.060> good<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.479> go<00:01:47.570> through<00:01:48.189> to

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
actually probably good to go through to

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.130 
actually probably good to go through to
go<00:01:49.310> through<00:01:49.580> here<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:50.270> because<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.780> do<00:01:50.900> get

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
go through here just because you do get

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.310 
go through here just because you do get
a<00:01:51.170> ton<00:01:51.409> of<00:01:51.439> XP<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.890> think<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:53.810> close<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.290> a

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
a ton of XP I think of this close to a
