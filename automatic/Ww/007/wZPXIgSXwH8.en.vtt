00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
cami has a problem against records
because<00:01:39.869> she<00:01:39.990> can't<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.560> jump<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.920> when

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
because she can't you to jump but when

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
because she can't you to jump but when
she<00:01:41.159> gets<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> corner<00:01:41.700> she<00:01:42.060> actually

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
she gets in the corner she actually

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
she gets in the corner she actually
gains<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> extra<00:01:43.649> tool<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.280> she<00:01:44.430> could

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
gains that extra tool because she could

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
gains that extra tool because she could
jump<00:01:44.790> backwards<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> act<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
jump backwards and have it act like a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
jump backwards and have it act like a
neutral<00:01:47.100> jungle<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.850> actually

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
neutral jungle so it's actually

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.450 
neutral jungle so it's actually
sometimes<00:01:48.750> an<00:01:49.110> advantageous<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:50.040> her<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> get

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
sometimes an advantageous for her to get

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
sometimes an advantageous for her to get
into<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.850> position<00:01:51.350> anything<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.470> changes

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
into that position anything that changes

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
into that position anything that changes
your<00:01:52.950> jump<00:01:53.220> trajectory<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.210> definitely

your jump trajectory is is definitely

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.940 
your jump trajectory is is definitely

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.540 
I'm wrong I was like flockers about the
step<00:06:21.880> up<00:06:22.060> okay<00:06:22.860> looks<00:06:23.860> like<00:06:23.919> he's<00:06:24.100> gonna<00:06:24.190> go<00:06:24.430> up

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
step up okay looks like he's gonna go up

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.290 
step up okay looks like he's gonna go up
against<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.120> CJ<00:06:25.810> truth<00:06:26.080> oh<00:06:26.290> I<00:06:26.740> see<00:06:27.040> same<00:06:28.030> pool

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
against the CJ truth oh I see same pool

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.240 
against the CJ truth oh I see same pool
huh<00:06:28.510> so<00:06:28.720> I<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.140> I'm<00:06:29.320> assuming<00:06:29.770> now<00:06:30.010> is<00:06:30.160> the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
huh so I and so I'm assuming now is the

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.530 
huh so I and so I'm assuming now is the
winners<00:06:30.490> final<00:06:30.850> of<00:06:31.000> the<00:06:31.150> pool

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
winners final of the pool

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.970 
winners final of the pool
I<00:06:31.570> would<00:06:31.840> guess<00:06:32.020> so<00:06:32.230> yeah<00:06:32.440> it<00:06:32.590> looks<00:06:32.740> like<00:06:32.770> this

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
I would guess so yeah it looks like this

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.500 
I would guess so yeah it looks like this
is<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:33.220> losers<00:06:33.490> final<00:06:33.880> that<00:06:34.180> must<00:06:34.390> mean

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
is the losers final that must mean

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.710 
is the losers final that must mean
tyranny<00:06:35.080> has<00:06:35.140> qualified
