00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.639 
sure it doesn't Brown up too much okay
so<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:42.930> taking<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> oven

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so I'm just taking this out of the oven

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.530 
so I'm just taking this out of the oven
now<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.310> still<00:01:44.610> pretty<00:01:44.759> hot<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.240> let<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
now it's still pretty hot so we let it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.969 
now it's still pretty hot so we let it
cool<00:01:45.689> down<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.899> about<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.380> half<00:01:46.439> an<00:01:46.860> hour

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
cool down for about a good half an hour

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100

then<00:01:47.310> it'll<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> ready<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> cut<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.210> okay<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
then it'll be ready to cut up okay so

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.450 
then it'll be ready to cut up okay so
just<00:01:49.409> cut<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.100> they'll<00:01:50.189> come<00:01:50.369> out

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
are darker than normal flapjacks for the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.859 
are darker than normal flapjacks for the
simple<00:01:55.320> reason<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:56.009> brown<00:01:56.340> sugar<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.119> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
simple reason is I use brown sugar and I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380 
simple reason is I use brown sugar and I
also<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.469> golden<00:01:58.950> syrup<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.210> more

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
also use golden syrup the more

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990 
also use golden syrup the more
traditional<00:02:00.869> recipe<00:02:01.200> uses<00:02:01.770> corn<00:02:02.610> syrup

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
better uses white sugar but honestly

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.639
