Boxing<00:01:05.360> Day<00:01:05.390> last<00:01:05.690> year<00:01:05.840> with<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.470> view<00:01:06.650> decay

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
Boxing Day last year with a view decay

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.760 
Boxing Day last year with a view decay
and<00:01:07.990> what<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.020> thought<00:01:09.230> would<00:01:09.350> be<00:01:09.410> just<00:01:09.710> an<00:01:09.830> easy

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
and what I thought would be just an easy

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.200 
and what I thought would be just an easy
easy<00:01:12.770> time<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.370> get<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.550> car<00:01:13.700> running<00:01:13.880> it's

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
easy time to get the car running it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.360 
easy time to get the car running it's
just<00:01:14.480> nearly<00:01:15.350> four<00:01:15.590> months<00:01:15.770> now<00:01:16.010> just

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
just nearly four months now just

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.250 
just nearly four months now just
debugging<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.450> finding<00:01:17.840> all<00:01:17.960> these<00:01:18.080> little

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
debugging and finding all these little

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.670 
debugging and finding all these little
gremlins<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:18.920> I'm<00:01:19.150> finally<00:01:20.150> today<00:01:20.660> 689<00:01:21.410> and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
gremlins so I'm finally today 689 and

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.640 
gremlins so I'm finally today 689 and
still<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.130> little<00:01:22.370> bit<00:01:25.420> problematic<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
still a little bit problematic the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.350 
still a little bit problematic the
shoots<00:01:27.860> didn't<00:01:28.160> come<00:01:28.310> out<00:01:28.340> until<00:01:28.610> well<00:01:29.060> only

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
shoots didn't come out until well only

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.880 
shoots didn't come out until well only
one<00:01:29.509> parachute<00:01:29.840> came<00:01:30.050> out<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.740> didn't

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
one parachute came out and I didn't

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.170 
one parachute came out and I didn't
deploy<00:01:31.100> fully<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.700> other<00:01:31.790> one<00:01:31.940> didn't

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
deploy fully and the other one didn't

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.090 
deploy fully and the other one didn't
and<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.930> car<00:01:33.140> just<00:01:33.380> wasn't<00:01:33.650> going<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.830> pull<00:01:33.979> up

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
and the car just wasn't going to pull up

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.530 
and the car just wasn't going to pull up
and<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.460> safest<00:01:34.790> thing<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:34.940> do<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.210> just<00:01:35.240> to

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
and the safest thing to do is just to

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.300 
and the safest thing to do is just to
put<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.750> in<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.869> sand<00:01:36.080> which<00:01:36.350> we<00:01:36.590> did<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.979> little

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
put it in the sand which we did a little

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.040 
put it in the sand which we did a little
bit<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.460> superficial<00:01:37.820> damage<00:01:38.119> Mindi's<00:01:38.990> a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
bit of superficial damage Mindi's a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.570 
bit of superficial damage Mindi's a
little<00:01:39.320> bit<00:01:39.410> dirty<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.860> think<00:01:40.130> apart<00:01:40.460> from

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
little bit dirty but I think apart from

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.540 
little bit dirty but I think apart from
that<00:01:40.610> all<00:01:40.880> good<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.900> was<00:01:42.259> a<00:01:42.290> shakedown<00:01:42.950> for

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
that all good it was a shakedown for

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.020 
that all good it was a shakedown for
today<00:01:44.020> we<00:01:45.020> had<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.530> very<00:01:46.400> similar<00:01:46.580> setup<00:01:46.970> to

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
today we had a very similar setup to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.219 
today we had a very similar setup to
what<00:01:47.150> we<00:01:47.240> use<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.570> MX<00:01:47.810> six<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.170> we

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
what we use in the MX six and we

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.170 
what we use in the MX six and we
expected<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:48.950> kind<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.280> times<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.729> we've

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
expected these kind of times but we've

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.510 
expected these kind of times but we've
expected<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.869> do<00:01:51.290> this<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:52.040> last<00:01:52.220> four<00:01:52.430> or

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
expected to do this the last four or

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.040 
expected to do this the last four or
five<00:01:52.550> months<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.660> hasn't<00:01:53.930> come<00:01:53.990> up

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
five months and and it hasn't come up

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.540 
five months and and it hasn't come up
for<00:01:54.259> whatever<00:01:54.530> reason<00:01:54.830> but<00:01:54.950> today<00:01:55.160> we<00:01:55.340> sort<00:01:55.520> of

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
for whatever reason but today we sort of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.889 
for whatever reason but today we sort of
had<00:01:55.700> everything<00:01:55.910> sorted<00:01:56.270> out<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.690> was<00:01:56.720> all

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
had everything sorted out and it was all

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.560 
had everything sorted out and it was all
good<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.770> car<00:01:57.950> used<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.280> run<00:01:58.399> six<00:01:58.670> 50s<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.210> 60s

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
good the car used to run six 50s and 60s

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.649 
good the car used to run six 50s and 60s
in<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.810> US<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:01.220> think<00:02:02.000> we<00:02:02.150> make<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.360> little

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
in the US and I think we make a little

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.240 
in the US and I think we make a little
bit<00:02:02.780> more<00:02:02.930> power<00:02:03.110> or<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.409> same<00:02:03.800> kind<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.100> power

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
bit more power or the same kind of power

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.800 
bit more power or the same kind of power
that<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.490> press<00:02:04.700> up<00:02:04.880> guys<00:02:05.030> are<00:02:05.210> doing<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:05.570> I

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
that the press up guys are doing so I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.630 
that the press up guys are doing so I
would<00:02:06.740> definitely<00:02:06.950> like<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.310> see<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.610> car

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
would definitely like to see the car

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.210 
would definitely like to see the car
running<00:02:08.119> below<00:02:08.390> 60<00:02:08.810> 60<00:02:09.110> s<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.260> 650s<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:10.040> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
running below 60 60 s I 650s in the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.130 
running below 60 60 s I 650s in the
not-too-distant<00:02:10.580> future<00:02:10.940> gem<00:02:11.720> berries<00:02:11.989> are

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
not-too-distant future gem berries are

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.440 
not-too-distant future gem berries are
probably<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.830> highlight<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.790> our<00:02:14.060> racing

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
probably the highlight of our racing

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.410 
probably the highlight of our racing
calendar<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:14.989> arm<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.820> would<00:02:16.820> dearly<00:02:17.000> love<00:02:17.239> for

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
calendar so arm I would dearly love for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.120 
calendar so arm I would dearly love for
it<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.690> real<00:02:17.930> fast<00:02:18.080> at<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.410> jamboree<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.010> I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
it to be real fast at the jamboree but I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.500 
it to be real fast at the jamboree but I
mean<00:02:19.340> we're<00:02:19.700> going<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:20.000> take<00:02:20.150> baby<00:02:20.420> steps

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
mean we're going to just take baby steps

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.410 
mean we're going to just take baby steps
and<00:02:21.250> hopefully<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.400> back<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:22.970> up<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and hopefully just back that up and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.000 
and hopefully just back that up and
maybe<00:02:23.540> go<00:02:23.660> they'll<00:02:23.900> be<00:02:23.989> faster<00:02:24.350> but<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.650> never

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
maybe go they'll be faster but you never

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.229 
maybe go they'll be faster but you never
know<00:02:25.160> what<00:02:25.280> happens<00:02:25.519> in<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> spirit<00:02:26.209> of

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239
