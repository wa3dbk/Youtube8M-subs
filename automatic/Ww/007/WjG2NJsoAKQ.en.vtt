stripes and spots surrounded by distinct

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.570 
stripes and spots surrounded by distinct
areas<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.420> green<00:00:15.660> if<00:00:15.949> we<00:00:16.949> allow<00:00:17.160> these<00:00:17.340> two

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
areas of green if we allow these two

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
areas of green if we allow these two
colors<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.119> mix<00:00:18.300> either<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.869> our<00:00:18.990> palette<00:00:19.380> or

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
colors to mix either in our palette or

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
colors to mix either in our palette or
on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> paper<00:00:20.130> we'll<00:00:20.820> end<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:21.180> brown

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
on the paper we'll end up with brown

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.170 
on the paper we'll end up with brown
which<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.109> don't<00:00:22.350> want<00:00:22.730> here's<00:00:23.730> how<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> tackle

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
which we don't want here's how I tackle

undesirable visual mix or brown then I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
undesirable visual mix or brown then I
use<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.660> green<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> yellow

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
use my green with some of the yellow

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.549 
use my green with some of the yellow
ochre<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.059> thicker<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.930> build<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
ochre in it thicker to build up the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
ochre in it thicker to build up the
green<00:00:49.770> mid-tones<00:00:50.340> leaving<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> red<00:00:51.480> stripes

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
green mid-tones leaving the red stripes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.939 
green mid-tones leaving the red stripes
as<00:00:52.110> gaps

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.700 

once<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.850> dry<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.179> build<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.109> ready<00:01:01.350> Brown

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
once it's dry I build up a ready Brown

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.060 
once it's dry I build up a ready Brown
nix<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.579> areas<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.269> color<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.070> then

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
nix on the areas of that color I then

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
nix on the areas of that color I then
use<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.519> red<00:01:05.790> mixture<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:07.020> most<00:01:07.229> red

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
use my red mixture on the most red

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.889 
use my red mixture on the most red
stripes<00:01:07.920> creating<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> dots<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> lines<00:01:09.420> with

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
stripes creating the dots and lines with

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.810 
stripes creating the dots and lines with
my<00:01:10.049> brush<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> feature<00:01:11.399> of<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
my brush that are a feature of the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.969 
my brush that are a feature of the
pattern

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.029 

now<00:01:18.789> that<00:01:19.030> my<00:01:19.180> red<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.659> down<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.200> can<00:01:20.710> see<00:01:20.920> that

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
now that my red is down I can see that

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.480 
now that my red is down I can see that
my<00:01:21.189> greens<00:01:21.549> need<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.969> be<00:01:22.060> darker<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:24.189> with<00:01:24.369> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
my greens need to be darker so with the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.760 
my greens need to be darker so with the
red<00:01:24.729> now<00:01:24.969> dry<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:25.539> build<00:01:25.869> up<00:01:26.020> my<00:01:26.200> greens<00:01:26.530> around

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
red now dry I build up my greens around

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.990 
red now dry I build up my greens around
them<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:29.020> help<00:01:29.229> unify<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.799> apple<00:01:30.280> skin<00:01:30.579> and<00:01:30.880> to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
them to help unify the apple skin and to

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.060 
them to help unify the apple skin and to
get<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.270> overall<00:01:31.840> color<00:01:32.200> looking<00:01:32.560> right<00:01:32.799> I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
get the overall color looking right I

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.550 
get the overall color looking right I
now<00:01:33.610> use<00:01:33.909> neat<00:01:34.240> yellow<00:01:34.600> ochre<00:01:34.960> over<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.380> red

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
now use neat yellow ochre over the red

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.130 
now use neat yellow ochre over the red
and<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.069> green<00:01:36.159> areas<00:01:36.670> again<00:01:37.179> this<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.960> done

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
and the green areas again this is done

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.130 
and the green areas again this is done
while<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.619> layer<00:01:38.829> underneath<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.579> dry<00:01:40.140> only

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
while the layer underneath is dry only

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.080 
while the layer underneath is dry only
now<00:01:41.530> I'm<00:01:41.710> more<00:01:41.920> confident<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.640> these<00:01:42.819> green

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
now I'm more confident that these green

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120 
now I'm more confident that these green
and<00:01:43.149> red<00:01:43.479> mid-tones<00:01:44.200> are<00:01:44.439> as<00:01:44.530> dark<00:01:44.740> as<00:01:44.979> they

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
and red mid-tones are as dark as they

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.459 
and red mid-tones are as dark as they
should<00:01:45.189> be<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.119> go<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.539> with<00:01:46.569> my<00:01:46.719> darkest

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
should be so I go in with my darkest

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.190 
should be so I go in with my darkest
Reds<00:01:47.740> once<00:01:48.549> this<00:01:48.850> dark<00:01:49.179> red<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.600> down<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.049> will

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
Reds once this dark red is down it will

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.169 
Reds once this dark red is down it will
be<00:01:50.229> harder<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:50.740> work<00:01:51.039> around<00:01:51.429> it<00:01:51.640> without<00:01:51.909> it

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
be harder to work around it without it

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.960 
be harder to work around it without it
leading<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.830> appearance<00:01:54.399> of<00:01:54.520> color<00:01:54.789> is

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
leading the appearance of color is

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.300 
leading the appearance of color is
relative<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.049> when<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.259> do<00:01:56.409> lay<00:01:56.860> down<00:01:57.159> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
relative so that when I do lay down the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.399 
relative so that when I do lay down the
red<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:58.000> becomes<00:01:58.450> clear<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.840> me<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.140> my

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
red it becomes clear to me that my

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.770 
red it becomes clear to me that my
greens<00:01:59.740> are<00:01:59.979> too<00:02:00.220> green<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.970> need<00:02:01.390> some<00:02:01.630> more

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
greens are too green and need some more

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.690 
greens are too green and need some more
yellow<00:02:01.990> ochre<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.500> top<00:02:02.739> of<00:02:02.890> them<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.250> bring

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
yellow ochre on top of them to bring

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.889 
yellow ochre on top of them to bring
them<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.539> right<00:02:04.750> kind<00:02:04.989> of<00:02:05.140> color

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.900 

now<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.929> can<00:02:09.289> go<00:02:09.410> back<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.679> my<00:02:09.950> dark<00:02:10.190> Reds<00:02:10.550> again

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
now I can go back to my dark Reds again

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.680 
now I can go back to my dark Reds again
and<00:02:11.150> add<00:02:11.270> some<00:02:11.480> more<00:02:11.660> detail<00:02:13.239> lots<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.510> lots
