00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you can see here that it's in the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810 
you can see here that it's in the
blanche<00:00:43.260> let's<00:00:43.950> turn<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.190> around<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.640> way

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
blanche let's turn that around that way

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
blanche let's turn that around that way
you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:47.719> it<00:00:48.719> didn't<00:00:49.020> latch<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.500> how

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
you can see that it didn't latch see how

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.350 
you can see that it didn't latch see how
it's<00:00:49.710> bumping<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.550> against<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.180> didn't

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's bumping up against that and didn't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.459 
it's bumping up against that and didn't
close<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:53.219> way<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:57.440> we<00:00:58.440> want

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
close all the way like that so we want

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.970 
close all the way like that so we want
to<00:00:58.680> fix<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.280> how<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.329> well

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
to fix that now how do we do that well

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.750 
to fix that now how do we do that well
most<00:01:01.980> screen<00:01:02.520> doors<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.120> what's<00:01:03.690> called<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
most screen doors have what's called a

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.240 
most screen doors have what's called a
closer

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.550 

right<00:01:13.910> there<00:01:14.210> that's<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.900> closer<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.990> has

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
right there that's the closer and it has

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.150 
right there that's the closer and it has
air<00:01:19.070> or<00:01:19.790> fluid<00:01:20.060> or<00:01:20.420> something<00:01:21.320> inside<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.100> it

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
air or fluid or something inside of it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.100 
air or fluid or something inside of it
maybe<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.910> combination<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.690> both<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:26.110> there's

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
maybe a combination of both and there's

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.410 
maybe a combination of both and there's
a<00:01:27.200> valve<00:01:28.690> right<00:01:29.690> here<00:01:30.550> can<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.700> can<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.390> see

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
a valve right here can you can you see

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.670 
a valve right here can you can you see
that<00:01:33.340> there's<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.460> valve<00:01:34.700> right<00:01:35.330> there<00:01:35.680> that

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
that there's a valve right there that

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.070 
that there's a valve right there that
controls<00:01:37.130> how<00:01:37.340> fast<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:39.470> air<00:01:39.650> comes<00:01:40.460> out<00:01:41.080> so

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
controls how fast the air comes out so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.560 
controls how fast the air comes out so

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
I'm just going to I'm going to take that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.920 
I'm just going to I'm going to take that
little<00:01:44.990> valve<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.970> I'm<00:01:47.180> just<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.510> turn

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
little valve and I'm just going to turn

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.600 
little valve and I'm just going to turn
it<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.229> might<00:01:48.350> need<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.530> screwdriver<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.340> do<00:01:49.460> it

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
it you might need a screwdriver to do it

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.190 
it you might need a screwdriver to do it
I'm<00:01:50.300> going<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.630> turn<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.369> counterclockwise

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
I'm going to turn it counterclockwise

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.290 
I'm going to turn it counterclockwise
why<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.440> couple<00:01:54.710> turns<00:01:54.970> remember<00:01:55.970> how<00:01:56.090> far

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
why it's a couple turns remember how far
