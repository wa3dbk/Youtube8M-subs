you'll know exactly what size it is I
don't<00:02:54.530> think<00:02:54.650> it's<00:02:54.890> any<00:02:55.130> bigger<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.640> only

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
don't think it's any bigger the only

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.390 
don't think it's any bigger the only
main<00:02:56.150> difference<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.110> awesome<00:02:57.500> Triforce

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
main difference is this awesome Triforce

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.820 
main difference is this awesome Triforce
kind<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.850> logo<00:02:59.030> that's<00:02:59.510> it's<00:03:00.110> gold<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
kind of logo that's it's gold on the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.610 
kind of logo that's it's gold on the
front<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:01.340> darker<00:03:01.790> gold<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:03.230> logo

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
front and then darker gold on the logo

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.070 
front and then darker gold on the logo
there's<00:03:04.100> no<00:03:04.250> kind<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:04.910> real<00:03:05.150> feel<00:03:05.720> of

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
there's no kind of real feel of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.530 
there's no kind of real feel of
different<00:03:06.769> finish<00:03:07.160> on<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:07.579> but<00:03:08.180> it's<00:03:08.450> a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
different finish on there but it's a

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.050 
different finish on there but it's a
very<00:03:09.079> cool<00:03:09.320> design<00:03:09.500> anyway<00:03:10.040> let<00:03:10.700> me<00:03:10.730> quickly

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
very cool design anyway let me quickly

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.060 
very cool design anyway let me quickly

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
there is also a black Triforce on the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.789 
there is also a black Triforce on the
back<00:03:16.430> along<00:03:16.790> with<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> barcodes<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.870> all<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
technical stuff now let me give this

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.620 
technical stuff now let me give this
open<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.859> was<00:03:22.010> check<00:03:22.430> out<00:03:22.609> how<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.209> looks<00:03:23.390> on

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
open and was check out how it looks on

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.170 
open and was check out how it looks on
the<00:03:23.989> inside<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.500> yeah<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.549> see<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.850> in

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the inside and yeah you can see it in

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.009 
the inside and yeah you can see it in
all<00:03:26.299> its<00:03:26.329> glory<00:03:26.510> here<00:03:27.940> pretty<00:03:28.940> much<00:03:29.150> exactly

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
all its glory here pretty much exactly

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.140 
all its glory here pretty much exactly
up<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.290> 3d<00:03:30.620> s<00:03:30.709> itself<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.670> only<00:03:31.880> real

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
up to 3d s itself the only real

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.180 
up to 3d s itself the only real
difference<00:03:32.359> being<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.109> paint<00:03:33.410> work<00:03:33.650> let's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
difference being the paint work let's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.670 
difference being the paint work let's
just<00:03:34.430> quickly<00:03:34.820> compare<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.750> size<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.440> a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
just quickly compare the size to a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.030 
just quickly compare the size to a
normal<00:03:37.519> small<00:03:38.299> 3d<00:03:38.780> s<00:03:38.989> there<00:03:39.290> you're<00:03:39.769> gonna<00:03:39.859> get

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
normal small 3d s there you're gonna get

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.340 
normal small 3d s there you're gonna get
a<00:03:40.100> lot<00:03:40.280> more<00:03:40.340> 3d<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.390> your<00:03:41.510> money<00:03:41.720> that's<00:03:42.049> for

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
a lot more 3d for your money that's for

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.930 
a lot more 3d for your money that's for
sure<00:03:42.560> with<00:03:42.769> this<00:03:42.920> on<00:03:43.130> I'm<00:03:43.400> gonna<00:03:43.519> turn<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.850> on

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
sure with this on I'm gonna turn it on

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.979 
sure with this on I'm gonna turn it on
quickly<00:03:44.239> just<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:45.049> see<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:45.470> boot<00:03:45.829> up

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.030 

come<00:03:50.989> on

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.649 

there<00:03:55.040> he<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:57.129> and<00:03:58.129> again<00:03:58.700> it's<00:03:59.000> exactly<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
there he is and again it's exactly the

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.550 
there he is and again it's exactly the
same<00:03:59.870> as<00:04:00.170> you'd<00:04:00.829> get<00:04:01.069> from<00:04:01.340> any<00:04:01.610> 3ds<00:04:02.560> exactly

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
same as you'd get from any 3ds exactly

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.289 
same as you'd get from any 3ds exactly
the<00:04:03.650> same<00:04:03.860> content<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.640> only<00:04:05.000> real

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
the same content the only real

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.479 
the same content the only real
difference<00:04:05.510> being<00:04:05.989> that<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.260> get<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.920> link

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
difference being that you get a link

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.789 
difference being that you get a link
between<00:04:07.700> worlds<00:04:08.090> with<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.599> which<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.409> was

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799
