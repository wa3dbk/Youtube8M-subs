now
every<00:01:44.720> single<00:01:45.260> building<00:01:45.560> has<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.070> policy

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
every single building has a policy

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.390 
every single building has a policy
against<00:01:47.479> bicycle<00:01:48.080> right<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
against bicycle right now that the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.700 
against bicycle right now that the
