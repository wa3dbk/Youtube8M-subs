 I need to attract attention 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.220
 student communities 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.900
 and not just for their cars in 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.950
 run longer 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.460
 also how to chat with friends 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.910
 must do imagine all this 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.830
 possibly 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.950
 need to translate all converge in mode 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.570
 online 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.610

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.800
 equals left alone with the goalkeeper 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.220
 recognized i know 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.250
 in places 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 a million dollars they don't have 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.479

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300
 experts 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 this category of complexity 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.400
 Generally if I did this data for 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.810
 May 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 attitude he could kill all on nothing 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190
 works 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.510
 I'm alone 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.290
 it all depends on the outcome 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 all the time has come 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 security she 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 600 million dollars 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 as for the charges 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.860
