to my SD card here so I'm going to go

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.020 
to my SD card here so I'm going to go
and<00:01:17.899> head<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.259> reboot<00:01:18.679> I<00:01:18.860> did<00:01:19.069> back<00:01:19.609> up<00:01:19.789> all<00:01:19.939> my

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
and head and reboot I did back up all my

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.789 
and head and reboot I did back up all my
data<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.990> I'm<00:01:21.259> gonna<00:01:21.350> go<00:01:21.469> ahead<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.649> reboot

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
data so I'm gonna go ahead and reboot

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.289 
data so I'm gonna go ahead and reboot
and<00:01:23.140> see<00:01:24.140> how<00:01:24.579> how<00:01:25.579> if<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:25.939> works<00:01:26.119> or<00:01:26.240> not

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
and see how how if it works or not

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.929 
and see how how if it works or not
hopefully<00:01:27.200> does<00:01:27.409> because<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:28.100> spend<00:01:28.429> I<00:01:28.490> sent

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
hopefully does because I spend I sent

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.059 
hopefully does because I spend I sent
like<00:01:29.090> 20<00:01:29.630> minutes<00:01:29.810> putting<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.500> on<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:30.829> 10

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
like 20 minutes putting it on like 10

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.740 
like 20 minutes putting it on like 10
minutes<00:01:31.250> putting<00:01:31.459> on<00:01:31.610> 10<00:01:31.909> min<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.119> verify<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
minutes putting on 10 min to verify the

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.499 
minutes putting on 10 min to verify the
data<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.500> hopefully<00:01:33.799> what<00:01:33.979> does<00:01:34.130> work<00:01:34.369> I<00:01:34.610> think

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
data so hopefully what does work I think

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.529 
data so hopefully what does work I think
you<00:01:35.569> see<00:01:35.689> it's<00:01:35.810> off<00:01:35.959> and<00:01:36.439> 0<00:01:37.280> as<00:01:37.549> you<00:01:37.670> can<00:01:37.789> see<00:01:37.970> if

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
or loaded the install screen much faster

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.680 
or loaded the install screen much faster
than<00:02:30.190> before<00:02:30.310> i<00:02:30.730> remember<00:02:31.300> i<00:02:31.330> weigh<00:02:31.510> at<00:02:31.660> least

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
like five minutes before with using the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.420 
like five minutes before with using the
external<00:02:34.480> USB<00:02:34.630> Drive<00:02:35.020> or<00:02:35.260> maybe<00:02:35.740> my<00:02:35.890> USB<00:02:36.220> Drive

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.699 

so<00:03:35.409> it<00:03:35.680> finished<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:37.629> know<00:03:37.750> installing<00:03:38.290> and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
so it finished you know installing and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.089 
so it finished you know installing and
booting<00:03:39.370> up<00:03:39.430> right<00:03:39.580> now<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:41.560> seems<00:03:41.739> much

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
booting up right now it seems much

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.330 
booting up right now it seems much
faster<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.120> on<00:03:43.209> SSD<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.900> mean<00:03:44.110> SD<00:03:44.680> card<00:03:45.069> or

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
faster to do it on SSD I mean SD card or

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.339 
faster to do it on SSD I mean SD card or
you<00:03:45.790> know<00:03:45.909> then<00:03:46.269> if<00:03:46.599> you<00:03:46.750> do<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.049> on<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:47.319> a

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
you know then if you do it on like a

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.470 
you know then if you do it on like a
external<00:03:47.980> hard<00:03:48.250> drive<00:03:48.430> mainly<00:03:49.180> because<00:03:49.209> I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
external hard drive mainly because I

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.910 
external hard drive mainly because I
believe<00:03:49.840> I'm<00:03:50.260> not<00:03:50.440> sure<00:03:50.620> about<00:03:50.769> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
believe I'm not sure about the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
believe I'm not sure about the
blueprints<00:03:51.370> by<00:03:51.459> believe<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.299> SD<00:03:52.840> card<00:03:52.930> slot

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
blueprints by believe the SD card slot

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.660 
blueprints by believe the SD card slot
holds<00:03:54.940> more<00:03:55.540> higher<00:03:56.170> priority<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.310> CPU

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
holds more higher priority to the CPU

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
holds more higher priority to the CPU
then<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.480> USB<00:03:58.810> USB<00:03:59.560> bus<00:04:00.370> does<00:04:00.610> and<00:04:00.819> this<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.660> a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
then the USB USB bus does and this is a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.400 
then the USB USB bus does and this is a
separate<00:04:02.019> bus<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.700> uh<00:04:03.730> if<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.840> don't<00:04:05.019> don't

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
separate bus so uh if you don't don't

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.600 
separate bus so uh if you don't don't
know<00:04:05.530> what<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.769> means<00:04:05.950> that's<00:04:06.099> fine<00:04:06.310> but<00:04:06.549> I'm

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
know what that means that's fine but I'm

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.460 
know what that means that's fine but I'm
just<00:04:06.819> saying<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.629> think<00:04:07.660> that's<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.170> card

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
just saying that I think that's the card

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.800 
just saying that I think that's the card
it's<00:04:09.190> not<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.400> some<00:04:09.700> cheapo<00:04:10.060> think<00:04:10.690> they

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
it's not just some cheapo think they

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.479 
it's not just some cheapo think they
just<00:04:10.959> added<00:04:11.079> in<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.379> last<00:04:11.620> minute<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.400> a

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
just added in the last minute it's a

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.640 
just added in the last minute it's a
really<00:04:12.670> good<00:04:12.819> top-quality<00:04:13.299> SD<00:04:13.959> card<00:04:14.200> slot<00:04:14.410> so

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
really good top-quality SD card slot so

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.379 
really good top-quality SD card slot so
it's<00:04:15.250> Britney<00:04:15.489> up<00:04:15.579> right<00:04:15.730> now<00:04:15.849> and<00:04:16.090> it's<00:04:16.299> going

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
it's Britney up right now and it's going

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.779 
it's Britney up right now and it's going
to<00:04:16.449> go<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> installer<00:04:17.049> um<00:04:17.489> not<00:04:18.489> sure<00:04:18.549> if<00:04:18.699> I

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
to go to the installer um not sure if I

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:19.860 
to go to the installer um not sure if I
should<00:04:18.820> wait<00:04:19.120> because<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.539> might<00:04:19.660> take<00:04:19.840> a
