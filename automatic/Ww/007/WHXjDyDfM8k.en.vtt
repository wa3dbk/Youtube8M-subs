00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.390
 Easter egg in black ops I dice 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:05.569
 need to find a computer to keep water 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.109
 computer sit at the computer and here and 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.579
 here , firstly, they will give you an achievement 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.549
 they are here 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.250
 to open an extra card in 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.560
 zombie mode 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.599
 I can not disclose because it 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.500
 violates the rights and xbox as well, that the most 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.870
 games but not the essence here is a single game and here 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150
 I'll finish a dead hero I won't even though no I 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.750
 I will demonstrate this card literally on 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.109
 a couple 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.630
 This is not such a cool mode in reality. 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.050
 business 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:45.870
 I don’t like them in principle and it’s the essence 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.670
 small counts well only in 2d 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.830
 well, or somehow, I don't know how it is 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.440
 to name 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.070
 Essentially in him such this as here 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:01.590
 some kind of machine that used to be 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:05.480
 slot machines and this one 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:14.600
 dead hero mode is about the same 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:14.600
 here we are now this green. 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.630
 So 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.389
 running hair and have a tough die 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.000

 this is the right joystick that you 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.680
 turn the screen 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.630
 then leave as usual to run here in 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.740
 In general, you can run here like jerks 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.100
 somehow you can spend this started staring 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.720
