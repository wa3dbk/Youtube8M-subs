00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.300
 Is there an end to history? 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.740
 While most people see history as a record of past events in general 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.400
 The philosopher George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel considers it a rational process towards completion. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.560
 To avoid the misinterpretation of the "end of history", Hegel was not predicting the end of the world. 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.240
 But to find out what he meant, we must first ask ourselves "What is history?" 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.220
 According to Hegel, 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.420
 History is the evolution of perception through confrontation and conflict to a large extent. 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.940
 For example, if a group of rebels surrounded a castle, 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.220
 We have opposing forces (the existing regime and its opponents). 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.420
 During this conflict, opposing ideologies will clash 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 It produces a new system. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.420
 Such as that which preceded it, will eventually pave the way for the revolution, 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.180
 And "dialectical process" produced for the growing realization, will continue. 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.600
 But these changes do not occur randomly. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.700
 For Hegel, history is driven forward by freedom, the essential nature of humankind. 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.460
 As history progresses, we become more conscious, and therefore more rational, 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.040
 Thus, more free. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.720
 For example, a warrior who earns more points of experience, 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.820
 Earns more skills. 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.740
 The more he gains, the more combat options he has, and the more free he becomes. 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.320
 Over time, we have become freer. 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.240
 During the Middle East, 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.060
 The rulers are those who were free only. In ancient Greece, some were free. 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.580
 In the time of Hegel in the wake of the French Revolution, he believed that everyone should be free. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.900
 If freedom is the ultimate goal of history, will there be an integrated state calling for no change - 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.300
 And the end of dialectic? 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.740
 In his book "The Phenomenon of the Spirit" 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.580
 Hegel developed the concept of "the spirit of the world" 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 Or to demonstrate a prominent perception through the culture of society, 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.540
 Including philosophy, religion and art. 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 We will reach absolute freedom when the spirit of the world becomes, 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 Or collective consciousness of culture, completely rational. 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.240
 Only then can a unified society be created 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.140
 Where it will invite its laws and institutions to not change 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.600
 Because they are in perfect harmony with their culture. 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.660
 Thus, the dialectical process of history will end. 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.779
 Hegel's philosophy of history was inspired 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.560
 Some of the most important thinkers of the nineteenth century, 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.060
 Including one of the young poets who will someday become one of the most influential figures in the world.
