00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.770
 it's under the roofs kristian andreasen place of creation for his brother 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.040
 inspiration in the layout of the attic treat to reconnect with the spirit 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.850
 of the family 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.910
 what sony family of painters sculptors for five generations 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.750
 there is a willingness to pay homage to my ancestors and at the same time as my 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.480
 brother michel 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.679
 they can work in this place out of time 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.379
 the furniture and objects that are in this house they are both the 

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.560
 family memories of 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.980
 a manna grandmother my mother in themselves sank the furniture 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.260
 old and some things I acquired them there are imbalances in 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 russia and especially the boxes to paint the easels but who 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.830
 were those of 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.700
 my grandparents and great-grandparents 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 of course it takes 3 I wanted to install a white paint made a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.139
 little bit like in the 19th century in the past 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:51.729
 the lime woods 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.230
 against insects there are curtains berry the rules of art 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 it's a bit of a shades of gray that customs between the good or the tissues 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.390
 humans 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.100
 the beams there are different shades of gray and beautiful things 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.360
 v ap 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.000
 it's a mail in which we did not go when we were kids but 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.890
 at what point 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.600
 what is my brother at their new stadium he said to his friends I do not know 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.020
 why my brother question to make me a 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.290
 a workshop in the attic and to live on his knees notched imagined 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.109
 that the attic was much smaller than when we arrived 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.970
 had tried these five meters tall of his talent 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.290
 we had to put a ladder from the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.110
 the neighbors to climb into our attic if he did not yield accessible 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.910
 the work was done by jacques stern who is a formidable 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.170
 master builder opposite it was really intense the man of the situation 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.440
 fig 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.480
 when I saw the state in which the treasurer I understood that it was necessary 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.170
 evacuate the only neighborhood extremely fed and seen several tons 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.930
 of materials to clear 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.760
 it's still curious mixture campaign left I was drying a 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.080
 once the beams were cleared 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.520
 but I started to make a solid age so that the floor is of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.750
 level because it was 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.170
 it was not at all responsible i fixed the lorrainees planed simply 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.239
 it's framing board 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.639
 what I said is that on the joists 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.969
 so they are a little diagonally 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.569
 it gives a side% is very simple and rustic at the same time 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.569
 since we put some 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.859
 keep the best that it was 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.879
 there it took a little bit to arrange them because it was a more or less 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.949
 falling down 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:37.269
 on the surface is the game and made a lime mortar to return 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.319
 feet to the wall set up or just the case of the days a little the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.869
 prettier than they had 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.299
 to give a lot of light in this case it was necessary to make a 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.139
 pretty big opening 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.619
 iran equipped with a glass roof and boasts push his wife 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.609
 enjoy yourself 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.229
 it's a mix 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:00.399
 even more of an old-fashioned appearance with more efficient materials 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.479
 these works were not 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.289
 binding as far as you have the right person for 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.349
 to accompany me it was very nice because we were very well 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.729
 heard with the most inspired 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:16.609
 he took me the psg plot made in the notebooks you had to have a 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.329
 a little bit of socialist creativity had for its part only exported 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.949
 v 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.500
 the most unusual thing about one in this workshop will surely be 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.269
 a sliding system for hanging watch paints 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.299
 the concept that it was precisely to make an exhibition in a place 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.539
 very small 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.579
 so we avoided fixing the parallel derailment 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.099
 according to the prosecution 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.549
 and to have some panels that's cool these are successful roulettes at the rally and 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.889
 I have my eyes closed 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.159
 Signs 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.079
 carl landry light so that help 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.839
 Russia is not changed by excessive hair 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.169
 in fact it is very easy to maneuver since the panels are 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.609
 to see that 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.229
 v 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.309
 we did the work several times 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.520
 for the broker table 100% 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.229
 the whole program should be in five or six months 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.779
 the cost for the attic over% 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.539
 these men are about 30000 and 35000 euros maximum with a finish a 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.859
 little more than the mini gallery and all parts which is a structural brake 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.050
 the floor is the slow poison for them 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.289
 the stairs there was nothing 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.590
 being in the perimeter of a 12th century church 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.780
 and it takes a building permit opening for example from the army 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.720
 behind could not be turned to the church to turn to the private 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.960
 good 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.470
 yes there is really 80 square meters to win 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.910
 of which 60 square meters livable 2% to 82 author but under the bridges but he 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.000
 there is a really special atmosphere conducive to creation 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.860
 actually getting closer to the sky getting closer to the light 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.260
 we are both returned to the outside 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.009
 and at the same time to protect themselves by these compounds passed against 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.430
 and the great happiness is actually to see my brother to live 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.419
 this workshop is a privileged space to find it on the memories 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.469
 childhood 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.979
 here to find inspiration it was enough to get closer to the site
