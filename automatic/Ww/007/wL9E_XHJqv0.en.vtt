00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 to 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.469
 hello today we are going to work with inks 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.540
 dry distress let's mix 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:24.550
 different colors and I want to show you 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:28.970
 something that I have found very useful and is 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.579
 ink my sponge and pass it on some 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.070
 occasions on a sheet of paper 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:39.440
 recycled and this what it does is like 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.079
 prepare let's say a little the sponge and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.199
 avoid a bit that we stay these as 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.030
 stripes or as if we were stamping 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:54.660
 the little square of the sponge this helps us 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.200
 to have one and a sharper inking 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.559
 and more uniform here I show you the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.870
 very basic technique that is always 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 start outside our area of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.410
 work and little by little go going towards 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.510
 the center of our role in this case 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.600
 and here what I want to do is a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.000
 sort of like collage of colors and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.160
 here good I wanted to tell you also my 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 reference with these inks has always 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.950
 been goltz team and although I admire a lot 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.440
 his work the truth is that the colors 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.920
 that he tends to use are colors with 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.619
 that I do not feel very comfortable then 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 great news is that we can also 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.369
 create a great variety a wide range of 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.009
 colors and very vivid not only vintage 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 that we know in the style of the team 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.950
 holtz but also others very vivid or 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.650
 tenors even as is the case of what 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.720
 what am I going to do now 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.970
 and good here I show you how it was used 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.850
 this same color in another area of ​​my 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.850
 paper now I'm going to change color and 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 I wanted to show you how I keep my 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.490
 inks stamped using the ink in a 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.710
 little piece of paper that he stuck on 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.130
 inks and so I can stack them and always 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.130
 know what color is the one that I'm going 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.510
 to take another recommendation that I want 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.700
 to make them is that they always have 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.700
 different sponges for different 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.940
 types of colors they have in my case 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.930
 I have one for all the tones in this 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.050
 purple case another one for the pink blues 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.690
 etcetera this helps us to maintain as 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.370
 the purity let's say in the colors or 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.110
 they can wash the sponges 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.920
 are washable here I want to show you how 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.739
 I'm changing color but I'm 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.920
 passing it over the orange that I already had 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.340
 and this is to mix the colors here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.709
 I show you the same thing with another tone and 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.860
 just by passing it over allows us 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.860
 mix very well and get the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.579
 transitions to another color be more 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.590
 natural that do not look like stripes 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:23.160
 marked between one color and another 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.040
 this is why I 'm going back to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.519
 my main color that was the first the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.459
 orange and again I will go through 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.220
 over the neighboring colors so 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.660
 say it here I show you an idea of ​​what 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.569
 what can be done with that kind of 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.500
 papers I did not cut several flowers that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.360
 can use 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.820
 and now I'm going to go over the edges with 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.300
 this tone that is not seen here but is 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.300
 purple 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.040
 around my whole sheet and this is how 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.189
 to focus attention 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.060
 and take it to the center of the paper and 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.960
 do not come out now I'm going to stamp this 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.390
 seal 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.950
 just my paper now to start putting together a 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.890
 project properly 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.859
 and for this an ink is also 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.819
 distress 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.889
 in a brown tone quite clear that 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.500
 I want it to be like a very subtle background 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.080
 so that it does not compete with all 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.099
 colors 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.069
 and who has this role not then I'm going to 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:37.939
 continue stamping everything along 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:40.430
 this sheet using this same stamp and here 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:43.880
 I show you the cav in my sheet I put a 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.260
 little detail in the upper right corner 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.330
 and now I want to decorate with some flowers and 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.180
 these are the same as part of the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.830
 another paper but as they are very colorful 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.450
 I did not want them to compete with my fund 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:03.830
 then I use this same clear tone 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:07.220
 that I used to stamp and now I'm going to use 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.980
 I'm going to try this other stamp with the 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.540
 same ink to create this effect of 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:17.190
 tone on tone 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:22.190
 and since I try well the whole area I'm going to 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.190
 place the flowers on the stamp 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:31.840
 Here I show you placed them on the 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.870
 seal and I'm going to help from a little leaf of 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.620
 recycling 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.590
 to pass my hand very well for the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.080
 figures and that is perfectly impregnated 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.650
 of ink 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.319
 and I do this with each of the figures 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.639
 and now I'm going to show you how pretty 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.129
 remain 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.770
 one 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:59.520
 something very subtle to see super elegant 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.620
 not then I put them together and they 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.409
 I already show how my project was 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.009
 finished cut also butterflies with 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.979
 this same and colored paper here is 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:14.340
 the flower already armed here can see the 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.550
 project already completed and I wanted to show you 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:22.260
 another example using one of these flowers 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.720
 that cut already mounted on a card 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.330
 I made the background with ink 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.330
 distress and seal 2 in the same tone 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.210
 about this that in dye and is also 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.280
 starting the flower as the leaves I hope 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.010
 that you liked it if they have any 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.630
 doubt please let me know them 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.630
 I appreciate that you accompanied me
