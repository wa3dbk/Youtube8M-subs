just like this I'm not going to waste

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
just like this I'm not going to waste
time<00:00:53.940> putting<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.600> these<00:00:54.750> together<00:00:54.989> because

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
right this heater here's gonna made

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.130 
right this heater here's gonna made
earlier<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.809> your<00:01:01.020> brain<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:03.140> now

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
earlier so you have your brain here now

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.310 
earlier so you have your brain here now
first<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:06.020> is<00:01:07.020> make

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
first of all what we have to do is make

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.340 
first of all what we have to do is make
sure<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.159> frame<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.939> square<00:01:12.110> just<00:01:13.110> by

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sure that this frame is square just by

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
sure that this frame is square just by
measuring<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.100> diagonals<00:01:14.640> which<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.090> one

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
measuring the diagonals which this one

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.499 
measuring the diagonals which this one
is<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.409> isn't<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.130> simply<00:01:17.580> tap<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> edges

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is if it isn't just simply tap the edges

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
is if it isn't just simply tap the edges
to<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.500> square<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.310> re<00:01:20.520> measure<00:01:22.880> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to make it square and then re measure so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
to make it square and then re measure so
you<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.330> image<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.009> we

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you have your image here and what we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.319 
you have your image here and what we
need<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.909> pop<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> frame<00:01:28.259> exactly<00:01:29.329> on

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
need to do is pop the frame exactly on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.100 
need to do is pop the frame exactly on
the<00:01:30.720> center<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> image<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the center of the image so that it's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.130 
the center of the image so that it's
aligned<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.320> pencil

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140

carefully keep it in place and then mark

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.219 
carefully keep it in place and then mark
the<00:01:43.590> corners<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> pencil<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.720> edge<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the corners with a pencil at the edge of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:02:03.100 
the corners with a pencil at the edge of
the<00:01:46.350> frame<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.340> so

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.800 

so<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.410> you've<00:02:04.620> got<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.920> marks<00:02:05.570> turn<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
so now you've got it marks turn the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.100 
so now you've got it marks turn the
image<00:02:07.020> over<00:02:08.030> before<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> actually<00:02:09.780> I'm

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.699 

turn<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.290> image<00:02:19.410> over<00:02:20.240> pop<00:02:21.240> your<00:02:21.480> frame<00:02:21.780> over

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709

then<00:02:30.799> all<00:02:31.799> we<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:35.310> using<00:02:35.730> our

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
then all we have to do is using our

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.679 
then all we have to do is using our
staple<00:02:36.389> gun<00:02:37.069> mount<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.280> image<00:02:38.609> now<00:02:39.299> just

staple gun mount the image now just

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:45.739 
staple gun mount the image now just
mount<00:02:40.819> two<00:02:41.819> sides<00:02:44.450> little<00:02:45.450> bit<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.689> a

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:45.749 
mount two sides little bit of a

mount two sides little bit of a
malfunction<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.500> gunner

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.230 

then<00:03:01.570> turn<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.050> over<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.710> check<00:03:03.100> if<00:03:03.520> your<00:03:03.910> image

then turn it over to check if your image

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.440 
then turn it over to check if your image
is<00:03:04.420> central<00:03:06.090> we'll<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.420> do<00:03:07.630> another<00:03:08.020> staple

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.450 

and<00:03:13.450> another<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.460> there<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:18.100> you've<00:03:18.220> got<00:03:18.310> your

and another one there so you've got your

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:26.310 
and another one there so you've got your
four<00:03:18.730> staples<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.210> can<00:03:25.360> see<00:03:25.420> that

four staples in and as you can see that

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.400 
four staples in and as you can see that
image<00:03:26.740> is<00:03:27.100> nice<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.880> central<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.050> we're<00:03:29.230> ready

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
image is nice and central so we're ready

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.500 
image is nice and central so we're ready
to<00:03:29.650> stretch<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.340> rest<00:03:30.550> of<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.760> image<00:03:31.030> over

to stretch the rest of the image over
the<00:03:31.540> bars<00:03:34.110> now<00:03:35.110> at<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.650> canvas<00:03:35.890> print<00:03:36.280> shop<00:03:36.580> we

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
the bars now at the canvas print shop we

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.630 
the bars now at the canvas print shop we
use<00:03:36.940> these<00:03:37.150> calipers<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:39.130> we<00:03:39.250> can<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.520> it

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
use these calipers so we can get it

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.090 
use these calipers so we can get it
really<00:03:39.910> taut<00:03:40.360> but<00:03:41.140> if<00:03:41.320> you're<00:03:41.530> doing<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:41.860> at

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
really taut but if you're doing this at

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:52.080 
really taut but if you're doing this at
home<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:44.520> can<00:03:45.520> use<00:03:45.610> your<00:03:46.060> fingers<00:03:50.700> turn<00:03:51.700> round

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
home you can use your fingers turn round

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:17.770 
home you can use your fingers turn round
each<00:03:52.300> side<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.200> get<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:53.380> nice<00:03:53.680> even<00:03:54.010> stretch

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.659 

now<00:04:18.780> keep<00:04:19.459> checking<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.820> as<00:04:21.060> I'm<00:04:21.239> doing<00:04:21.449> it

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
now keep checking it as I'm doing it

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:36.320 
now keep checking it as I'm doing it
just<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.880> make<00:04:24.060> sure<00:04:24.090> it's<00:04:24.840> nice<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.110> taut<00:04:35.330> now

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
just to make sure it's nice and taut now

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
just to make sure it's nice and taut now
when<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.720> get<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.080> corners<00:04:39.199> have<00:04:40.199> to

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
when you get to the corners have to

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.749 
when you get to the corners have to
pinch<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.949> side<00:04:41.190> into<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.120> fold<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:43.520> then<00:04:44.520> just

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
pinch the side into a fold and then just

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:53.270 
pinch the side into a fold and then just
trim<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.300> corner<00:04:45.720> off<00:04:45.870> like<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:48.740> then<00:04:52.280> put

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
trim the corner off like that then put

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.320 
trim the corner off like that then put
one<00:04:53.460> lap<00:04:53.669> stapling<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.570> edge<00:04:55.789> tuck<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:57.060> side

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
one lap stapling that edge tuck the side

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.529 
one lap stapling that edge tuck the side
in<00:04:57.919> these<00:04:58.919> scissors<00:04:59.370> pull<00:05:00.030> really<00:05:00.389> tight<00:05:02.539> and

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
in these scissors pull really tight and

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.790 
in these scissors pull really tight and
then<00:05:03.770> pull<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.919> corner<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:06.590> they<00:05:07.590> have<00:05:07.770> a

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
then pull that corner in they have a

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:18.340 
then pull that corner in they have a
nice<00:05:08.039> clean<00:05:08.550> edge<00:05:08.759> like<00:05:09.750> that

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.560 

now<00:05:19.350> what<00:05:19.620> tend<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.130> do<00:05:20.310> is<00:05:20.790> just<00:05:21.060> trim<00:05:21.330> these

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
now what tend to do is just trim these

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.290 
now what tend to do is just trim these
edges<00:05:22.080> off<00:05:22.230> nice<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.980> tidally<00:05:25.940> so<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.210> it

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
edges off nice and tidally so that it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.570 
edges off nice and tidally so that it
looks<00:05:27.540> good<00:05:27.810> from<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.170> back<00:05:28.380> when<00:05:28.770> we<00:05:28.890> take<00:05:29.160> it

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.340 

so<00:05:35.580> what<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:35.820> do<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.120> just<00:05:36.450> do<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.810> with<00:05:37.080> each

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
so what I do is just do that with each

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.780 
so what I do is just do that with each
corner<00:05:37.830> so<00:05:38.220> again<00:05:38.610> pinch<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.390> edges<00:05:40.670> trim<00:05:41.670> it

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
corner so again pinch the edges trim it

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.650 
corner so again pinch the edges trim it
off<00:05:45.020> staple<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.230> edge<00:05:47.000> if<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.150> staples

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
off staple that edge if the staples

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.150 
off staple that edge if the staples
don't<00:05:48.900> go<00:05:49.080> in<00:05:49.260> it's<00:05:49.470> just<00:05:49.710> because<00:05:50.040> of<00:05:50.070> the

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
don't go in it's just because of the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:06:04.460 
don't go in it's just because of the
knot<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.610> wood<00:05:50.910> so<00:05:52.610> gentle<00:05:53.610> hammer

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:15.770 

then<00:06:05.470> took<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.010> edge<00:06:06.100> ins<00:06:06.430> tight<00:06:07.090> as<00:06:07.360> you<00:06:07.480> can

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.310 

staple<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:17.230> edge<00:06:21.660> as<00:06:22.660> you<00:06:22.780> can<00:06:22.930> see<00:06:23.170> we're

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
staple the edge as you can see we're

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.280 
staple the edge as you can see we're
just<00:06:23.350> working<00:06:23.740> our<00:06:24.130> way<00:06:24.160> around<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:26.050> another

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
just working our way around so another

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:34.970 
just working our way around so another
corner<00:06:27.030> nice<00:06:28.030> tight<00:06:28.450> crease<00:06:29.940> trim<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.150> edge

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:43.560 

hold<00:06:35.980> it<00:06:36.340> in<00:06:41.490> it's<00:06:42.490> easy<00:06:42.670> to<00:06:42.940> just<00:06:43.090> trim<00:06:43.360> these

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
hold it in it's easy to just trim these

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.910 
hold it in it's easy to just trim these
excesses<00:06:44.290> off<00:06:46.020> before<00:06:47.020> you<00:06:47.230> actually<00:06:47.380> finish

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
excesses off before you actually finish

00:06:47.920 --> 00:07:03.609 
excesses off before you actually finish
the<00:06:48.100> final<00:06:48.310> staking<00:06:48.970> on<00:06:49.090> the<00:06:49.210> corner

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:03.619 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:15.049 

we<00:07:04.619> are<00:07:04.740> down<00:07:04.979> to<00:07:05.009> the<00:07:05.189> last<00:07:05.249> call<00:07:05.699> now<00:07:14.059> and

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:15.059 
we are down to the last call now and

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.179 
we are down to the last call now and
that<00:07:15.360> one's<00:07:15.569> on<00:07:15.779> a<00:07:15.809> bit<00:07:16.020> not<00:07:16.349> good<00:07:16.589> so<00:07:16.979> just

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:17.189 
that one's on a bit not good so just

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:41.980 
that one's on a bit not good so just
give<00:07:17.339> it<00:07:17.429> a<00:07:17.490> bash

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.190 

and<00:07:42.990> there<00:07:43.230> you<00:07:43.380> have<00:07:43.440> the<00:07:44.960> final<00:07:45.960> canvas

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.200 
and there you have the final canvas

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.490 
and there you have the final canvas
print<00:07:46.650> and<00:07:47.640> what<00:07:47.850> we<00:07:48.000> do<00:07:48.300> just<00:07:48.840> to<00:07:49.050> finish<00:07:49.230> off

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 
print and what we do just to finish off

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.940 
print and what we do just to finish off
the<00:07:49.680> edges<00:07:49.770> is<00:07:50.400> we<00:07:51.060> put<00:07:51.300> some<00:07:51.540> tape<00:07:51.870> over<00:07:54.950> the

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:55.950 
the edges is we put some tape over the

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.310 
the edges is we put some tape over the
edges<00:07:56.280> so<00:07:56.490> they<00:07:56.610> don't<00:07:56.820> fray<00:07:57.210> and<00:07:57.840> then<00:07:58.200> we

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.320 
edges so they don't fray and then we

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.660 
edges so they don't fray and then we
parcel<00:07:58.740> it<00:07:58.830> up<00:07:58.980> and<00:07:59.880> send<00:08:00.180> it<00:08:00.300> begin
