00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.910 

I<00:00:56.059> recommend<00:00:56.960> saving<00:00:57.199> some<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.559> your<00:00:57.680> mortar

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
I recommend saving some of your mortar

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.340 
I recommend saving some of your mortar
shots<00:00:58.129> for<00:00:58.340> later<00:00:58.489> on<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.699> level<00:00:59.050> when<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.199> need

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
shots for later on a level when you need

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.520 
shots for later on a level when you need
to<00:01:00.379> take<00:01:00.649> out<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.660> other<00:01:02.870> mortar<00:01:03.230> crews

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
to take out the the other mortar crews

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.210 
to take out the the other mortar crews
and<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.309> boomers<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.799> rivers<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.130> the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
and the boomers and rivers and the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.810 
and the boomers and rivers and the
rebirth

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 

and<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.480> would<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.840> recommend<00:01:16.110> jumping<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.860> on

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and I would not recommend jumping up on

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440 
and I would not recommend jumping up on
that<00:01:17.100> turret<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.090> leaves<00:01:18.300> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that turret because it really leaves you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.240 
that turret because it really leaves you
exposed<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.870> second<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
exposed in a second here the more the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.310 
exposed in a second here the more the
first<00:01:26.490> challenge<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.660> level<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.050> mortar

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
first challenge of this level the mortar

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.490 
first challenge of this level the mortar
crews<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.860> show<00:01:29.010> up<00:01:29.220> Oh<00:01:30.500> actually

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the first challenge is these guys that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
the first challenge is these guys that
jump<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.600> boat<00:01:34.320> there's<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.890> be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
jump up on the boat there's going to be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.170 
jump up on the boat there's going to be
two<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.160> them<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.610> left<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
two of them one of the left and one of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.990 
two of them one of the left and one of
the<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.550> take<00:01:41.700> them<00:01:41.850> out

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the right so you can take them out

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.840 
the right so you can take them out
quickly<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.540> stay<00:01:43.050> behind<00:01:43.110> cover<00:01:43.710> stay<00:01:44.700> with

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
quickly I stay behind cover stay with

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.749 
quickly I stay behind cover stay with
your<00:01:44.970> back<00:01:45.210> against<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.630> wall<00:01:45.900> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.259> can

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
your back against that wall if you can

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
your back against that wall if you can
so<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> don't<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.090> shot<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:48.539> down<00:01:48.720> below<00:01:48.869> by

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so you don't get shot from down below by

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:00.250 
so you don't get shot from down below by
the<00:01:49.289> other<00:01:49.470> guys

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.470 

so<00:02:00.890> if<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.280> see<00:02:01.520> those<00:02:01.700> other<00:02:01.910> mortar<00:02:02.240> crews

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
so if you see those other mortar crews

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.590 
so if you see those other mortar crews
get<00:02:02.810> off<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.960> shot<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.800> better<00:02:04.010> move<00:02:04.600> because

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
get off a shot you better move because

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.020 
get off a shot you better move because
those<00:02:06.380> mortars<00:02:06.920> are<00:02:07.100> not<00:02:07.280> forgiving<00:02:07.820> if<00:02:07.940> you

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
those mortars are not forgiving if you

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.300 
those mortars are not forgiving if you
get<00:02:08.180> hit<00:02:08.330> by<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> year<00:02:08.899> pretty<00:02:09.200> much<00:02:09.380> done<00:02:15.310> now

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
get hit by a year pretty much done now

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.440 
get hit by a year pretty much done now
that<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.520> kill<00:02:16.670> those<00:02:16.790> mortars<00:02:17.150> gonna<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.390> a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
that you kill those mortars gonna be a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
that you kill those mortars gonna be a
couple<00:02:17.600> boomers<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.800> boomers<00:02:19.130> aren't

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
couple boomers and the boomers aren't

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.820 
couple boomers and the boomers aren't
too<00:02:19.460> hard<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.760> kill<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.150> mortars<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:23.830> you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
too hard to kill the mortars because you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.440 
too hard to kill the mortars because you
know<00:02:24.950> you're<00:02:25.370> pretty<00:02:25.640> much<00:02:25.760> behind<00:02:26.030> cover

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
