00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.460 
Lords are probably pretty much you know
they're<00:01:45.450> full<00:01:45.600> members<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.259> horde

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
they're full members they are in horde

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
they're full members they are in horde
so<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> problem<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.420> us

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so it's a little bit of a problem for us

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
so it's a little bit of a problem for us
now<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.320> Thunder<00:01:49.680> Lords<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.130> also<00:01:50.310> very

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
now the Thunder Lords are also very

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.609 
now the Thunder Lords are also very
heavily<00:01:51.180> involved<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> subjugation<00:01:52.590> of

heavily involved in the subjugation of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
heavily involved in the subjugation of
the<00:01:53.040> Grom<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.210> are<00:01:54.329> constantly<00:01:54.570> seeing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the Grom and we are constantly seeing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
the Grom and we are constantly seeing
them<00:01:55.470> hunting<00:01:55.950> various<00:01:56.310> groan<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.000> beasts

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
throughout the zone and in fact I'd

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.429 
throughout the zone and in fact I'd
imagine<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> groan<00:02:01.020> they're<00:02:01.229> being

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
