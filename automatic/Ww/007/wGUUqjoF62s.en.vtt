this is wired at half on nominal we're
gonna<00:01:43.729> try<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:43.939> roll<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.149> up<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.420> see<00:01:44.719> if<00:01:44.840> we

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
gonna try to roll it up and see if we

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.529 
gonna try to roll it up and see if we
can<00:01:45.109> get<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:46.219> stay<00:01:46.429> out<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.670> protect<00:01:47.119> that

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
can get it to stay out of protect that
