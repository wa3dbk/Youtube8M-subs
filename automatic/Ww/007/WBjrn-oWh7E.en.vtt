 life 80 cents seller indicated price 9 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:12.010
 There should be dollars in the package 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:20.979

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.479
 all packed at all well yet 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:46.600

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:50.520
 check what the packing is going here 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:56.700

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:09.040
 the logo is present here itself 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:17.770
 the glasses themselves are not small I thought that 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:20.380
 more what's done 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:26.830

 bolted on there is a baby here 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.210

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:42.940
 plastic is painted everywhere 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:50.970

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:59.850

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.850

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:25.140
 suede outside leather seal 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.140
