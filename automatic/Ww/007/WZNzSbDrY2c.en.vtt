00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to show you the clay extruder that I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.620 
to show you the clay extruder that I
like<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> use<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.480> because

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
like to use and I like this one because

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.769 
like to use and I like this one because
it<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.320> longer<00:00:25.949> tube<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.510> holds<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it has a longer tube on it so it holds a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.109 
it has a longer tube on it so it holds a
little<00:00:28.019> more<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.529> fondant<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.039> gum<00:00:29.070> paste<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
little more of fondant or gum paste and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
little more of fondant or gum paste and
it<00:00:30.359> comes<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.660> several<00:00:31.199> different<00:00:31.410> design

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it comes with several different design

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
it comes with several different design
dies<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.700> fit<00:00:33.059> into<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> end<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.930> I'll

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
dies that you fit into the end and I'll

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
dies that you fit into the end and I'll
show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> works<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.250> moment

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
show you how that works in just a moment

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.770 
show you how that works in just a moment
it<00:00:36.270> comes<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.840> twist<00:00:37.469> handle<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
it comes with this twist handle and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
it comes with this twist handle and
that's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.930> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.200> difficult<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:41.370> work

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that's a little bit difficult to work

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.779 
that's a little bit difficult to work
with<00:00:41.690> keep<00:00:42.690> twisting<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.760> have

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
with keep twisting like that so we have

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.760 
with keep twisting like that so we have
a<00:00:45.450> tool<00:00:46.320> company<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.070> makes<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:48.379> crank<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.649> us

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
a tool company that makes a crank for us

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.729 
a tool company that makes a crank for us
that<00:00:50.270> makes<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> lot<00:00:51.570> easier<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.050> cranking

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that makes it a lot easier for cranking

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.260 
that makes it a lot easier for cranking
that<00:00:52.860> I'll<00:00:53.100> show<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.309> how<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.699> works<00:00:53.879> also

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that I'll show you how that works also

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
that I'll show you how that works also
and<00:00:54.780> show<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> couple<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.010> designs<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and show you a couple of designs that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
and show you a couple of designs that
you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.360> extrude<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.800> and<00:01:00.199> here<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you can extrude out of here and here is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.440 
you can extrude out of here and here is
the<00:01:02.059> handle<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:04.040> remove<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:06.299> we

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the handle that we remove and then we

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.899 
the handle that we remove and then we
put<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> crank<00:01:07.229> handle<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
put this crank handle on there so this

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.020 
put this crank handle on there so this
the<00:01:09.659> crank<00:01:09.930> handle<00:01:10.560> works<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.850> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the crank handle works like this so it's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.570 
the crank handle works like this so it's
a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.510> easier<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.260> work<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.920> than

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
a little bit easier to work with than

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.050 
a little bit easier to work with than
with<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> twist<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> turn<00:01:16.020> handle<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.060> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
with the twist and turn handle so so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
with the twist and turn handle so so
here's<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:19.049> different<00:01:19.380> parts<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
here's the different parts to the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.210 
here's the different parts to the
extruder<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> plunger<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> goes

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
extruder this is the plunger that goes

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.210 
extruder this is the plunger that goes
down<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.439> either<00:01:25.439> twist<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:26.070> use

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
down in there as you either twist or use

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.480 
down in there as you either twist or use
the<00:01:26.520> crank<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> change<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:29.280> has

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the crank if you change that and it has

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
the crank if you change that and it has
a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.820> o-ring<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.869> plunger<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a little o-ring on the plunger there and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.670 
a little o-ring on the plunger there and
the<00:01:32.250> set<00:01:32.549> comes<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.390> extra<00:01:34.229> o<00:01:34.259> ring

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the set comes with a an extra o ring

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.810 
the set comes with a an extra o ring
case<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.280> need<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
case you need it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.950 
case you need it
that<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.329> wears<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.909> then<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.570> tube

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that one wears out and then the tube

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.469 
that one wears out and then the tube
where<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.380> fondant<00:01:40.890> goes<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.880> gum<00:01:42.270> paste

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
where your fondant goes in or gum paste

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.899 
where your fondant goes in or gum paste
and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:44.149> then<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> put<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> die

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
and then then you put one of the die

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.289 
and then then you put one of the die
inside<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> end<00:01:50.570> put<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.689> tube<00:01:52.049> back<00:01:52.320> on

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
inside the end put this tube back on

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.370 
inside the end put this tube back on
normally<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.420> wouldn't<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> take<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
normally you wouldn't have to take that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.789 
normally you wouldn't have to take that
off<00:01:55.439> except<00:01:55.860> maybe<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.130> clean<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
off except maybe to clean it then to

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.830 
off except maybe to clean it then to
fill<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> extruder<00:01:59.939> I've<00:02:00.060> rolled<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.630> log

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
fill the extruder I've rolled out at log

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
fill the extruder I've rolled out at log
of<00:02:01.110> fondant<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.829> put<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.430> bit<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of fondant and put a little bit of

fondant and the shape of the die this

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.040 
fondant and the shape of the die this
particular<00:02:38.080> one<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.740> one<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.720> can<00:02:40.750> use

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
particular one is one that you can use

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.940 
particular one is one that you can use
to<00:02:41.200> make<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.380> rope<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.780> what<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.050> do<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.440> you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
to make a rope and what you do is you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.420 
to make a rope and what you do is you
just<00:02:45.030> get<00:02:46.030> them<00:02:46.200> one<00:02:47.200> top<00:02:47.560> one<00:02:47.770> straight<00:02:48.130> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
just get them one top one straight and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.260 
just get them one top one straight and
then<00:02:49.180> start<00:02:50.080> twisting<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.910> make<00:02:52.060> sure<00:02:52.090> you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
then start twisting it and make sure you

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.390 
then start twisting it and make sure you
twist<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> same<00:02:53.640> amount<00:02:54.640> throughout

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
twist it at the same amount throughout

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.040 
twist it at the same amount throughout
and<00:02:57.570> then<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.660> makes<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:59.140> rope

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and then it makes a rope

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.780 
and then it makes a rope
another<00:03:02.050> cool<00:03:02.350> used<00:03:02.770> for<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> extruder<00:03:03.490> is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
another cool used for the extruder is

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.790 
another cool used for the extruder is
for<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.360> care<00:03:04.990> for<00:03:05.290> figures

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.190 

and<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:14.570> has<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.350> style<00:03:15.710> of<00:03:16.570> dye<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.960> there

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
and it has this style of dye in there

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.650 
and it has this style of dye in there
that's<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:19.220> different<00:03:19.580> sizes<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.420> can

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
that's in different sizes so you can

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.010 
that's in different sizes so you can
make<00:03:20.900> any<00:03:20.930> size<00:03:21.710> you<00:03:21.950> want<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.970> if<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.840> use<00:03:23.990> a

make any size you want and if you use a
palette<00:03:24.500> knife<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:25.100> kind<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.610> get<00:03:25.730> a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
palette knife you can kind of get a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.810 
palette knife you can kind of get a
clean<00:03:26.060> end<00:03:26.360> here<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.950> lot<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.100> times<00:03:28.310> then<00:03:28.640> they

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
clean end here a lot of times then they

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.180 
clean end here a lot of times then they
sort<00:03:29.210> of<00:03:29.330> join<00:03:29.570> together<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.010> would

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
sort of join together and so you would

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.630 
sort of join together and so you would
have<00:03:31.370> your<00:03:31.550> hair<00:03:31.880> or<00:03:32.210> whatever<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.430> dyes
