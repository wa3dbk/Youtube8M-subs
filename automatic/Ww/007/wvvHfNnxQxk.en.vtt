which is inspired by inner tube tires so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
which is inspired by inner tube tires so
you<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you could see that right here it's a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.499 
you could see that right here it's a
tube-like<00:01:22.650> formation<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.670> around<00:01:24.360> the

tube-like formation going around the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
tube-like formation going around the
foot<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.259> gets<00:01:25.439> its<00:01:26.159> name

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
foot so that's where it gets its name

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.249 
foot so that's where it gets its name
from<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:26.729> officially<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.240> name<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
adidas tubular now the adidas tubular

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.510 
adidas tubular now the adidas tubular
like<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> said<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.740> designed<00:01:38.100> by<00:01:38.220> Nick

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
worn in my entire life but it is very

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.259 
worn in my entire life but it is very

boost<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.400> think<00:03:47.669> that<00:03:47.790> would<00:03:47.879> be<00:03:47.910> pretty

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150

ill<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.519> comfort<00:03:50.519> wise<00:03:50.669> very<00:03:51.569> comfortable

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
ill so comfort wise very comfortable

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.740

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
very lightweight very streamlined and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.270 
very lightweight very streamlined and
form-fitting<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.500> foot<00:03:55.709> when<00:03:55.919> it's<00:03:56.069> on

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
design which also has nods back to the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.789 
design which also has nods back to the
