00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.789 

hi<00:00:04.450> I'm<00:00:04.900> Jimmy<00:00:05.170> Chang<00:00:05.350> and<00:00:05.470> we're<00:00:05.620> here<00:00:05.710> to

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:05.799 
hi I'm Jimmy Chang and we're here to

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.980 
hi I'm Jimmy Chang and we're here to
talk<00:00:05.980> about<00:00:06.270> negative<00:00:07.270> and<00:00:07.420> positive<00:00:07.779> rules

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
talk about negative and positive rules

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.409 
talk about negative and positive rules
for<00:00:08.230> multiplication<00:00:08.589> and<00:00:08.919> division<00:00:09.309> so<00:00:09.579> the

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:10.419 
for multiplication and division so the

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:11.819 
for multiplication and division so the
rules<00:00:10.749> are<00:00:10.809> pretty<00:00:10.900> consistent<00:00:11.259> so<00:00:11.559> let's<00:00:11.709> get

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:11.829 
rules are pretty consistent so let's get

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.409 
rules are pretty consistent so let's get
right<00:00:11.949> to<00:00:12.009> it<00:00:12.249> now<00:00:12.549> multiplication<00:00:13.329> and

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 
right to it now multiplication and

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.180 
right to it now multiplication and
division<00:00:13.780> are<00:00:13.959> very<00:00:14.199> similar<00:00:14.469> in<00:00:14.619> terms<00:00:14.799> of

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
division are very similar in terms of

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.340 
division are very similar in terms of
how<00:00:15.699> they<00:00:15.879> work<00:00:16.090> so<00:00:16.119> let's<00:00:16.630> discuss<00:00:17.230> them

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
how they work so let's discuss them

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.260 
how they work so let's discuss them
right<00:00:17.530> now<00:00:17.650> so<00:00:18.400> first<00:00:18.550> of<00:00:18.730> all<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:19.000> one<00:00:19.120> thing

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
right now so first of all the one thing

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.110 
right now so first of all the one thing
to<00:00:19.390> consider<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:20.050> if<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.710> two<00:00:21.190> numbers<00:00:21.220> signs

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
to consider is if the two numbers signs

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.180 
to consider is if the two numbers signs
are<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.570> same<00:00:22.600> when<00:00:23.590> you<00:00:23.680> multiply<00:00:24.010> or<00:00:24.160> divide

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
are the same when you multiply or divide

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.070 
are the same when you multiply or divide
them<00:00:24.580> it's<00:00:24.730> gonna<00:00:24.910> be<00:00:25.090> positive<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.810> then<00:00:25.990> if

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
them it's gonna be positive and then if

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.870 
them it's gonna be positive and then if
they're<00:00:26.230> not<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.470> same<00:00:26.610> there's<00:00:27.610> gonna<00:00:27.730> be

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
they're not the same there's gonna be

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.850 
they're not the same there's gonna be
negative<00:00:28.270> so<00:00:28.420> here's<00:00:28.660> what<00:00:28.810> I<00:00:28.840> mean<00:00:29.080> if<00:00:29.260> you

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
negative so here's what I mean if you

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.569 
negative so here's what I mean if you
have<00:00:30.270> positive<00:00:31.270> 3<00:00:31.810> times<00:00:32.409> positive<00:00:32.800> 4<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.550> think

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
have positive 3 times positive 4 I think

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.979 
have positive 3 times positive 4 I think
you<00:00:33.909> know<00:00:34.089> that's<00:00:34.390> going<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.659> be<00:00:34.749> positive

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
you know that's going to be positive

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.599 
you know that's going to be positive
that's<00:00:35.620> going<00:00:35.859> to<00:00:35.949> be<00:00:36.039> 12<00:00:36.749> now<00:00:37.749> if<00:00:38.140> you<00:00:39.100> have<00:00:39.309> a

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
that's going to be 12 now if you have a

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.220 
that's going to be 12 now if you have a
negative<00:00:40.589> 3<00:00:41.589> times<00:00:42.219> a<00:00:42.399> negative<00:00:42.909> 4<00:00:43.120> notice<00:00:43.809> the

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
negative 3 times a negative 4 notice the

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.229 
negative 3 times a negative 4 notice the
signs<00:00:44.530> match<00:00:45.039> and<00:00:45.339> the<00:00:45.399> first<00:00:45.609> example<00:00:46.089> and

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
signs match and the first example and

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.119 
signs match and the first example and
notice<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.629> signs<00:00:46.899> match<00:00:47.289> here<00:00:47.949> in<00:00:47.979> the

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
notice the signs match here in the

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.799 
notice the signs match here in the
second<00:00:48.399> example<00:00:48.519> when<00:00:49.269> you<00:00:49.359> multiply<00:00:49.749> two

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
second example when you multiply two

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.349 
second example when you multiply two
numbers<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.559> have<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.249> same<00:00:51.339> sign<00:00:51.789> it's

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
numbers that have the same sign it's

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.939 
numbers that have the same sign it's
going<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.629> be<00:00:52.690> positive<00:00:52.929> so<00:00:53.229> negative<00:00:53.679> times<00:00:53.829> a

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
going to be positive so negative times a

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.399 
going to be positive so negative times a
negative<00:00:53.979> is<00:00:54.370> going<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.579> give<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.819> a<00:00:54.850> positive

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
negative is going to give you a positive

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.289 
negative is going to give you a positive
okay<00:00:56.440> now<00:00:56.769> same<00:00:57.010> thing<00:00:57.039> with<00:00:57.249> division<00:00:57.609> if<00:00:57.879> you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
okay now same thing with division if you

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.500 
okay now same thing with division if you
have<00:00:58.649> positive<00:00:59.649> 4<00:00:59.829> divided<00:01:00.219> by<00:01:00.249> positive<00:01:00.609> 7

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
have positive 4 divided by positive 7

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
have positive 4 divided by positive 7
obviously<00:01:02.409> that's<00:01:02.859> going<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.159> stay<00:01:03.429> positive

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
obviously that's going to stay positive

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.790 
obviously that's going to stay positive
however<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.540> have<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.660> negative<00:01:08.140> 6<00:01:08.380> divided

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
however if you have a negative 6 divided

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.460 
however if you have a negative 6 divided
by<00:01:08.830> negative<00:01:08.890> 3<00:01:09.310> again<00:01:10.150> because<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.140> two

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
by negative 3 again because the two

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.080 
by negative 3 again because the two
numbers<00:01:11.800> divided<00:01:12.160> by<00:01:12.520> each<00:01:12.670> other<00:01:12.850> had<00:01:13.000> the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
numbers divided by each other had the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.630 
numbers divided by each other had the
same<00:01:13.270> sign<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:15.040> going<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.310> be<00:01:15.400> positive

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
same sign it's going to be positive

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.520 
same sign it's going to be positive
because<00:01:16.090> negative<00:01:16.540> over<00:01:17.110> negative<00:01:17.140> is<00:01:17.440> going

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
because negative over negative is going

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.850 
because negative over negative is going
to<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.710> positive<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:18.280> 6<00:01:18.700> over<00:01:18.850> 3<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:20.740> to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
to be positive so 6 over 3 is going to

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.380 
to be positive so 6 over 3 is going to
be<00:01:20.950> 2<00:01:21.370> so<00:01:22.470> positive<00:01:23.470> times<00:01:23.680> positive<00:01:24.390> negative

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
be 2 so positive times positive negative

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.450 
be 2 so positive times positive negative
times<00:01:25.570> negative<00:01:25.690> positive<00:01:26.650> divided<00:01:27.370> by

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
times negative positive divided by

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.310 
times negative positive divided by
positive<00:01:27.810> negative<00:01:28.810> divided<00:01:29.140> by<00:01:29.260> negative

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
positive negative divided by negative

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.350 
positive negative divided by negative
they're<00:01:30.160> all<00:01:30.310> going<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.610> give<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:30.850> positive

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
they're all going to give you positive

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.330 
they're all going to give you positive
results<00:01:31.750> now<00:01:32.170> when<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.860> two<00:01:33.040> numbers

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
results now when the two numbers

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.040 
results now when the two numbers
multiplied<00:01:33.820> or<00:01:34.090> divided<00:01:34.360> 2<00:01:34.540> have<00:01:34.660> different

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
multiplied or divided 2 have different

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.810 
multiplied or divided 2 have different
signs<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.830> final<00:01:36.160> result<00:01:36.400> is<00:01:36.460> always<00:01:36.700> going

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
signs the final result is always going

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.380 
signs the final result is always going
to<00:01:36.910> be<00:01:37.000> negative<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:38.050> if<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.260> have<00:01:38.760> 7<00:01:39.760> times

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
to be negative so if you have 7 times

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.750 
to be negative so if you have 7 times
negative<00:01:40.690> 3<00:01:41.200> positive<00:01:41.770> times<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.370> negative<00:01:42.400> is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
negative 3 positive times a negative is

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.880 
negative 3 positive times a negative is
going<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:42.940> be<00:01:43.090> negative<00:01:43.360> 7<00:01:44.290> times<00:01:44.470> 3<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:44.770> going

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
going to be negative 7 times 3 is going

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.550 
going to be negative 7 times 3 is going
to<00:01:44.950> give<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.160> 21<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.050> have<00:01:47.230> for

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
to give you 21 and if you have for

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.100 
to give you 21 and if you have for
example<00:01:49.260> negative<00:01:50.260> 9<00:01:50.680> over<00:01:51.870> positive<00:01:52.870> 3

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
example negative 9 over positive 3

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.500 
example negative 9 over positive 3
negative<00:01:53.980> over<00:01:54.520> positive<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:55.120> going<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.420> be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
negative over positive is going to be

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.390 
negative over positive is going to be
negative<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.380> that's<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.770> be<00:01:56.920> negative

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
negative so that's going to be negative

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.820 
negative so that's going to be negative
3<00:01:57.640> so<00:01:58.420> at<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> end<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.080> day<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.440> one<00:01:59.620> thing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
3 so at the end of the day the one thing

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.410 
3 so at the end of the day the one thing
to<00:02:00.010> consider<00:02:00.460> or<00:02:00.640> two<00:02:00.790> things<00:02:00.970> actually<00:02:01.150> to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
to consider or two things actually to

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.270 
to consider or two things actually to
consider<00:02:01.750> are<00:02:01.930> if<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> signs<00:02:02.710> are<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.040> same

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
consider are if the signs are the same

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.700 
consider are if the signs are the same
for<00:02:03.850> both<00:02:03.909> numbers<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.870> final<00:02:05.230> result<00:02:05.500> and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
for both numbers the final result and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.770 
for both numbers the final result and
multiplying<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.580> dividing<00:02:06.610> are<00:02:07.060> positive

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
multiplying and dividing are positive

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.469 
multiplying and dividing are positive
but<00:02:08.350> if<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.950> signs<00:02:09.280> don't<00:02:09.670> match<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.330> two

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
but if the signs don't match for the two

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.330 
but if the signs don't match for the two
numbers<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.170> end<00:02:11.350> result<00:02:11.710> for<00:02:11.890> multiplying

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
numbers the end result for multiplying

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.100 
numbers the end result for multiplying
or<00:02:12.819> dividing<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.780> negative

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
or dividing is going to be negative

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
or dividing is going to be negative
so<00:02:14.770> I'm<00:02:15.100> Jimmy<00:02:15.280> Chang<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.610> that's<00:02:15.880> negative

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so I'm Jimmy Chang and that's negative

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880 
so I'm Jimmy Chang and that's negative
and<00:02:16.390> positive<00:02:16.840> rules<00:02:17.050> for<00:02:17.320> multiplication

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and positive rules for multiplication

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.790 
and positive rules for multiplication
and<00:02:18.250> division
