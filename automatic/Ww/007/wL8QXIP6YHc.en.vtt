00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
the pockets are where its thicker it
does<00:01:47.880> look<00:01:48.180> kind<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> whiter<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.070> know

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
does look kind of whiter so I don't know

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910 
does look kind of whiter so I don't know
and<00:01:50.930> if<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.140> fine<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> then

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and if you're fine with that then

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
and if you're fine with that then
they're<00:01:53.130> fine<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:54.270> aren't<00:01:54.509> high<00:01:54.720> waist

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
they're fine and these aren't high waist

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.679 
they're fine and these aren't high waist
it's<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> normal<00:01:56.159> rise<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
it's kind of like a normal rise and the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.539 
it's kind of like a normal rise and the
fit<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.869> these<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.369> I'm

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
fit of these on me really good so I'm

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.929 
fit of these on me really good so I'm
guessing<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:01.350> more<00:02:01.530> average<00:02:01.890> legs<00:02:02.340> person

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
guessing on the more average legs person

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.459 
guessing on the more average legs person
they<00:02:03.060> might<00:02:03.240> come<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.479> slightly<00:02:03.750> cropped<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
they might come up slightly cropped I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
they might come up slightly cropped I
think<00:02:05.009> that's<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.219> cigarette<00:02:05.579> pant<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.329> think

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
think that's a cigarette pant I think

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
think that's a cigarette pant I think
that<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.740> really<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> look<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that and I really like that look so I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.710 
that and I really like that look so I
those<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.590> saw<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.129> top<00:02:11.610> which<00:02:12.510> I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
those I then saw this top which I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.660 
those I then saw this top which I
thought<00:02:12.989> was<00:02:13.140> really<00:02:13.409> nice<00:02:13.829> for<00:02:14.069> Primark<00:02:14.579> I
