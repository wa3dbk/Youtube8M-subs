00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello taxi comes with the export difficult 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 because the fabian has me on facebook me 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.460
 I think yesterday a message 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 written with me and I would have one 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.710
 interesting topic vegetarians can 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.400
 slash vegan single 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.140
 amino acids such as chs or glutamine or 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.910
 creatine 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 think they are from animal 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.870
 won food 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 So very good question because that brings 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 me on a topic I have to me 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 example at tnt my thoughts made 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 For once we have from cattle 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.829
 and swine gelatin capsules now 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.399
 Just encapsulate on his cattle gelatin 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:56.239
 around the switch so that also the islam 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 religious people too 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.960
 can eat and we will 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.350
 soon who in the complete 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.720
 So we're relaunching tt 2.0 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 We will also plan another one there 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.360
 make changeover and then actually 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 switch to veggie caps plus that is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.920
 they are then made of vegetable shells 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.140
 that means that's one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.320
 history with the vegetarian and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.259
 yes, vegans have to take care of what is 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.520
 the capsule shell made 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.350
 Of course it does not matter 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 to be vegetarian or vegan and then 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.860
 just Spanish latino or gelatin 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.829
 to take in capsules 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.450
 on the one hand, on the one hand, it does 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.170
 no sense for me now for example 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.600
 or for a manufacturer for example 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.009
 fish oil or glucosamine or account 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.409
 etienne in a label or in one 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.960
 Capsule is the vegetarian origin 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.820
 to pack because then the content is then 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.439
 no longer vegetable origin 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.390
 but animal origin 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 that means that does not make any again 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.240
 Of course you can and then you can 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.009
 save a bit of money again 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.880
 just these which plus caps double 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.530
 so expensive than the normal kassel 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.180
 as normal cattle statins and those are 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.099
 ever more expensive than the pig cattle 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.390
 gelatin mixed so the normal 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.849
 hat describes a capsule 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.800
 here the vegetarians and 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.360
 vegan of course, be extremely careful because 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.730
 You must also do your own research 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.769
 make like what products are made 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.540
 Become very clear when Kreatin is it 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.370
 that is won from three amino acids 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.980
 pcs are made synthetically 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 I've just had one glutamine recently 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.750
 a protein certificate in hand 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.510
 had 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.840
 the reiff from the clubhouse that is there 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.269
 so again no animal source 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.269
 that means there have to be natural 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.730
 already the vegetarian and vegan theirs 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.880
 do homework and look like 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.930
 this whole manufacturing process there 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.610
 it does not work out with that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.799
 with your own decisions you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.220
 otherwise it did not hit you like that 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.230
 compliant 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.299
 let's just say there are actually 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.220
 things that vegetarians should vegan 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.290
 do not take such as for example 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.630
 if the capsules are the little ones 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.760
 animal no plant 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.100
 may be the vegetable origin and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 on the other hand there are of course 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.190
 food supplements 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.440
 should not be taken salmon oil 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.060
 for example or fish oils for example 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.290
 should not be taken 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.370
 that one should look if you maybe 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.959
 one of omega 3 from a source of 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 If you have a herbal case 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.470
 The herbal source should be one 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.600
 but also watch that capsule too 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.280
 from the vegetable source is here 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.780
 So vegetarians actually have to 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.430
 be careful that means i wanted to be now 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.290
 not great to give the answer 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.549
 the video 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.019
 Because I do not care about all the products 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.850
 somehow can give an answer he 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.139
 a manufacturer makes it so 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.329
 other manufacturers do that with the 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.549
 capsule cover with the content you have to 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.160
 Of course you have to have your own 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.020
 homework 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.240
 but the video was actually rather 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.580
 thought is a very good question from 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.410
 fabian he was just meant to 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.670
 vegetarian vegan if anyone has this 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.100
 decision made absolutely 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.750
 okay and absolutely not no 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.780
 Disadvantages with my opinion 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.269
 after that, of course, watch out for that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.239
 He then does not deal with such things 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.580
 maybe the moral or the ethics then 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.070
 breaks again or maybe has 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.550
 I just broke her because of me 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.510
 because now a light thrown on it 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.280
 So by and large you can 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.750
 actually a lot to lead 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.390
 right now what you want you already 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.050
 say in the pz amin creatine is not 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.120
 problem 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.880
 as I said with the capsules is one 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.140
 problem and in other things that just 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.140
 animal origin are very clear
