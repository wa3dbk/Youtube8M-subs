00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.670
 speaking of training ninjutsu let's say 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.679
 few words about the phases of learning any 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 admission or movement study of any 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.010
 admission or movement in ninjutsu can 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.670
 conditionally divided into four stages first 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.500
 phase is the addiction phase of the weapon 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.420
 just like a man acquiring a sword 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.210
 half pulls it out of its sheath 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 try sharp the film weighs it in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 hand and a few whistling sweeps 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.149
 air and to any movement ninja 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.510
 must first adapt himself to make it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.239
 its at this stage of studying for example 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.510
 punching student gets used correctly 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.570
 and it is natural for him to clench a fist 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 mastering the trajectories and so on 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.539
 the main goal is to achieve naturalness and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 relaxed movement the second phase is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.570
 the phase of combining the motion that is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.900
 combining any particular strike 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.900
 grip and so on with the movement of the legs and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.930
 full body ninjas learn correctly 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.840
 invest weight and strength moving under 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.090
 different angles back and forth and so 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 further main goal at this stage 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 is the acquisition of power and strength and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.030
 harmonious continuous execution 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030
 movements 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.150
 the third phase is the practical phase 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.160
 applications of techniques only varied 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.340
 working with a partner can bring success 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.530
 student at this stage 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 you canâ€™t learn to hit or throw 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.260
 from various positions reflecting 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.240
 various types of attacks playing 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.200
 any situations in different conditions 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.610
 outside in the forest on the stairs to the roof of the house and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.870
 so on the main goal to achieve 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.870
 feedback that is
