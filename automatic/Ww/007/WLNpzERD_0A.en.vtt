00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 or the youtube peÃ±a here manuel bad in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.849
 word in two today I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.370
 pomegranate vonn modifier and how it 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.710
 get this grenade modifier 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.100
 this grenade modifier makes the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.350
 European pairo pitt 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.860
 and maybe I do not know it to science 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.750
 the warrior can trip up and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.170
 empires the invincible 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.340
 these two I have my doubts but perovic 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.430
 If I know that the European way 100% 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.040
 sure but I know that the European 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.040
 if they are asking me this 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.890
 grenade modifier I released it a 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.260
 Dwarf bitch but I know science 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.940
 certain what will later repeat for 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.770
 third time but pitt if the European 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.790
 well now next we will examine 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.920
 the grenade modifier in question 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.820
 and here we have it 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.269
 you neither you nor the same nor we are going to 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.119
 leave it in burning grenade damage not 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.979
 the truth is very high a good year of 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.070
 burst fuze delay more or 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.009
 less normal but the message is clear 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.350
 sister is a bitch but why 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.560
 message for a grenade modifier 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.009
 because it puts me in that message so ugly and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.549
 so insulting we are not going to see it in 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.920
 action 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.330
 as always savior to try the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 pomegranate modifiers 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.580
 they are seeing that he is lying there in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.800
 a visit 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.050
 how this switch works 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.560
 grenade what they are seeing has the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.440
 granada explode from that pomegranate leaves a 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.110
 kind as thick but that starts 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 to shoot bullets and while you're 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.740
 firing bullets after pelotitas leave 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.050
 more little explosives grenades 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.210
 other more petty demands which 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.730
 Of course you can not kill with them 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.010
 perfectly this modifier of 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.340
 Grenade can get us in a mess or 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.709
 also save us from him 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.019
 but as we do not walk with much 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.330
 careful the truth is that if the most 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.819
 sure is that we end up giving one of the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.459
 small grenades that loose and we just 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.629
 let's just lie, look, look, look 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.780
 here 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.629
 there I jumped two bombs for all 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.540
 Incredible and incredible sides by 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.209
 explosion of colors and here as you 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.530
 I was saying I can get in a mess 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.190
 easily modifier 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.200
 grenades 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.030
 only me 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.890
 when talking modifier 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.340
 granada this grenade modifier 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.680
 are worth it is clear that it comes out in all 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.870
 the effects to me touched me explosively and 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.879
 I said good again great then I can 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 use it also against robots and others 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.510
 but the bad thing is that it is not very 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.640
 powerful there is in the trap of the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.180
 modifier here you are seeing me I have not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.670
 thrown in a place where the matter is 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.310
 very narrow at least six of them 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.220
 and novel that is going on there all the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.989
 while I listen to shots and here in 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.640
 crushing bone is this has left me a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.390
 grenade modifier but let's 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.819
 puntito a puntito bueno what is said comes out 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.990
 all effects for the one who recommends 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.300
 this grenade modifier 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.800
 how to recommend recommend it 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.010
 for everyone but who can 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.720
 get more savior party 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.720
 to throw two grenades for one 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.980
 this yes axton with one of your trees 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.930
 skills which when you're on stage 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.239
 of second chance you can throw a 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.760
 granada and so this type of grenade you 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.010
 can save easily, yes it is 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 recommended others could not 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.530
 get as much use or depends on whether it depends on 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.940
 the effect that comes out but good 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.910
 recommend recommending for two these two 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.190
 classes in question here yes and if we 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.129
 we put to throw many many that seems 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.280
 a shooting but let's go shooting in a 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.010
 lift many bullets in a very space 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.290
 reduced and the truth is that if they are formed 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.780
 chaos in an incredible way the bad the bad 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.639
 is that surely we end up getting 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.370
 in a mess for our own grenades 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.049
 so nothing as I always say that 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.049
 have seen me and a hug to all
