00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:12.139
 hello so even though i am you today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:17.179
 show how you can get 12-9 your 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.179
 Today we have such a simple topic 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:28.369
 12 points to another produces 9 volts 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:40.260
 well it is not so very difficult 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 You can say I collected from simple 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:51.449
 such such from the old can 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:59.600
 say carrot for every day 9 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:05.449
 live bolted 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.700
 the seams of fantasy by many so today we are 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:15.490
 in the last stage, it turns out that 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:20.479
 did not work then four to the right took me one 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:25.190
 nothing red because it is a plus 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:33.009
 sees it minus you to author exactly the same 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:36.220
 red and black three wires read 1 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:42.159
 So begin so 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.159
 connection comes from the power supply 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:51.750
 minus forest and plus minus so that she 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:56.190
 spinning was clockwise 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.590
 because of this, it already produces a little 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:06.170
 energy so can 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.170
 9 and 12 I will check so turn on our 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.690
 80 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.800
 Beginning of work 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:26.860
 so take the light bulb 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.860
 off the light 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.660
 succeeded 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:24.690
 light bulb where it turns out 9 volts 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.690
 break down cars 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.019
 and since you understood it very simple 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.519
 the scheme of this or it may last 2 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:47.010
 motor I think it is unlikely just like 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:49.159
 the law of physics is for whom you pay for 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.439
 beginners but I myself somehow 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.340
 plus I collected his peace although I knew I thought 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.840
 it is useful to someone 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.409
 thank you for your attention will be still vidio 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:07.079
 are water and cellular repair at 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:10.230
 computers still thinking and I'm someone 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.569
 helpful to someone will write comments 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.230
 Thank you all for 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.230
 goodbye
