00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.460
 On the weekend he should be really sunny again in large parts 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.740
 Germany, then 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.480
 The ideal time to go outdoors was also the week after the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.949
 reluctant to get a long finger 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.950
 the snow still on the first victory this still gray 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.930
 actually no time for gardening but whose heart failure did its 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.480
 Cutting trees now has to be done even if it is still pretty cold 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.619
 Gardening master Jose Pharma dispels all reservations about the wintry 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.569
 In the winter, the snow bounced off two acts of popularity 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.410
 The winter cut helps to build trees that grow up 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.770
 That's why this measure now sounds right at this time 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.920
 simple and obvious but just the first cut makes you free to worry 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.420
 because he decides about well and woe of the future Brooks donor yes 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.490
 but I do not know where to start now I cut them so many 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.380
 boughs 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.560
 in all directions 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.870
 which must be gone if he stops 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.650
 the oncoming lane 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.679
 this question 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.859
 Youssef Weimer answers with a simple comparison of the tree he says 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:09.450
 she is a young person and gets an education cut 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.840
 initially took 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.370
 you visit yourself completely 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.180
 which forms the framework of the tree in the next hundred years and this 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.120
 in the future, in fruit, he is probably the hand the fruit appears 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.560
 they also have to be cut into it 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 Thus, the four vocal soloists are touched Plus rent is Switzerland 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.680
 also a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.750
 fall all three people suffer and now become 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.420
 It lets you enjoy the top and the next buds 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.960
 they break out and see that 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.660
 that's right 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.280
 By doing so, I reach that steep he does not arise 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.690
 but here flat fruit is present 45 degrees is the ideal angle 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.090
 for the largest branches you grow steeper you have to spread them apart they are 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 you can think it up shallower 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.400
 So the youngest tree on the meadow got the first polish but there is 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.360
 there are still the older ones who have been on the bark for ten or more years and 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.180
 In Boppard, to remain in the picture, their stubbornness in front of them, why, again 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.520
 the question how to deal with them safe bit shot here at this water 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520
 Special camp I poor that the world or those affairs 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.259
 I do not know 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.399
 some branches come too many in my opinion 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.739
 I do not want to cut away too much because the tree should be too strong again 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.309
 remains 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.239
 But I'm also the right foot passengers leave when I am 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.309
 very much my apples started to harvest from May onwards 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.849
 that's what you're trying to do with the 12-year-olds 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.940
 serve to keep in balance constantly 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.589
 between drift and fruiting 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:54.629
 10 the shoots too long then it is too much in youth and 3d 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.039
 and that leads away from the fruit formation 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.829
 and on the other hand, it should have so much fruit 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.299
 that he does not overfruit himself 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.859
 the art of building game 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.599
 Incidentally, it applies to all types of fruit cherry apple peach beer sack 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.809
 equally 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.769
 as Joseph Weimar literally increases by the crown of 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.289
 Twelve-year-old and many a thick branch must fall, added freighters 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.569
 courage 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.679
 yes, but that's just part of where it is too tight then too 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:30.299
 these branches are removed then just the sodden and the light and air come 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.929
 other fruits 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.189
 the apple where the caring person pulls out 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.079
 he worked much faster fat circles whose biography would be significantly shorter 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.349
 cared for at a young age later a little neglected and today proud 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.719
 80 years old 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.639
 such an old gentleman is also in the meadow to cut it you have to him 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.529
 understand the part of the club makes so the essence of the old trees is that 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.460
 that the operation is close to zero 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.549
 has been going for years 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.199
 and in this way they have enough 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.759
 Fruits most states are very small but I have the situation that 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:11.439
 there was so much youth there are still still showed up with Ali goes there 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.249
 Wound healing is good 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:15.190
 the stability is good 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.870
 the structure is there then i can rejuvenate it 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.810
 and this makeover is now being experienced by the apple tree 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.840
 especially in the middle of many St formed the the underlying ones 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.750
 Smaller shade here in the Groner must therefore particularly courageous 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.469
 cut out are inlet for light and air 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.320
 a crow must be able to fly through a tree says Yousef Weimar and 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.909
 like 3 sa wants to try to implement this theorem on his remaining trees 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.639
 each cut incision a lot more light more fruits and a longer tree 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.060
