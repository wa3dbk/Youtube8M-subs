and everything like that so now I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.619 
and everything like that so now I'm
going<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.020> try<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.260> start<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.680> car<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:56.390> does

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
going to try and start the car it does

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.360 
going to try and start the car it does
start<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:57.230> starts<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:57.829> runs<00:00:57.980> just<00:00:58.280> fine

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
start it starts and runs just fine

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.330 
start it starts and runs just fine
sometimes<00:00:59.059> they<00:00:59.450> won't<00:00:59.739> watch<00:01:00.739> this<00:01:01.039> just

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
sometimes they won't watch this just

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.749 
sometimes they won't watch this just

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
again I was able to start it right up I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.899 
again I was able to start it right up I
just<00:01:12.320> wiggle<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.710> key<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.890> little<00:01:13.040> bit<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:15.909> won't

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
just wiggle the key a little bit I won't

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.670 
just wiggle the key a little bit I won't
always<00:01:17.240> do<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.869> course<00:01:18.049> I<00:01:18.200> won't<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.590> on

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
always do it of course I won't do it on

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.950 
always do it of course I won't do it on
camera<00:01:19.600> there<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:20.689> go

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
camera there you go

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.240 
camera there you go
and<00:01:21.049> all<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.350> had<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.560> do<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.860> wiggle<00:01:22.159> a<00:01:22.220> little

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
and all I had to do is wiggle a little

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.760 
and all I had to do is wiggle a little
bit<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:22.909> turned<00:01:23.119> off<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.470> don't<00:01:24.619> have

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
bit and it turned off now you don't have

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.649 
bit and it turned off now you don't have
to<00:01:24.890> replace<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.880> whole<00:01:25.909> ignition<00:01:26.479> lock

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
to replace the whole ignition lock

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.570 
to replace the whole ignition lock
cylinder<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.650> just<00:01:27.830> basically<00:01:28.159> take<00:01:28.430> this

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
cylinder you just basically take this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.969 
cylinder you just basically take this
lower<00:01:28.850> part<00:01:29.119> down<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.659> on<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.439> back<00:01:30.650> side<00:01:30.680> of

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
lower part down and on the back side of

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.710 
lower part down and on the back side of
it<00:01:31.189> is<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.729> electrical<00:01:32.150> portion<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
it is the electrical portion of the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.600 
it is the electrical portion of the
ignition<00:01:33.140> switch<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:34.189> can<00:01:34.280> remove<00:01:34.549> that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
ignition switch you can remove that

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.789 
ignition switch you can remove that
right<00:01:34.970> from<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.240> back<00:01:35.500> there<00:01:36.500> are<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.650> couple

here<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.409> replace<00:01:39.820> but<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.180> solves<00:01:41.689> a

here that you replace but this solves a

stalling just ran out of the blue so if

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.740 
stalling just ran out of the blue so if

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
you have a Honda that randomly stalls

it's an ignition switch issue remember

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.730 
it's an ignition switch issue remember
it's<00:01:58.610> just<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.939> electrical<00:01:59.390> portion<00:01:59.649> so<00:02:00.649> if

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
it's just the electrical portion so if

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.830 
it's just the electrical portion so if

good thing to check for wheel the key if
it<00:02:04.970> stalls<00:02:05.270> do<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.020> ignition<00:02:06.350> switch<00:02:06.470> forget

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950
