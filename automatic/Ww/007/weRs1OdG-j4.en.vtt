00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.390
 a person today we go 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.500
 learn how to build a light bulb 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.440
 olive oil or lamp well you go 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.630
 need the following materials a can 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.760
 of aluminum a piece of bread preference 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:31.500
 Cotton thread sewing a pair of scissors 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:36.059
 Lighter initially we'll cut 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:01:08.659
 the can through this way we will make 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:01:08.659
 scissors so that we can be made 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.320
 then with the aid of an agent 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 pass around it to build the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 ours is basically ready we go 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:48.270
 just introduce the olive oil do not wet me 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:51.130
 say ours and pulls that amount 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.130
 here we go 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.049
 obeyed our pavilion 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.920
 for this we will use here a 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:04.390
 lusa miguel being totally a piece 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.259
 cotton stick 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:15.180
 we are now introduced by 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.989
 hole passing to part of our 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:46.650
 lambari 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:46.650
 Let's put our own here 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.870
 Let's wait here. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:46.019
 the country on the 11th we'll delete them now 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:04.790
 to our praise, we observe the 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:08.270
 luminosity considered the lamp 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.270
 it works perfectly 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:17.220
 no emergency cases where you 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.890
 need a source of artificial light 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:26.100
 you may be building on your 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:45.090
 oil lamp or heavy lamp 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:48.750
 Water does not exist materials 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.600
 find an aluminum tin one 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.600
 piece of sewing to make 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.650
 difficult, but you have your 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.210
 this is another experiment in physics 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.550
 A hug and see you there
