00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.220
 to do a lot of these and I'm thin 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.269
 use the same fixture 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.730
 you can use 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.270
 what does he have when she stands under some kind of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.189
 I do not move fixed and further 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 I put such a limiter that is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.189
 it's just over the counter here and return 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.779
 my with it can be accordingly 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.779
 adjust push push and 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.320
 this is bad no. just fasten here 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.690
 here this screw is screwed on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:04.710
 distance from saw teeth 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.010
 In this distance I will put it on 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010
 wiki 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.770
 It is installed on the fobur as it were finished 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.740
 without getting 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.810
 further see why it is convenient then 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 I take 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 enough that I will cut slats 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.869
 stop moving 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.170
 I mean, from this side 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.470
 configured to limit 5 millimeters 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.450
 take out the bar here emphasis just 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 move the fixing saw off further 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.480
 again the emphasis moving abutting here in this 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.290
 screw fixing saw off 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.560
 and so you can quickly file 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.080
 main detail and not carrying books not 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.220
 measuring every time this is the distance from 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.120
 saws all the way here we fixed it 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.120
 on the other hand 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.350
 are regulated 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.350
 just measuring the distance 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.680
 that is, here are a couple of planochka owl 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:06.260
 accordingly here in this way 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:10.340
 going on and set loosened up 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:21.140
 here he rested my curtain finished 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:23.409
 food and get free which 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.579
 In this case, I use them for 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:31.609
 connections facade rank generally need 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.030
 just how calibrated what planochki 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.030
 do
