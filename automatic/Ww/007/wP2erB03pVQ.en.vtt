in<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.429> lens<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.789> something<00:01:39.119> I'll<00:01:39.929> give<00:01:40.080> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
in the lens or something I'll give you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.059 
in the lens or something I'll give you
an<00:01:40.229> idea<00:01:40.319> I<00:01:40.590> had<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.840> turn<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.080> mm

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
an idea I had it on turn it on mm

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.249 
an idea I had it on turn it on mm
extension<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:47.990> down<00:01:48.990> here

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
extension and I had it kind of down here

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.480 
extension and I had it kind of down here
the<00:01:49.470> keyboard<00:01:49.950> aimed<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.819> at<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.060> screen

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.039 

which<00:01:56.180> gave<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.689> silly<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:58.600> faded<00:01:59.600> outlook

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
which gave it that silly a faded outlook

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.600 
which gave it that silly a faded outlook
because<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.560> screen<00:02:00.799> of<00:02:00.920> course<00:02:01.100> was<00:02:01.250> tilted

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
because the screen of course was tilted

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.700 
because the screen of course was tilted
back<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:02.180> could<00:02:02.390> see<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:05.170> kind<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.259> caused<00:02:06.470> an
