00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Welcome once again, they say 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.330
 petty and tactile the last day 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
 the university in athletics 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.980
 mind you and there is the program 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.719
 always pack it went scale 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 there will be a long way to go 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.859
 there is technology we try everything 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.840
 Please bring heinrich yes 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.850
 Thank you Mr. Theo center 4 x 100-meter 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 Let's start with the season of the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 Switzerland with two ladies also at 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.080
 swiss record in lausanne were there 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.230
 namely, who and a jump out of video 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.329
 but they do not work the way they used to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.840
 positions but also two and three 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.989
 joel physically and joel sarah 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.020
 polley yes, the latter in the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.690
 single race was in use 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.039
 over 200 meters but the Swiss have 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.719
 is it not for the final 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.879
 qualified is definitely favored 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.699
 the team from ukraine with words with 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.410
 programmed with straps with gifts 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.910
 that's amazing the Ukrainian 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.289
 Team that's kitty the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.719
 First runner of the swiss team 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.100
 then as I said the two jump and 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.420
 then also comes from the canton of Vaud 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.840
 namely then comes from Lausanne 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.990
 goalie 4 x 100 meters 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.939
 with realistic consideration it will 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.780
 nothing for the Russian team here 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.000
 can be 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.429
 I 'm just curious what the ukraine 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.520
 for times a mixed team is blasting 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:38.539
 has 41 79 achieved world of jamaica 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.649
 42 42 also that a team 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.020
 So the ukraine 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.630
 you realize that has a fancy 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 smelled what the season concerns and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.720
 Maria Yemen has more than 200 meters in the last race 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.789
 Imposing really good the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.280
 americans and jamaicans 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.159
 beaten very much to their own 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.450
 Surprise, by the way, so there is something 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.920
 the caller also in view of the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.189
 Now the world cup spectator in 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.289
 Moscow we live them in the house 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.690
 deliver from the first to the 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:15.680
 Last second, of course, supports 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:18.879
 as always from maurice greene russia 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.739
 on the track 3 the usa on the track four 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:27.680
 Poland on the train five with Popovich 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.840
 Start runner members with Fiat 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.579
 the third position of ukraine 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.660
 if only reasonably good change 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.670
 then it is this 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.900
 The team is doing really well in Switzerland 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.380
 on band 7 outside the change 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.389
 is down 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.000
 Switzerland is outside Russia is 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.889
 still present and ukraine for the moment 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.419
 already in the lead 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.980
 next change this is the phase now 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.669
 for Mario Riemann 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.840
 that 's an excellent turn golfing 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.130
 Ukrainian and actually doing here 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.519
 All dress has to be the last one 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.220
 change fold on viktoria marchtrenk 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.319
 and he is also in sack and bags and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.250
 this means that ukraine is the usa in the first place 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.739
 behind it on the second position the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.650
 poland 3 extends usa 4 and the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:17.319
 time 42 76 that I only have a breath 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.200
 slower than in gates about big runs 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.879
 strong perception of Ukraine also 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.670
 currently has the hold on 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.900
 that's what they were shown high 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.030
 partly also in the ladder working 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.430
 Many other disciplines too 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.590
 some have been skinny but please 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.430
 is synonymous with big others 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.780
 events so but what overall 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.049
 the university also in the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.450
 athletics services 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.349
 that was a fine sound 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:49.569
 we have maria lemmen the 200 meters 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:51.280
 specialist in ukraine and the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.620
 Change was expandable that you have to 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.829
 quite clearly say you had so with 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.689
 her strongest runner ahead and her 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.409
 very strong then on the second 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:04.870
 position aureus short but jack farmer and 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.489
 Christian could do that in the end too 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.480
 not really nice third place 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.519
 for the university team of poland 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.319
 about 4 x 100 meters and switzerland the 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.969
 We have change since I have to run 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.280
 We can follow him closely 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.039
 not explicitly Switzerland again 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.560
 has been disqualified 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:28.389
 a change of fault looked like this 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.870
 as if already the first change 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.120
 would 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.509
 at the swiss team of the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.509
 Chinese elementary school could jump 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.860
 I think we can now with us 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.860
 the 4 x 100 meters of men 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.860
 deal with
