00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
was such a great idea to take this stuff

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.800 
was such a great idea to take this stuff
and<00:02:40.459> deconstruct<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.090> kids

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
and deconstruct it in a way so that kids

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.539 
and deconstruct it in a way so that kids
could<00:02:42.989> experience<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.980> know<00:02:44.069> almost<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
could experience it you know almost a

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.759 
could experience it you know almost a
part<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.000> time<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.659> sounds<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.620> old

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
part at a time it sounds like the old

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.069 
part at a time it sounds like the old
record<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.220> better<00:02:47.459> music<00:02:48.269> hasn't<00:02:48.629> changed

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
record but better music hasn't changed

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.380 
record but better music hasn't changed
that<00:02:49.170> much<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.560> technology<00:02:49.950> has<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:51.239> can

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
that much but technology has you can

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.910 
that much but technology has you can
tell<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.750> old<00:02:51.870> song<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.379> here<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.799> new

tell the old song is here and the new
one<00:02:53.129> is<00:02:53.420> much<00:02:54.420> closer<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.230> really

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
one is much closer to you and really

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.899 
one is much closer to you and really
