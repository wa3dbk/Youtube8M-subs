 realize how many was not authorized 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.200
 What would this be? 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.390

 that went with total 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.630
 so how computer crimes here she already 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.180

 On that account, what I'm going to do, I'm going to give 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.740
 here neither watching will enter the other only 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.990
 I played here, that's what I understood. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.540
 in this account that this 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.509
 water home games of humor 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.220
 to unitau amish nintendo until then then 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.120
 you will see that you are only having 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.099
 access to various games 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.799
 they will play here let's see what happens 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.560
 he will load and then he will abiec oo 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.650
 I do not want to play bone, let's just have it. 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.760
 close and what happens is this is a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.220
 process that I did to share 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.510
 My account with this account that only 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.370
 has to be a process that both have 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 what to do then you will have to get 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.989
 on your account coming configurations 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.349
 You go in family sharing 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:41.980
 authorize computer and will select here 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.390
 oo, and you give an ok understood and it's 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.370
 So what are you doing? 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.720
 only the staff what happens as it is 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 I'm going to go if I have a friend. 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.859
 that the use of type 1 memory in 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.450
 another city, how do we go there? 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.170
 does well because you two sectors 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.700
 second you can pass without the other 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.950
 but this is something that no matter how much the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.480
 Increases are extremely reliable 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.269
 I recommend that you take a lot of 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.060
 careful to always pass something that 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.859
 I really enjoy what the pole is. 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.579
 My tip for you guys meet 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.349
 here is smartass come here O aunt saw it 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.810
 this program 15 can search the goal 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.840
 and if they find the free beauty program 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.310
 he here he basically you go 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.269
 remote access to the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.430
 computer 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.400
 then your friend will be able to enter 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.500
 on your pc 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.379
 he will be able to log in and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.780
 His password on steam will go there. 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.389
 desktop height and now 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.790
 I'm going to explain to you guys that 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.340
 the other little things that are in the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.449
 between the fan's share 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.239
 what is not this 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.739
 the first thing personal if you if you 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.269
 is playing for example a game of mine 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.980
 understood I 'm sharing with 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.470
 Who are you watching a video? 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.629
 My game and you used the hack is what 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.590
 it happens with the ranking you went the fox 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.900
 here in the face 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.760
 you're going to get banned and it's not just you and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.349
 You're cute too, because the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.930
 game was not playing on my account 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.329
 so take care especially 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.819
 sharing multiplayer games that okay 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.590
 This can be a problem for you as 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.359
 he chose very well who you go 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 share your accounts in staff 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.579
 so you have to be careful to 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.949
 This way you do not end up being banned 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.460
 in someone else's population and touched 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.630
 siren is 3 of mother cards but anyway 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.210
 other thing the staff is as follows 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.980
 here there are games such as 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.930
 service seems like it counts 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.930
 on this account does not appear but for example 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.510
 the far cry 3 in a game that when you 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.360
 how do you start the game and will open to the 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.640
 claim service is to their source of 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.180
 ubisoft understood then it will open 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.730
 That's it 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.340
 this type of game is and it does not work 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.880
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.350
 You 're making a rental chek, I 'm going. 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.360
 come back here again ready to show 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.800
 one last thing for you is the staff 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.230
 So here's nothing new in my account. 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.960
 main thing is that the last thing he 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.970
 I wanted to show you guys, see sting. 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.100
 family and sharing settings 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.260
 manage a family mode will load 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.990
 here is what you can share 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.880
 the games you choose or all 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.770
 games and understood I recommend that you 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.020
 only put games that you choose 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.280
 and you leave out it will be a games 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.800
 multiplayer time and you can only have 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.690
 these games also to play online 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.660
 reminding staff that two people did not 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.750
 can play the same game at the same time 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.850
 using schin and then type so car 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.550
 every time you will get a warning if for example 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.680
 if you are one and what you have playing and 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.150
 Do you want to go into the same room? 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.220
 I will not play one of the 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.830
 two will serve out here that this is not 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.390
 It's going to be good, we'll go. I'll go. 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.540
 leave only games they have chosen 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.840
 continue here and then we can go and I 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.830
 I want to share what a game will 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.220
 dead space 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.980
 omar Coêlho milestone is another game fac 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.110
 loses will not appear on the list and 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.150
 It's going to shrink death, it 's you, too. 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.820
 Continue 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.520
 he asked for your code here is one 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.860
 password but in case it is not 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.870
 thing that I'm going to vote using 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.160
 I'm just going to leave because this 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.750
 Account is an account that tests only for 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.220

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.350
 so guys I hope you guys have 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.570
 liked the video beauty that would show 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.000
 for you this function in which you found very 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.890
 but what's here on steam is and I have 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.050
 sure that this function will be 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.370
 helping there many of you understood 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.780
 and that's it 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.300
 So if you liked the video that are the 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.130
 cases of a fan favorite is 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.990
 more doubts about this type is commonly 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.520
 there is also injury 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.250
 the videos of our extinct guide 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.620
 Calm then the staff went by arm 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.620
 the goal is always more shui
