00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
huge to my hand up here this is at least

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.969 
huge to my hand up here this is at least
as<00:05:16.310> thick<00:05:16.460> as<00:05:16.610> my<00:05:16.760> thumb<00:05:17.530> that's<00:05:18.530> only<00:05:18.620> half<00:05:18.949> of

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
as thick as my thumb that's only half of

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.000 
as thick as my thumb that's only half of
it<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:20.330> these<00:05:20.539> two<00:05:20.900> pieces<00:05:21.169> go<00:05:21.530> together<00:05:21.590> and

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
it so these two pieces go together and

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.270 
it so these two pieces go together and
make<00:05:22.159> the<00:05:22.310> tail<00:05:23.500> it's<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.560> big<00:05:24.710> prehensile

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
make the tail it's a big prehensile

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.779 
make the tail it's a big prehensile
looking<00:05:25.760> thing<00:05:26.680> that<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.800> very<00:05:27.830> cool<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:28.699> looks

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
looking thing that is very cool it looks

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.399 
looking thing that is very cool it looks
like<00:05:28.940> a<00:05:29.000> giant<00:05:29.300> centipede<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.050> could<00:05:30.349> think

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
like a giant centipede I could think

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.629 
like a giant centipede I could think
it's<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.650> cool<00:05:30.860> conversion<00:05:31.370> to<00:05:31.430> do<00:05:31.550> with<00:05:31.669> that

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
it's a cool conversion to do with that

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.899 
it's a cool conversion to do with that
this<00:05:34.639> thing<00:05:35.919> goes<00:05:36.919> on<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.220> end<00:05:37.310> of<00:05:37.400> that<00:05:37.460> and

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
this thing goes on the end of that and

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.939 
this thing goes on the end of that and
that<00:05:38.120> suppose<00:05:38.539> up<00:05:38.690> with<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.930> bait<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.650> bottom

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
that suppose up with the bait the bottom

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.220 
that suppose up with the bait the bottom
is<00:05:39.979> all<00:05:40.099> flat<00:05:40.400> there

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.230 

so<00:05:46.230> here's<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.470> other<00:05:46.560> screw<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:48.090> head

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
so here's the other screw of a head

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.870 
so here's the other screw of a head
pieces<00:05:48.450> that's<00:05:48.990> really<00:05:49.290> cool<00:05:49.550> how<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.610> head

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
pieces that's really cool how the head

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.520 
pieces that's really cool how the head
fits<00:05:51.150> together<00:05:51.330> these<00:05:51.690> two<00:05:51.750> pieces<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.410> that

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
fits together these two pieces and that

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.470 
fits together these two pieces and that
on<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:53.040> you<00:05:53.160> can<00:05:53.340> switch<00:05:53.580> it<00:05:53.610> for<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:54.000> movie

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
on that you can switch it for a movie

these<00:06:15.300> are<00:06:15.420> just<00:06:15.450> meeting<00:06:15.990> I<00:06:16.670> guess<00:06:17.670> they<00:06:17.790> use

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
these are just meeting I guess they use

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.080 
these are just meeting I guess they use
them<00:06:18.000> for<00:06:18.030> digging<00:06:18.720> through<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.020> air

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
them for digging through the air

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.650 
them for digging through the air
tunneling<00:06:22.520> there's<00:06:23.520> one<00:06:23.550> two<00:06:24.150> three<00:06:24.800> four

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
tunneling there's one two three four

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.590 
tunneling there's one two three four
four<00:06:27.660> seven<00:06:27.720> thousand<00:06:28.440> downs<00:06:29.000> but<00:06:30.000> you<00:06:30.390> can

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
four seven thousand downs but you can

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.970 
four seven thousand downs but you can
swap<00:06:31.590> between<00:06:32.330> Trigon<00:06:33.330> ones<00:06:33.600> so<00:06:34.230> try<00:06:34.650> run<00:06:34.830> one

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 
swap between Trigon ones so try run one

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.400 
swap between Trigon ones so try run one
to<00:06:35.070> be<00:06:35.280> this<00:06:35.490> one<00:06:35.640> is<00:06:35.760> a<00:06:35.790> big<00:06:35.990> this<00:06:36.990> one<00:06:37.170> and

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
to be this one is a big this one and

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.200 
to be this one is a big this one and
this<00:06:37.500> one<00:06:37.560> this<00:06:37.740> one<00:06:38.340> in<00:06:38.790> the<00:06:39.390> molokai<00:06:40.230> smaller

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
this one this one in the molokai smaller

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.570 
this one this one in the molokai smaller
setting<00:06:42.210> town<00:06:42.390> so<00:06:42.660> if<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.840> got<00:06:42.960> one<00:06:43.370> and<00:06:44.370> going
