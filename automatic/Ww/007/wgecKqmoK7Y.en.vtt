chain<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.309> our<00:00:50.460> hook<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.850> yarn<00:00:51.180> over<00:00:51.329> we'll

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
chain from our hook so yarn over we'll

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
chain from our hook so yarn over we'll
count<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:52.320> three<00:00:52.879> four<00:00:53.879> five<00:00:54.239> six<00:01:01.280> then

count one two three four five six then

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
count one two three four five six then
we'll<00:01:02.399> start<00:01:02.609> our<00:01:02.730> repeat<00:01:03.180> by<00:01:03.210> doing<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.840> chain

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we'll start our repeat by doing a chain

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.550 
we'll start our repeat by doing a chain
three<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:05.299> two<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.250> three<00:01:09.409> then<00:01:10.409> we're

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
three so one two and three then we're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890

going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.070> our<00:01:11.100> cluster<00:01:11.790> four<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> do

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
going to do our cluster four so to do

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to do our cluster four so to do
this<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:14.700> three<00:01:15.210> double<00:01:15.390> crochets

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this we will do three double crochets

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.530 
this we will do three double crochets
over<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> stem<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.580> double<00:01:18.000> crochet<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
over the stem of the double crochet that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
over the stem of the double crochet that
we've<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.049> created<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.790> here

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we've just created this one right here

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
we've just created this one right here
and<00:01:21.890> as<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.880> work<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.420> we're<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.380> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and as we work these we're only going to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
and as we work these we're only going to
work<00:01:25.920> through<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> first<00:01:26.670> two<00:01:27.030> loops<00:01:27.060> so

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
work through the first two loops so

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.960 
work through the first two loops so
we'll<00:01:28.049> leave<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.409> loop<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.890> yarn<00:01:29.850> over

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.060 

so<00:01:38.570> I'm<00:01:38.690> starting<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.200> new<00:01:39.230> double<00:01:39.680> crochet

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
so I'm starting a new double crochet

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.750 
so I'm starting a new double crochet
here<00:01:40.460> with<00:01:40.670> each<00:01:40.880> set<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:43.340> is<00:01:43.460> going<00:01:43.640> to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
here with each set and this is going to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.700 
here with each set and this is going to
give<00:01:43.910> me<00:01:45.100> four<00:01:46.100> loops<00:01:46.370> on<00:01:46.610> my<00:01:46.670> hook<00:01:47.620> then<00:01:48.620> I'm

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
give me four loops on my hook then I'm

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.650 
give me four loops on my hook then I'm
going<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:48.950> do<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.430> more<00:01:49.460> double<00:01:50.060> crochet<00:01:50.450> but

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
going to do one more double crochet but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.660 
going to do one more double crochet but
I'm<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.050> do<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.350> two<00:01:51.800> chains<00:01:52.190> away

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
I'm going to do this two chains away

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.330 
I'm going to do this two chains away
from<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.240> stem<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:53.780> we're<00:01:53.900> skip<00:01:54.170> two<00:01:54.470> yarn

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
from this stem so we're skip two yarn

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.500 
from this stem so we're skip two yarn
over<00:01:55.670> insert<00:01:56.390> my<00:01:57.200> hook<00:01:57.820> draw<00:01:58.820> through<00:01:59.270> and

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
over insert my hook draw through and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.030 
over insert my hook draw through and
we're<00:01:59.630> only<00:01:59.690> going<00:01:59.900> to<00:01:59.990> finish<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.770> first

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
we're only going to finish the first

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.800 
we're only going to finish the first
part<00:02:01.370> of<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.120> we'll<00:02:02.300> draw<00:02:02.480> through<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
part of this so we'll draw through the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.470 
part of this so we'll draw through the
first<00:02:03.020> two<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:04.040> gives<00:02:04.220> me<00:02:04.370> five<00:02:04.760> loops<00:02:05.120> on<00:02:05.300> my

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
first two that gives me five loops on my

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.010 
first two that gives me five loops on my
hook

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
hook

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.750 
hook
then<00:02:06.680> we'll<00:02:06.830> yarn<00:02:07.070> over<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.370> draw<00:02:07.580> through

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
then we'll yarn over and draw through

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.450 
then we'll yarn over and draw through
all<00:02:08.210> five<00:02:08.810> loops<00:02:09.820> like<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:12.250> okay<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.370> we're

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
all five loops like so okay and we're

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.430 
all five loops like so okay and we're
going<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> repeat<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.210> sequence<00:02:14.510> until<00:02:15.290> we

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
going to repeat this sequence until we

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.330 
going to repeat this sequence until we
reach<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.980> last<00:02:17.500> two<00:02:18.500> chains<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:19.100> our<00:02:19.250> row<00:02:21.340> or

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
reach the last two chains in our row or

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.490 
reach the last two chains in our row or
when<00:02:22.520> we<00:02:22.640> reach<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.000> last<00:02:23.180> two<00:02:23.540> chains<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.170> our

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
when we reach the last two chains in our

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.490 
when we reach the last two chains in our
row<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:25.070> are<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.700> chain<00:02:26.060> three<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:29.500> then

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
row we are going to chain three and then

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:49.500 
row we are going to chain three and then
we<00:02:30.650> will<00:02:30.830> work<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.490> cluster<00:02:32.150> four<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:36.560> usual

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.630 

but<00:02:49.900> we're<00:02:50.019> going<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.170> work<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.590> last<00:02:51.159> double
