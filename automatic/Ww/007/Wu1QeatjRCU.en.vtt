00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.879
 hello friends that such a good welcome to 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.219
 this new video in this tutorial I'm going 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.880
 to teach one thing that many of 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.329
 you want to know and that is going to 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.820
 like it very much I guarantee it good this 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.589
 video I'm going ahead I'll try 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.230
 about the memory of samsung galaxy and 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.440
 then I tell you how you already know the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 samsung galaxy alone has 178 megabytes 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.540
 of internal memory the truth is a 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.149
 quite limited memory and that in addition 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.980
 It limits all those people who 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.559
 like to have what are many 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.989
 applications not many games all 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.030
 these things so what do you want to install 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.949
 in what is memory and only 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.550
 they install in internal memory then 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.890
 because it limits you a lot and you can not 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.530
 have all the applications so that a 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.719
 you would like to have then as 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.330
 you will know there is a way to be able to pass 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.550
 all the applications but some 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.229
 applications from the internal memory to the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.140
 external memory what would the card be 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.390
 sd is a very simple way or is it a 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.890
 process that has no complication like 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.890
 and you are going here adjustments 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.000
 Applications 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.189
 administer applications and you are 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.630
 connect with this for example I'm going to 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.830
 give the first application that I have 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.160
 battery short widget 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.350
 and as you see I get restricted 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.730
 option to move to sd card so it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.320
 this application could not move it 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.500
 for example we are going to go to another 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.610
 twitter application as you see me 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.570
 occupies 11.29 megabytes a lot 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.090
 regarding the memory that this 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.150
 terminal as you see either left me or be 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.010
 is restricted which is what happens 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.960
 most applications are not 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.000
 movable only you can move 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.520
 applications to external memory only 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.440
 those that are mobile non-movable 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.510
 you can move for this there is a 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.750
 lots of applications with an interface 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.240
 very good such but they do exactly 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.430
 the same thing that just taught you but 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.130
 Today in this video I am going to teach you 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.680
 how to spend absolutely all 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.660
 user applications of memory 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.620
 internal to external memory and when 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.050
 I say all are all or we are going to pass 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 what are all the applications to the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.100
 external memory or the sd card 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.770
 man as long as you have a 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.410
 sd card more or less in conditions 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.340
 at least 4 gigabytes to make it more 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.340
 or less good 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.590
 the application that we are going to use is 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.210
 called titanium backup I do not know if the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.240
 you will know 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.400
 to execute it because you have to be 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.440
 root users or to have rooted the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.930
 phone if you do not know I 'm going to leave you 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.040
 a link in a video that I explain and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.860
 there will be no problem 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.780
 You can download the application 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.120
 perfectly from the play store though 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.579
 there are two versions one for payment and one for 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.310
 a free one is worth to be downloaded 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.750
 is the free version you have good me 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.720
 I do not have downloaded anymore I have it here 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.549
 titanium baku good first of all 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.120
 tell you that as you can see it has come to me 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.790
 here this disc yes that says it was 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.889
 little free storage space with 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.540
 which is to erase the applications I 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.790
 I'm personally fed up with myself 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.660
 come out this thing not because you look with the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.530
 applications that I have 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.600
 that is from here I have installed myself 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.880
 nothing but you are the truth then I 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.760
 memory seems quite limited 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.420
 so then we get into the 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 titanium backup 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
 this is not going to be worth 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.950
 because as you already know the titanium beats 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.849
 It has a lot of utilities but 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.010
 today we are going to show you in this 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.040
 ok then we're going to give you here 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.019
 we will often give lots 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.480
 and well, as you can see, the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.670
 different options utilities you have 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.000
 this application we are going to go 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.879
 until this one that moves move integrate and 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.709
 As you can see there are three sub options 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.209
 first would be to move applications 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.590
 user to the sd card 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.030
 the second move apps the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.949
 user the phone memory the 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.139
 third integrate updates of 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.820
 application of system in long us 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.490
 we are going to focus on the first one 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.340
 we are going to give to do and good as you see 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.979
 here all the applications come out 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.139
 that are not movable that are not movable 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.600
 and that if they are mobile or all for 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.390
 happen 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.390
 as you have seen before I tried 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.730
 move it is the twitter application to 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.340
 the external memory and as you see there was no 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.770
 came out restricted the option and could not 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.300
 do it then so you see and to 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.890
 that is not a very long process 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.450
 I'm going to pass the twitter application to 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.400
 what is external memory so that 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.960
 see how everything works once 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.720
 have selected the applications that 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.500
 you want to pass here give to this to this 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.050
 button where do you do it we give it and you see 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.870
 It puts moving permissions have been granted 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.620
 of superuser 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.620
 and good 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.659
 Well, as you can see, if we come here 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:22.269
 it tells us finished movement task 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.990
 perfect then to check it then 

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:27.990
 very simple we come to settings 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.100
 Applications 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.100
 manage applications 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.310
 and we look for the application d 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.310
 twiter 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.340
 here we have it, you know, you all do not 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.830
 we give 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.440
 and as you see tells us the option to move 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.830
 on the phone or we already have the 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.440
 application in external memory what 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.000
 comes to be the sd card you have seen 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.600
 it's a fairly simple process and 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.050
 pretty useful is worth then this would be 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.470
 anything goes, you can spend all you can 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.320
 pass the ones you want and nothing this 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.030
 advantages have then you will see advantages 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.740
 that you can have all the 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.110
 applications that you want man always 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.479
 and when you have a sd card like 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.450
 I 've told you before, good give at least 4 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:23.330
 gb and you can also install custom room 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.639
 it is very many layers of what 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.070
 what is personalization 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.440
 ok so they take up too much memory 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.360
 internal then what happens has happened to me 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.010
 many times that installed custom room and 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.289
 I had to remove the rom because 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.240
 occupied a lot of internal memory because with 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:41.750
 this can be solved 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.420
 good guys this has been for today 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:48.410
 all forgive everything for today 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.930
 and nothing to tell you one thing please that is 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.300
 that when it comes to contacting me, it's worth 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.180
 to be able to send me a suggestion 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.620
 ask a comment I beg you for 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.200
 please do it through twitter 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.570
 since I log in every day 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.100
