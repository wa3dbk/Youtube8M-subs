 such as bottles because there is manadja terra company and this is the one of 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.990

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.290
 this time and in the meantime I wonder what will be the next thing 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.290
 hannah montana 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.759

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.249
 what none of the moms 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:57.230
 do you know why google does not work as well and well apparently one 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.169
 of the main reasons a bad code and her name is bullish 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.379
 thinnings solange charet ayase the chief artificer n 2 world one of the reasons 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.309
 of google's success comes from the free land and sausages allows the 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:11.150
 employees 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.150
 so in his book editions serge simard hayastan barely demonstrate 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.230
 this is also allow the engineers to end of the line of sight work because 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.589
 according to him the ice that is in the fish we will try your brain 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.589
 more elastic and adel absorption of nutrients 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.379
 I do not know if it's true niche bad I'll vote a big turn we're 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.519
 to five minutes to see 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.380
 and 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.380
 decidedly the marriage proposals which is rather simple 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.489
 but we know the internet and new technologies he tells me he 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.689
 is a cop constantly about our lives 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.119
 even on romanticism 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:58.059
 the evidence is with the airline sector ba an example will ask for it in marriage to 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.329
 using a box of 3 to 0 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.199
 I say it's no comment, it just found that 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.689
 it shabelle 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.379
 it's nothing more than me I do not find it especially romantic but 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.120
 good I still hope some phenomena from the Mass a ring to the 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.519
 master hand by the afp endangered borough 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519

 vinyl and siege role was placed a gear earlier strange nothing being 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.199
 however, it's not hard to get some exercise done at toeda's waseda university 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.399
 is at the origin of the current development of this invention 

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:41.669
 intended to improve the mobility of the elderly and no yes 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.460
 a new lunar robot 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.540
 perfect for grannies supersonic standards 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.340
 trial 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.810
 and the years after today's missions is not a news item that's top 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.199
 hallucinatory 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.930
 even if he had a last quarter of 15 years 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.300
 murdered his father with a bullet in the head so yes unfortunately it's 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.259
 not the first time we see something like this my side the following 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.710
 he explained the motives for the murder 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.060
 mons's station simply said he hoisted his father because these 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.400
 police had denied him access to the internet after finding the words 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.340
 suicidal that his son had to close this text so it's coming home one day 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.110
 of work 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.139
 what mystery clears up the misfortune of finding his son 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.639
 on the stairs of the christian family home staircase and at the 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.990
 Navy waiting to get back to life 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.680
 in today's day with his men are rather sad and regret his 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.360
 dad 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.639
 but a pity for him he will be judged as an adult because responsible for a 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.870
 premeditated murder like what you have to think twice 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.800
 even when you are a psychopath you avoid talking too much about your experience 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.110
 it's a new design choice and tomorrow if we cut delicate
