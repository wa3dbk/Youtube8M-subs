one out like that and down like there
that<00:02:42.360> would<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.950> maybe<00:02:44.510> even<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.630> like

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that would be a maybe even more like

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that yeah that would be a okay yeah it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.420 
that yeah that would be a okay yeah it
doesn't<00:02:48.209> connect<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.690> uh<00:02:49.500> okay<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.280> makes

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
doesn't connect to uh okay that makes

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.670 
doesn't connect to uh okay that makes
sense<00:02:50.519> yeah<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.180> would<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.680> that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
sense yeah that that would be a that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
it's a giant castle it doesn't deserve

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.130 
it's a giant castle it doesn't deserve
like<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.340> little<00:02:59.610> that<00:03:00.420> little<00:03:00.480> glow<00:03:00.870> stone

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
like that little that little glow stone

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.170 
like that little that little glow stone
but<00:03:01.980> up<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.489> actually<00:03:02.849> have<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> giant

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
but up here we actually have a giant

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.600 
but up here we actually have a giant
glowstone<00:03:03.540> ball<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.049> it's<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.069> sphere<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.519> I'm

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
glowstone ball and it's a sphere and I'm

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.979 
glowstone ball and it's a sphere and I'm
not<00:03:05.730> too<00:03:05.910> good<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.120> sphere<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.630> doesn't<00:03:06.870> look

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
not too good with sphere so doesn't look

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.570 
not too good with sphere so doesn't look
the<00:03:07.110> best<00:03:07.319> but<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.910> does<00:03:09.360> look<00:03:09.390> cool<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.580> I

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
the best but it does look cool and I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.860 
the best but it does look cool and I
think<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:12.030> cool<00:03:12.180> overlooking<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.720> city

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
think it's cool overlooking the city

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.449 
think it's cool overlooking the city
next<00:03:13.830> what<00:03:13.950> you're<00:03:14.040> going<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.220> I'll<00:03:14.310> worry

next what you're going to I'll worry
about<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.760> your<00:03:14.970> moat<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.019> don't

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200

actually<00:03:16.410> have<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.890> one<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.099> think<00:03:17.400> they

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
actually have to have one I think they

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.160 
actually have to have one I think they
look<00:03:17.640> pretty<00:03:17.670> bad<00:03:18.150> i<00:03:18.180> tried<00:03:18.660> making<00:03:18.959> one

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
look pretty bad i tried making one

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.039 
look pretty bad i tried making one
blowing<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.680> up<00:03:19.829> with<00:03:20.010> TNT<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.630> you're

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
blowing out up with TNT but if you're

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.300 
blowing out up with TNT but if you're
going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> build<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.500> by<00:03:22.590> hand<00:03:22.829> without<00:03:22.980> tea

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
going to build it by hand without tea

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.240 
going to build it by hand without tea
then<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.030> would<00:03:24.120> look<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:24.359> nicer<00:03:24.510> because

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
then it would look a lot nicer because

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.650 
then it would look a lot nicer because
you<00:03:26.250> need<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.459> play<00:03:26.609> place<00:03:27.120> down<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.450> water

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
you need to play place down the water

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.009 
you need to play place down the water
first<00:03:27.959> before<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.530> actually<00:03:28.709> place<00:03:29.040> down<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
first before you actually place down the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.660 
first before you actually place down the
fort<00:03:31.019> before<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.410> like<00:03:31.859> take<00:03:32.220> out<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.489> rest

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
fort before you like take out the rest

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
fort before you like take out the rest
of<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> because<00:03:33.329> placing<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.709> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
of it because placing it just on the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.849 
of it because placing it just on the
sides<00:03:35.040> makes<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.670> look<00:03:35.819> terrible<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.600> i<00:03:37.109> don't

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
sides makes it look terrible and i don't

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.680 
sides makes it look terrible and i don't
i<00:03:38.010> don't<00:03:38.040> even<00:03:38.250> recommend<00:03:38.730> making<00:03:39.269> them<00:03:39.510> out

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
i don't even recommend making them out

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
i don't even recommend making them out
but<00:03:40.440> if<00:03:40.709> you're<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.280> make<00:03:41.370> one<00:03:41.640> make

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
but if you're going to make one make

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.280 
but if you're going to make one make
sure<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.359> put<00:03:42.480> down<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.690> water<00:03:42.870> first<00:03:43.109> then

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
sure you put down the water first then

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.860 
sure you put down the water first then
destroy<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.829> blocks<00:03:44.600> next<00:03:45.600> you're<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.810> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
destroy the blocks next you're going to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.610 
destroy the blocks next you're going to
want<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.049> worry<00:03:46.290> about<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.709> your<00:03:47.190> opening<00:03:47.579> and

this<00:03:49.620> looks<00:03:49.859> really<00:03:50.160> bad<00:03:50.430> I'm<00:03:50.760> not<00:03:50.880> gonna<00:03:51.060> lie

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
this looks really bad I'm not gonna lie

this looks really bad I'm not gonna lie
I<00:03:51.900> didn't<00:03:52.380> put<00:03:52.500> too<00:03:52.739> much<00:03:52.859> time<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.190> effort

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
I didn't put too much time and effort

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.849 
I didn't put too much time and effort
into<00:03:53.700> making<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.540> would<00:03:54.930> probably<00:03:55.079> make<00:03:55.500> a

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
into making this I would probably make a

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.610 
into making this I would probably make a
different<00:03:56.340> like<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.819> tower<00:03:57.180> thing<00:03:57.569> see<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
different like a tower thing see like I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.590 
different like a tower thing see like I
have<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.829> tower<00:03:59.100> here<00:03:59.430> i<00:03:59.459> would<00:03:59.730> even<00:04:00.389> though<00:04:00.569> i

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
have a tower here i would even though i

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.360 
have a tower here i would even though i
have<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.410> inside<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.739> any<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.160> my<00:04:02.280> other

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370

have it on the inside of any of my other
walls<00:04:02.639> i<00:04:02.910> might<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.389> fix<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.440> one<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.950> make

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
walls i might like fix this one to make

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.759 
walls i might like fix this one to make
it<00:04:05.220> actually<00:04:05.420> tower<00:04:06.420> down<00:04:06.690> here<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.079> match<00:04:07.319> the

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
it actually tower down here to match the

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.990 
it actually tower down here to match the
other<00:04:07.889> side<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.250> don't<00:04:08.400> know<00:04:08.459> what<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.609> do<00:04:08.700> right

but yeah I don't know I'm not too good
with<00:04:23.310> open<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:23.760> could<00:04:23.909> make<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.120> like<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.260> a

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
with open you could make a like a like a

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.020 
with open you could make a like a like a
sand

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
sand

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.240

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
I know piston-like portcullis like worth

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.090 
I know piston-like portcullis like worth
it<00:04:32.460> word<00:04:32.730> like<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.270> pull<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.510> lever<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.100> like

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
it word like you pull a lever and like

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
the sand falls down and triggers some

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.050 
the sand falls down and triggers some
other<00:04:38.250> think<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.520> don't<00:04:38.669> know<00:04:38.730> how<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.910> make

that's<00:04:55.169> why<00:04:55.320> i<00:04:55.350> didn't<00:04:55.590> make<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.950> makes

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
that's why i didn't make it that makes

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.340 
that's why i didn't make it that makes
sense<00:04:56.520> yeah<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.840> doesn't<00:04:58.020> look<00:04:58.200> too

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
sense yeah that that doesn't look too

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.130 
sense yeah that that doesn't look too
good<00:04:58.970> anyway<00:04:59.970> Oh<00:05:02.210> towers<00:05:03.210> right<00:05:03.419> these<00:05:03.960> are

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
good anyway Oh towers right these are

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.020 
good anyway Oh towers right these are
about<00:05:04.320> these<00:05:04.680> towers<00:05:05.040> are<00:05:05.160> about<00:05:05.400> nine<00:05:05.700> in

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
about these towers are about nine in

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.810 
about these towers are about nine in
diameter<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.020> these<00:05:07.140> are<00:05:07.320> about<00:05:07.530> this<00:05:08.370> one<00:05:08.580> is

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
diameter and these are about this one is

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.430 
diameter and these are about this one is
like<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.930> think<00:05:10.380> 17<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.700> um<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.780> would<00:05:12.900> probably

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
like I think 17 so um you would probably

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.440 
like I think 17 so um you would probably
have<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.860> staircase<00:05:14.190> inside<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.300> you

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
have a staircase inside so that you

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.530 
have a staircase inside so that you
could<00:05:15.570> reach<00:05:16.470> these<00:05:16.800> uh<00:05:17.220> these<00:05:18.000> are<00:05:18.210> all<00:05:18.390> empty

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
could reach these uh these are all empty

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.790 
could reach these uh these are all empty
by<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.870> way<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> mean<00:05:19.320> there's<00:05:19.470> nothing

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
by the way I mean there's nothing

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.880 
by the way I mean there's nothing
there's<00:05:20.790> nothing<00:05:20.880> there's<00:05:21.650> there's<00:05:22.650> nothing

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
there's nothing there's there's nothing

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.840 
there's nothing there's there's nothing
inside<00:05:23.010> oh<00:05:23.330> there's<00:05:24.330> nothing<00:05:24.540> inside<00:05:24.690> them<00:05:24.960> um

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
inside oh there's nothing inside them um

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.280 
inside oh there's nothing inside them um
you<00:05:26.850> could<00:05:26.970> make<00:05:27.120> some<00:05:27.300> great<00:05:27.570> mob<00:05:27.780> traps<00:05:28.110> in

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
you could make some great mob traps in

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.290 
you could make some great mob traps in
there<00:05:28.440> but<00:05:28.800> other<00:05:29.460> than<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.970> might<00:05:30.150> want

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
there but other than that you might want

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.510 
there but other than that you might want
to<00:05:30.389> fill<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.600> in<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:31.050> was<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:31.950> is<00:05:32.130> just<00:05:32.160> a

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
to fill it in I was just this is just a

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.790 
to fill it in I was just this is just a
this<00:05:32.820> is<00:05:33.540> just<00:05:33.690> like<00:05:33.750> an<00:05:33.960> exoskeleton<00:05:34.650> there's

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
this is just like an exoskeleton there's

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.620 
this is just like an exoskeleton there's
nothing<00:05:35.070> inside<00:05:35.280> these<00:05:35.729> towers<00:05:36.270> there's

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630
