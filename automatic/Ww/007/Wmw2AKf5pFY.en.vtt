00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.530
 good here is 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:13.030
 sorry we are also going to play the portal 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.190
 we are 4 right now it is very difficult 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.640
 difficult to find the game where you are 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.140
 more than 2 and right now we are 4 something that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.710
 At least 100 have not played 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.010
 here and good what are you to him I am the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.970
 that the second one comes out the first that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.470
 yours 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.470
 I had a little 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.470
 what to talk about 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.260
 but when you do 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.470
 we are very bad by the way 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.260
 when I estimate I have it here great 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.260
 value 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 outside 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 it is less and less moving material 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
 waiting for my mistake is reading me uncle 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.710
 you are reading me 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.510
 during these days you are not asked for the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.040
 ball 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.040
 but from my very long fear 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.710
 and the background music that god 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 I'm changing 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.290
 come I do not lose it yet I do not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.290
 I lose 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.130
 Here we must win team 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.990
 you have to win as a team the first 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.990
 we will continue waiting 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.219
 waiting to be waiting 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.640
 but good to say also that the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.640
 graphics uploaded a quality video and the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.950
 people told me that the graphics videos 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 uploaded to youtube has a lot but 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.800
 Yes, they are a true past in the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.800
 model console 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.620
 the truth is the moment is cement 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.750
 but good 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 and I hope he wins 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.640
 the music of little 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:53.970
 I do not know what to stop this now you 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.970
 it will look like the philharmonic mother of mine 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.820

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.820

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.069
 and here 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.230
 something about me or her 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.860
 two 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.370
 We are three little group here at 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 last 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:45.549
 not out 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.329
 in these you buy the consoles 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.519
 disable begin to be playing 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.709
 because if things are going to happen to us like that and it's 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.219
 that the 500 recognizes the post and is going to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:02.549
 let do absolutely nothing then 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.549
 what we are commenting 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.390
 in the games a little bit 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.390

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.379
 I put the turkey the turkey is me 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.900
 my gang prepossession 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.669
 I say stopping now I see you we're going to 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.849
 watch 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.639
 but in January 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.889
 to have another point also more thrown 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.780
 uncle 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.780

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.129
 birth of this doll we alluded 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.289
 active god 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.809
 through a little merit force 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.399
 before the sleight of hand I will bring all 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:17.099
 those that I have bought that I have some 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:21.629
 how many and you say to see what you think in 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.639
 each one of them and good but I 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.749
 I recommend that you see how the games are 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.749
 that the truth that pretty cool 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.740

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.669

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.669
 have again 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.849
 Be careful how you fail most to the pp and 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.610

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:52.029
 in this and some who trace consultation 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.029
 too 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.270
 let's see 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.520
 from here when I get to what 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.520
 Straight Straight Loose Accelerators 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.530
 nothing nothing nothing 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.530

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 white 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.460
 also so they would be so bad 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:39.240
 the audio 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.240
