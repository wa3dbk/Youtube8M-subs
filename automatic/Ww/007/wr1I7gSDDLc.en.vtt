actually a complete seal of unit and you

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.410

just doing a cold soak with them before

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080 
just doing a cold soak with them before
you<00:02:35.320> press<00:02:35.560> them<00:02:35.800> but<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.310> basically<00:02:36.430> becomes

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
you press them but it basically becomes

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.090 
you press them but it basically becomes
an<00:02:37.300> extra<00:02:37.570> tank<00:02:37.750> around<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.140> winery<00:02:38.470> well

here we got the guts of a DME press
right<00:02:40.990> now<00:02:41.670> really<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.940> center<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.300> attention

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
right now really the center of attention

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.110 
right now really the center of attention
here<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.380> Becker<00:02:44.620> compressor<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
here is the Becker compressor it's the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.730 
here is the Becker compressor it's the
top-of-the-line<00:02:46.720> compressor<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> world

top-of-the-line compressor in the world

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.350 
top-of-the-line compressor in the world
right<00:02:47.920> now<00:02:48.070> you'll<00:02:48.280> find<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.820> all<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.150> very

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
right now you'll find it in all the very

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.440 
right now you'll find it in all the very
best<00:02:49.450> presses<00:02:50.700> we've<00:02:51.700> also<00:02:51.880> got<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.240> blower

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
best presses we've also got the blower

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.660 
best presses we've also got the blower
right<00:02:52.720> here<00:02:53.110> normally<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.980> blower<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.280> just

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
right here normally the blower is just

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.920 
right here normally the blower is just
used<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.560> evacuating<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.860> membrane<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:58.690> it's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
used for evacuating the membrane as it's

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.800 
used for evacuating the membrane as it's
going<00:02:59.170> into<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.440> vacuum<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:00.400> DME<00:03:01.060> because<00:03:01.660> it's

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
going into a vacuum but DME because it's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.290 
going into a vacuum but DME because it's
such<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.960> high-volume<00:03:02.560> machine<00:03:03.100> low<00:03:04.030> pressure

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
such a high-volume machine low pressure

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.510 
such a high-volume machine low pressure
but<00:03:04.510> high<00:03:04.660> volume<00:03:05.050> DME<00:03:05.320> has<00:03:05.560> also<00:03:05.890> decided<00:03:06.460> to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
but high volume DME has also decided to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.160 
but high volume DME has also decided to
incorporate<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.150> blower<00:03:07.360> into<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
incorporate the blower into the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.500 
incorporate the blower into the
inflating<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.070> bladder<00:03:09.310> for<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.910> first

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
stages to get the bulk of the air and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.160 
stages to get the bulk of the air and
and<00:03:12.880> then<00:03:13.030> turns<00:03:13.300> over<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> job<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.050> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and then turns over the job to the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.920 
and then turns over the job to the
Becker<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.920> do<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> final<00:03:15.600> pressurization<00:03:16.600> of

Becker to do the final pressurization of

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.810 
Becker to do the final pressurization of
the<00:03:17.050> membrane<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.950> way<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.340> saves<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.790> time

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
the membrane this way it saves you time

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.090 
the membrane this way it saves you time
during<00:03:19.420> your<00:03:19.510> press<00:03:19.810> cycles<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.620> also<00:03:20.770> takes

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
during your press cycles it also takes

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.620 
during your press cycles it also takes
the<00:03:21.190> load<00:03:21.460> off<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.850> compressor<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.390> only

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the load off the compressor and only

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.240 
the load off the compressor and only
makes<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> compressor<00:03:23.320> do<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.740> designed

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
makes the compressor do is it designed

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.340 
makes the compressor do is it designed
to<00:03:24.370> do<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:25.030> pressurize<00:03:25.990> the

to do and that is pressurize the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.680 
to do and that is pressurize the
membrane<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:27.550> also<00:03:27.880> see<00:03:28.060> we've<00:03:28.240> got<00:03:28.420> another

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
membrane you also see we've got another

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.750 
membrane you also see we've got another
compressor<00:03:29.230> on<00:03:29.350> board<00:03:29.560> right<00:03:29.740> here<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:30.490> only

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
compressor on board right here the only

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.220 
compressor on board right here the only
function<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.150> this<00:03:31.240> compressor<00:03:31.720> serves<00:03:31.990> is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
function of this compressor serves is

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.410 
function of this compressor serves is
just<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.620> run<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.980> door<00:03:33.190> pneumatics<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.240> this

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
just to run the door pneumatics so this

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.030 
just to run the door pneumatics so this
is<00:03:34.570> running<00:03:34.750> your<00:03:34.960> seal<00:03:35.290> on<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> door<00:03:35.650> and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
is running your seal on the door and

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.160 
is running your seal on the door and
it's<00:03:36.190> also<00:03:36.340> running<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:37.210> RAM<00:03:37.480> which<00:03:37.720> opening

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
it's also running the RAM which opening

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.900 
it's also running the RAM which opening
opens<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.680> closes<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.220> door<00:03:39.250> pneumatically

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
opens and closes the door pneumatically

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.390 
opens and closes the door pneumatically
so<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> completely<00:03:41.290> independent<00:03:41.560> system<00:03:42.190> from

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
so a completely independent system from

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.520 
so a completely independent system from
the<00:03:42.520> bladder<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.030> drum<00:03:43.240> itself<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.870> as
