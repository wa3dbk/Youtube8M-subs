all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.230> my<00:00:01.319> video<00:00:01.589> showing<00:00:02.040> the

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
all right this is my video showing the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.100 
all right this is my video showing the
test<00:00:02.610> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> upgraded<00:00:03.449> lighting<00:00:03.629> stator<00:00:04.020> I

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
test of the upgraded lighting stator I

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.980 
test of the upgraded lighting stator I
made<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.310> H<00:00:05.460> series<00:00:05.730> KTX<00:00:06.509> bikes

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
made for the a and H series KTX bikes

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.210 
made for the a and H series KTX bikes
both<00:00:07.290> 200-220

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
both 200-220

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.919 
both 200-220
this<00:00:08.700> particular<00:00:09.030> bike<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.889> 2002<00:00:10.889> 20<00:00:11.190> model

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
this particular bike is a 2002 20 model

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.270 
this particular bike is a 2002 20 model
so<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.110> seating<00:00:13.620> side<00:00:13.769> panel<00:00:14.160> been

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
so you can see seating side panel been

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.800 
so you can see seating side panel been
removed<00:00:15.800> got<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> standard<00:00:17.430> ac/dc<00:00:18.150> multimeter

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
removed got a standard ac/dc multimeter

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.580 
removed got a standard ac/dc multimeter
set<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.220> show<00:00:20.400> AC<00:00:20.699> current<00:00:21.330> right<00:00:21.510> now<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
set up to show AC current right now and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679 
set up to show AC current right now and
that's<00:00:22.680> wired<00:00:22.949> directly<00:00:23.490> into<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.390> yellow

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that's wired directly into the yellow

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's wired directly into the yellow
stator<00:00:24.960> wire<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.279> raw<00:00:26.430> output

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
stator wire which is just the raw output

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.529 
stator wire which is just the raw output
directly<00:00:27.269> from<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> lighting<00:00:27.869> stator<00:00:29.539> around

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
directly from the lighting stator around

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
directly from the lighting stator around
on<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> front<00:00:31.489> got<00:00:32.489> another<00:00:32.669> ac/dc

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
on the front got another ac/dc

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.209 
on the front got another ac/dc
multimeter<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.290> time<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> set<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:34.980> show

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
multimeter this time it set up to show

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
multimeter this time it set up to show
AC<00:00:35.550> volts<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> wired<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:39.469> 255

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
AC volts and that is wired in to 255

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.940 
AC volts and that is wired in to 255

watt h7 car headlight bulbs those are
wired<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.250> series<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.660> voltage<00:00:45.930> reading

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
wired in series and the voltage reading

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
wired in series and the voltage reading
will<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.320> taken<00:00:46.680> directly<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.160> them<00:00:47.460> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
will be taken directly from them in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.529 
will be taken directly from them in
addition<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> 255<00:00:49.860> watt<00:00:50.100> bulbs<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:51.270> stock

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
addition to the 255 watt bulbs the stock

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
10 watt tail light bulb is in place so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.130 
10 watt tail light bulb is in place so
that<00:00:54.030> should<00:00:54.180> give<00:00:54.300> us<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.480> total<00:00:54.660> draw<00:00:54.989> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that should give us a total draw of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.740 
that should give us a total draw of
about<00:00:55.379> 120<00:00:55.949> watts

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
about 120 watts

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.000 
about 120 watts
that's<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:57.899> -10<00:00:58.469> degrees<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:59.039> now<00:01:01.010> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that's about -10 degrees right now the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
that's about -10 degrees right now the
bike<00:01:02.219> has<00:01:02.460> been<00:01:02.489> started<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.420> warmed<00:01:03.629> up

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
bike has been started and warmed up

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.039 
bike has been started and warmed up
prior<00:01:04.729> all<00:01:05.729> tests<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.299> done<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.600> idle<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
prior all tests will be done at idle and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:19.740 
prior all tests will be done at idle and
slightly<00:01:07.229> above

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:28.080 

the<00:01:20.680> headlights<00:01:20.980> on

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:40.960 

about<00:01:28.990> five<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.500> half<00:01:29.580> survival

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.170 

and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.180> tidal<00:01:43.220> drag<00:01:44.220> about<00:01:44.550> twelve<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and then tidal drag about twelve and a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.540 
and then tidal drag about twelve and a
half<00:01:45.210> volts<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.020> with<00:01:49.320> both<00:01:49.560> headlight

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
half volts that is with both headlight

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:04.819 
half volts that is with both headlight
bulbs<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.650> tail<00:01:52.830> light<00:01:53.040> functioning

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.219 

so<00:02:05.829> there<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.039> have<00:02:06.069> it
