versus<00:00:08.970> Anya<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:09.780> actually<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:10.080> doing

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
versus Anya so we can actually be doing

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.600 
versus Anya so we can actually be doing
something<00:00:10.469> different<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.130> change<00:00:11.160> I've

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
something different for a change I've

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.209 
something different for a change I've
never<00:00:11.910> actually<00:00:12.150> done<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.450> before<00:00:13.009> but<00:00:14.009> I

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
never actually done this before but I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.129 
never actually done this before but I
think<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.089> something<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.540> would<00:00:15.690> love<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
think it's something that would love to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.910 
think it's something that would love to
do<00:00:16.260> as<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.279> know<00:00:17.960> we<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.560> against

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.290 
world and we're going to play the game
pretty<00:01:02.640> much<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
pretty much like we would in a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.369 
pretty much like we would in a
pre-release<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.870> obviously<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.350> not

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
pre-release but obviously it's not

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
pre-release but obviously it's not
pre-release<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> way<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.880> older

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pre-release this is way way older

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.719 
pre-release this is way way older
dragons<00:01:07.200> exalted<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.740> instance<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.490> we

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
dragons exalted for instance but we

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
dragons exalted for instance but we
thought<00:01:09.150> we'd<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.200> quite

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
thought we'd do that because it's quite

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.380 
thought we'd do that because it's quite
we're<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.740> done<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.040> before<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:12.330> not

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
we're not done that before and we're not

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
we're not done that before and we're not
very<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.409> construct<00:01:14.250> decks<00:01:14.580> actively

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
very we don't construct decks actively

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
very we don't construct decks actively
and<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> time<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and we just don't have the time to do

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
and we just don't have the time to do
that<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.700> probably<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that and we don't probably have the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.149 
that and we don't probably have the
expertise<00:01:18.960> either<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.930> we<00:01:21.930> decided<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
expertise either so we decided to you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
expertise either so we decided to you
know<00:01:23.189> throw<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.759> sealed<00:01:24.270> event<00:01:24.600> for

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
know throw a little sealed event for

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 
know throw a little sealed event for
ourselves<00:01:25.340> because<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> best<00:01:26.759> way<00:01:26.939> we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
ourselves because that's the best way we

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
ourselves because that's the best way we
can<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.479> play<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> game<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:29.040> much

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
