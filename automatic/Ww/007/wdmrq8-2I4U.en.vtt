00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
transmission in this car I don't feel

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.990 
transmission in this car I don't feel
it's<00:02:05.560> got<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.890> mushy<00:02:06.189> feeling<00:02:06.549> where<00:02:06.880> you're

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000

it's got that mushy feeling where you're
searching<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.420> gears<00:02:07.869> in<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> corner<00:02:08.530> it

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
searching for gears in the corner it

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.010 
searching for gears in the corner it
just<00:02:09.130> seems<00:02:09.310> like<00:02:09.520> really<00:02:10.420> quickly<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.899> can

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
just seems like really quickly you can

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.009 
just seems like really quickly you can
grab<00:02:11.290> any<00:02:11.500> gear<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.920> want<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:16.690> don't<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.989> a

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
grab any gear you want you don't have a

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.570 
grab any gear you want you don't have a
lot<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.260> torque<00:02:17.620> steer<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> front<00:02:18.370> wheels

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.220 
lot of torque steer in the front wheels
either<00:02:18.880> which<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.330> great<00:02:19.599> for<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.840> front-wheel

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
either which is great for a front-wheel

either which is great for a front-wheel
drive<00:02:20.440> car<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:22.410> think<00:02:23.410> they've<00:02:23.530> achieved<00:02:23.680> just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
drive car I think they've achieved just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.070 
drive car I think they've achieved just
the<00:02:24.519> right<00:02:24.670> balance

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.390 

I<00:02:31.850> just<00:02:32.850> drove<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.210> mazdaspeed3<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:35.130> car

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
I just drove the mazdaspeed3 this car

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.580 
I just drove the mazdaspeed3 this car
had<00:02:35.640> great<00:02:35.940> mazda<00:02:36.630> performance<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.440> you'd

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
had great mazda performance what you'd

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.940 
had great mazda performance what you'd
expect<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.200> treat<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.740> with<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
expect you do have to treat it with a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.410 
expect you do have to treat it with a
bit<00:02:41.190> more<00:02:41.370> finesse<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.390> through

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
bit more finesse just to get it through

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.540 
bit more finesse just to get it through
the<00:02:42.630> corners<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.800> car<00:02:44.040> does<00:02:44.220> tend<00:02:44.460> to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the corners the car does tend to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.580 
the corners the car does tend to
understeer<00:02:45.030> quite<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.330> bit<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.140> once<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.470> get

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
understeer quite a bit but once you get

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.410 
understeer quite a bit but once you get
used<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.340> start<00:02:47.640> feeding<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.210> power

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
used to that and start feeding the power

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.750 
used to that and start feeding the power
and<00:02:48.750> slower<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:50.010> helps<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.370> get<00:02:50.520> around

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
and slower it just helps you get around

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.180 
and slower it just helps you get around
the<00:02:50.910> circuit<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.330> bit<00:02:51.480> faster<00:02:51.900> otherwise<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the circuit a bit faster otherwise the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.100 
the circuit a bit faster otherwise the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
right off the end of the corner it

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.870 
right off the end of the corner it
really<00:02:57.750> held<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.470> road<00:02:58.650> well<00:02:58.890> there<00:02:59.520> was<00:02:59.730> an

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
really held the road well there was an

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.420 
really held the road well there was an
obsessive<00:03:00.450> wall<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.960> found<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> high-speed

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
obsessive wall I found in the high-speed

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.490 
obsessive wall I found in the high-speed
corners<00:03:02.910> where<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.270> hit<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> bumps<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.350> would

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
corners where you hit the bumps it would

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.620 
corners where you hit the bumps it would
just<00:03:04.680> take<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.250> bump<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.670> settle<00:03:06.000> nicely<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
just take the bump and settle nicely I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.990 
just take the bump and settle nicely I
gave<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.709> thumbs<00:03:07.950> up<00:03:08.190> I'd<00:03:08.430> love<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> drive

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
gave it a thumbs up I'd love to drive

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.670 
gave it a thumbs up I'd love to drive
this<00:03:09.180> thing<00:03:09.390> more<00:03:09.630> now<00:03:10.260> we're<00:03:10.410> going<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.590> go

this thing more now we're going to go

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:27.890 
this thing more now we're going to go

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
feel than the mazdaspeed3 it has a lot

all-wheel-drive just with the flick of a
button<00:03:42.099> it's<00:03:42.640> amazing<00:03:42.970> how<00:03:43.209> fast<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.780> shifts

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.130 

typical<00:03:53.590> VW<00:03:54.130> style<00:03:54.490> I<00:03:57.270> almost<00:03:58.270> feel<00:03:58.570> like<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.840> am

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
typical VW style I almost feel like I am

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.750 
typical VW style I almost feel like I am
in<00:03:59.170> more<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.950> Turing<00:04:00.700> car<00:04:04.920> wow<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.550> was

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
in more of a Turing car wow that was

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.760 
in more of a Turing car wow that was
great<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.390> have<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.840> say<00:04:08.020> it's<00:04:08.140> got<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.410> bit<00:04:08.620> more

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
great I have to say it's got a bit more

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.220 
great I have to say it's got a bit more
of<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.010> GT<00:04:09.550> than<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:09.970> track<00:04:10.300> cart<00:04:10.570> feel<00:04:10.810> about<00:04:11.050> it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
of a GT than a track cart feel about it

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.040 
of a GT than a track cart feel about it
the<00:04:12.160> all-wheel<00:04:12.490> drive<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.210> incredible<00:04:13.870> I

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
the all-wheel drive is incredible I

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.500 
the all-wheel drive is incredible I
actually<00:04:14.590> prefer<00:04:15.070> that<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.700> sports<00:04:15.970> compact

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
actually prefer that in a sports compact

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.840 
actually prefer that in a sports compact
but<00:04:17.080> really<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.620> down<00:04:17.860> on<00:04:18.040> power<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.549> I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
but really it is down on power and I

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.160 
but really it is down on power and I
think<00:04:19.090> they<00:04:19.209> could<00:04:19.420> use<00:04:19.570> another<00:04:19.690> 50

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
think they could use another 50

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.260 
think they could use another 50
horsepower<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:21.190> might<00:04:21.370> not<00:04:21.489> be<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.790> fastest

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270
