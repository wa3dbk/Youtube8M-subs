00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello how about how things are going today we 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.370
 talk about 5 tips to do 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.370
 photographs in summer 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.830
 vacation if you're not already and we've 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.540
 thought about giving you some tips for 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
 Take pictures during those days 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.830
 although these tips can also be 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 apply for any trip first 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 everything is to prepare the material before 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.489
 of the trip is surely the most obvious 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.470
 but to whom it has not happened that once 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.390
 arrived at the destination we realize 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.330
 that we have left the card 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.400
 battery or the classic of the classics the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.739
 charger plugged in happily at home 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.720
 We have several models of backpacks for 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 move material if you're going to take 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.560
 a camera with a zoom lens you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.450
 We recommend a cover designed for 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.120
 bring the camera with the lens mounted 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.880
 instead if you plan to bring more material 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 with you we recommend a backpack 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.630
 there are also covers for cameras 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.940
 compact 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.950
 to avoid this kind of thing is going well 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.140
 prepare the material one or two days 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.150
 before we also recommend you make a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.220
 inventory of what you take for 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.770
 prevent oversights in the place you are 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.380
 the second advice is to empty the card 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.150
 at home another classic is to be in the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 place of vacation take our 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.290
 camera to make the first photo and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.320
 find us with the card full no 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.120
 nothing happens the formatting is already done and if the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.370
 photos on the card still do not 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.080
 you had downloaded them to your computer or 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.210
 you can not erase them for some reason 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.130
 keeping in mind that you will be out 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.200
 several days and you will not be able to download 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.720
 images we recommend you take 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.240
 a card with a lot of capacity or more 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.490
 one and that you shoot in jpg you'll win 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.590
 space if you are one of those who remains without 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.020
 make the photo by pérez to take the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.640
 camera case do not hesitate leave the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.979
 backpack in the place where you stay 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.320
 and for a good strap there are cameras that 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.360
 already come on a leash but for trips the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.369
 more advisable is a black rapid its 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.890
 Adapter is more reliable and you'll save yourself 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.780
 scares when you're on the road always goes 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.920
 well take us a tripod to make us 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.180
 group photos 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.040
 self-portraits photos 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.619
 of long exposure there are 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.690
 different types we leave the link to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 blog about tripod types and how 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.280
 choose it if your luggage allows it 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.130
 You can take one carbon or a monkey 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.870
 piece if you can not opt ​​for a mini if 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.030
 you have a compact camera there is no 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.709
 problem but if you use one of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.380
 interchangeable lens you have two 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.690
 options take you a fixed goal or a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.150
 zoom lens the most practical thing is a zoom 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.470
 so you'll have several focal lengths and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.200
 you will not have to be changing 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.190
 objective that will have less opening 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600
 of the diaphragm 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.300
 if you want to put yourself to the test you can 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.030
 choose between two or three fixed lenses or 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.790
 if you only hurry me one like this 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.770
 more limitations you will extract more ingenuity 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.480
 to take your pictures if you go to 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.880
 take pictures at peak times like the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.200
 noon closes the diaphragm and the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.750
 speed so they do not go out 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.459
 overexposed the light rush hour is 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.890
 the best for taking pictures underwater 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.140
 Remember to use the lens hood or filters 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.270
 polarizer is it will be difficult to see the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.430
 screen you can use the viewer and 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.050
 guide you through the histogram prevents the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.330
 Beach sand does not read 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.920
 the gears and if you fall into the water 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.930
 let it dry before returning it to 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.150
 turn on just like good weather 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.010
 You can drop a summer storm well 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.020
 that we recommend that you take a case 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.700
 protective for the camera and up to here 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.260
