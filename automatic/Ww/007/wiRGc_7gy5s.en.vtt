00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.530 
do say so myself it looks like kind of
the<00:01:58.140> exact<00:01:58.470> same<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.090> Fast<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the exact same as the one in Fast and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.389 
the exact same as the one in Fast and
Furious<00:02:00.630> 7<00:02:00.900> that's<00:02:01.619> pretty<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
Furious 7 that's pretty much it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
Furious 7 that's pretty much it
the<00:02:02.640> handling<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.330> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:03.780> dodgy<00:02:03.960> but

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the handling it's a little bit dodgy but

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.230 
the handling it's a little bit dodgy but
hopefully<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.850> changed<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
hopefully if you just changed the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.600 
hopefully if you just changed the
hunting<00:02:06.600> codes<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.409> could<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:08.220> improved

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
hunting codes then it could be improved

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
hunting codes then it could be improved
yeah<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.810> yeah<00:02:10.259> that's<00:02:10.470> pretty<00:02:10.500> much<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.890> speed

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
yeah and yeah that's pretty much a speed

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.370 
yeah and yeah that's pretty much a speed
