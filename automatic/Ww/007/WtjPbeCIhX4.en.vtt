00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.910
 hello, youtube guys have one more 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.700
 time in the June area for everyone 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.460
 It's how I Met I showed my 90 1 and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.240
 now I'm going to show 1902 the difference 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.840
 person only is the inner color is not golden 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.650
 the trance miss is a very business 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.539
 nice, right 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.039
 I already did one of these right here leaving a 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.850
 little aside 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.910
 I'll make a video of you from here the clock 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.579
 It's practically the same, but I think. 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.739
 in my internal point of view of this blue 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.860
 it's a little more beautiful 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.770
 there is the old contrast with golden 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.440
 I like much of the contrast 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.160
 bottoms create these people when they 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.000
 so in the stopwatch you have to 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.899
 search for the drawing fetch the buttons 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.160
 I'm going to drive miles for him and 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.640
 about one minute 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.119
 and there it will be filled with three 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.369
 working straight is this area has 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.729
 Empty personal watch is very beautiful 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.060
 to see the romario is today much sought after 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.869
 this hollow area on the watch without 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.869
 get out all ravaged 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.779
 all married and nanÃ¡ round box has 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.779
 these star lines that are the 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:39.499
 details let the camera catch us 

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:41.899
 little focus on neighboring districts 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:46.279
 he has a mistake here a symbol of 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.989
 speech is not one in s 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:52.429
 in fact, the i is superimposed on the 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:56.349
 it seems to be a r 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:59.529
 but it's an undefeated tour 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:04.380
 waiting for the focus a little 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:06.750
 ready he's a trustee speech 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.679
 this watch is very handsome very person 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 Beautiful it is the contents of a boot 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:19.830
 One minute, then I'll say hello. 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.340
 people realize this point here he is a 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.870
 minute and hour timer it will give 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.590
 the return of 12 hours so far to the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.300
 poverty will be a timer works until 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 the person as a test of how 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.470
 Are you going to buy a watch? 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.500
 let him todinho hopes to give a grandfather of 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.130
 one minute on the timer to be able to do 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.299
 the test really tip reset 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.250
 although there are people who do not use 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:52.160
 These chronograph stopwatch functions 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:57.630
 nervous animals do not use animals and they 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.630
 In victory we know that you are an expert in 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.840
 watches and works really works 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.470
 as a clock works the same way 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.350
 that you see details on the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.910
 Crown also realized this, right? 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.650
 in a very beautiful speech very very 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.989
 well finished 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.989
 in 2010 he has opinion 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:34.480
 and I did not take the girls to number 901 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:37.000
 but there who saw 901 mid-level 90 2 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.190
 and will measure the house of this love of 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.480
 person avoids in virtues that 5.2 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.540
 centimeters 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.950
 really the information hits is who 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.160
 my children know that they have the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:53.620
 Unconquered logic does not waver in girls and 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.230
 I measure here and see that it is different from 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.220
 of my measurement is the height of the box 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.530
 personnel of this watch or another person 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.930
 box gave 21 centimeters 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:13.000
 is a high-nonsense arm is very 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.950
 very high arm too high after 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.459
 select them too 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:23.370
 she initially started with 3.2 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.110
 centimeters 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.880
 the two have a shape that three brothers 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.900
 Bracelet's initial engineers and she 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.790
 ends with 2.6 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.260
 Of course there is no difference, yes but 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.320
 today you centimeters 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.160
 is this the watch is very good is the weight 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.870
 this is logical that it is little 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.320
 though again and I'll try to show 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.320
 you 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.319
 is on fire 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:12.680
 of the 364 grams the very good ready watch 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.160
 very good person 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.670
 It's perfect on the arm, I think. 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.850
 that gives you a lot of cursing who likes 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.520
 in undefeated is a silliness of a person 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.590
 A hug for everyone voting more 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.140
 once in the area in my contacts to 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.570
 that come into contact that the site has a thousand 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.560
 hahaha, they were with a hug to everyone 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.560
 You guys stay with God.
