00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
the weather that it was not draining

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.160 
the weather that it was not draining
like<00:00:18.100> constantly<00:00:18.940> it<00:00:19.210> was<00:00:19.420> always<00:00:19.600> raining<00:00:19.990> a

like constantly it was always raining a

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.320 
like constantly it was always raining a
bit<00:00:20.320> and<00:00:20.619> then<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:20.949> Sun<00:00:21.160> came<00:00:21.189> out<00:00:21.460> again<00:00:21.760> this

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
bit and then the Sun came out again this

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.900 
bit and then the Sun came out again this
made<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.570> quite<00:00:23.199> stable<00:00:23.529> surface<00:00:24.369> which<00:00:24.760> was

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
made a quite stable surface which was

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.490 
made a quite stable surface which was
good<00:00:25.090> to<00:00:25.269> compare<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:25.900> different<00:00:26.230> kind<00:00:26.410> of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
good to compare the different kind of

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.519 
good to compare the different kind of
things<00:00:26.679> we<00:00:26.859> were<00:00:26.949> testing<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.990> also<00:00:28.990> I'm<00:00:29.230> very

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
things we were testing and also I'm very

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.040 
things we were testing and also I'm very
happy<00:00:29.859> that<00:00:29.890> Romo<00:00:30.789> could<00:00:30.970> join<00:00:31.210> our<00:00:31.420> tests<00:00:31.869> or

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
happy that Romo could join our tests or

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.080 
happy that Romo could join our tests or
he<00:00:32.349> was<00:00:32.500> trying<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.980> explain<00:00:33.070> me<00:00:33.490> a<00:00:33.520> bit<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.790> the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
he was trying to explain me a bit of the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.330 
he was trying to explain me a bit of the
lines<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.720> bit<00:00:34.870> though<00:00:35.020> how<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.680> carry<00:00:36.100> more

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
lines of a bit though how to carry more

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.670 
lines of a bit though how to carry more
speed<00:00:36.550> in<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.120> corners<00:00:37.629> and<00:00:37.840> I<00:00:38.170> think<00:00:38.410> this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
speed in the corners and I think this

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.650 
speed in the corners and I think this
was<00:00:38.920> very<00:00:39.340> very<00:00:39.579> useful<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.149> I<00:00:40.360> should<00:00:40.540> have

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
was very very useful and I should have

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.029 
was very very useful and I should have
done<00:00:40.840> some<00:00:41.020> work<00:00:41.110> this<00:00:41.289> much<00:00:41.559> earlier<00:00:41.920> before

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
done some work this much earlier before

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.670 
done some work this much earlier before
and<00:00:42.460> no<00:00:43.360> I<00:00:43.390> hope<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:44.170> test<00:00:44.469> will

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
and no I hope that the test will

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.910 
and no I hope that the test will
continue<00:00:45.219> in<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.940> positive<00:00:46.120> way<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.770> we

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
continue in a positive way and that we

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.150 
continue in a positive way and that we
can<00:00:48.100> finish<00:00:48.309> everything<00:00:48.910> in<00:00:49.329> time<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
can finish everything in time and that

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.010 
can finish everything in time and that
we<00:00:51.309> can<00:00:51.489> take<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:52.059> good<00:00:52.180> result<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:52.809> next

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
we can take the good result in the next

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:33.920 
we can take the good result in the next
release

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.719 

we<00:01:34.930> are<00:01:35.049> six<00:01:35.290> points<00:01:35.799> behind<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
we are six points behind in the

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.530 
we are six points behind in the
championship<00:01:37.270> right<00:01:37.479> now<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.490> normally<00:01:39.540> we

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
championship right now and normally we

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.139 
championship right now and normally we
should<00:01:40.750> try<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.500> win<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.399> but<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:42.970> will

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
should try to win that and but it will

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.940 
should try to win that and but it will
be<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.299> hard<00:01:43.509> task<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.960> mean<00:01:44.140> broke<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.799> not

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
be a hard task I mean broke up is not

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.149 
be a hard task I mean broke up is not
too<00:01:45.520> slow<00:01:45.759> anyway<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.509> his<00:01:46.780> SS<00:01:47.380> at<00:01:47.530> six<00:01:47.740> points

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
too slow anyway and his SS at six points

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.789 
too slow anyway and his SS at six points
in<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.369> lead<00:01:48.520> so<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.930> course<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.320> have<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.500> try

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
in the lead so of course you have to try

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
in the lead so of course you have to try
but<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.820> won't<00:01:52.000> go<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.539> mad<00:01:54.000> anyway

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
but we won't go like mad anyway

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.090 
but we won't go like mad anyway
necessarily<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:56.289> think<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.590> always<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.979> to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
necessarily I think you always have to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.630 
necessarily I think you always have to
find<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.119> good<00:01:58.920> aureus<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.039> average<00:02:00.429> between

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
find a good aureus a average between

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:22.830 
find a good aureus a average between
going<00:02:01.119> med<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.539> trying<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.380> save<00:02:02.560> your<00:02:02.679> life

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.630

no as I start to understand the road a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.970 
no as I start to understand the road a
bit<00:02:25.790> better<00:02:26.120> i<00:02:26.239> also<00:02:26.989> started<00:02:27.469> to<00:02:27.590> like<00:02:27.799> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
bit better i also started to like the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:03:36.149 
bit better i also started to like the
roads<00:02:28.159> better<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.819> it's<00:02:29.120> quite<00:02:29.390> nice<00:02:29.599> ya<00:02:30.049> know

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.490 

good<00:03:37.159> question<00:03:37.640> at<00:03:38.450> least<00:03:38.689> we<00:03:38.930> will<00:03:39.049> do<00:03:39.200> one

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
good question at least we will do one

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.699 
good question at least we will do one
drowned<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.569> sea<00:03:41.569> for<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:42.049> year<00:03:42.290> as<00:03:42.500> we

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
drowned in a sea for this year as we

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.199 
drowned in a sea for this year as we
were<00:03:43.159> second<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.760> junior<00:03:44.030> ship

were second and a junior ship
championship<00:03:45.110> last<00:03:45.290> year<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.010> we<00:03:46.189> gain<00:03:46.400> one

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659
