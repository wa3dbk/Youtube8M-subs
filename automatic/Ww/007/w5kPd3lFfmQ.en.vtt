00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.990
 at 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.660
 1 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.770
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.600
 you are fine 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.650
 today are found on gta 5 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.900
 online for a new video 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.320
 information about the pc version 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.090
 Game 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 why rockstar took so long 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.750
 to release the pc version is that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.180
 it was in the intentions of rockstar 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.770
 to release it so late so rockstar has 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.809
 answered these two questions during a 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.250
 interview given to pc gamer magazine 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.590
 so I immediately give you some 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.750
 answers we always had for 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.000
 plan to go out i was 5 on pc 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.320
 the pc version was planned since the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.300
 beginning and we made some decisions 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.520
 techniques related to the fact that we 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.050
 would make a pc version of the game and 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.300
 even though we started to develop 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.710
 the pc version very early we chose 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.500
 to focus the bulk of our 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.780
 watch out for the ps3 and xbox versions 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.579
 360 at first in order to 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.120
 push these farthest 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.739
 possible 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.800
 we then focused our attention 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.180
 on the ps4 and xbox one versions and 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.610
 finally we used the architectured 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.229
 shared of these for us 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 help accelerate the development of the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.190
 pc version is thrust the game the most 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.750
 far possible knowing that this we 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.760
 would give the opportunity to make the game 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 more beautiful and more pleasant than ever 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.770
 so we'll say he wants them to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.570
 created gta 5 pc finally i have all the gta 5 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.850
 with small scales like that all 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.409
 first ps3 and xbox 360 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.409
 then they attacked the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.240
 ps4 and xbox one version and using 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.799
 the ps4 and xbox one version 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 they pushed him as far as possible 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.270
 to create the pc version so we will say 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.890
 that it was beneficial to rockstar in 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.869
 the sense that it made their work easier 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.340
 and for pc players I think they 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.140
 seen the result 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 they are they are not unhappy to have 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.400
 waited a little longer 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.990
 then here as the precise kevin war 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.240
 the president of rockstar toronto 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.460
 so we knew we will end up 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.990
 to release a pc version so the beginning of the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.119
 development of the latter has been 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.009
 made in parallel to that of the versions 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.450
 consoles by the way some of the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.970
 first preparation we have 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.700
 does for the pc like the 64 bit and the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.829
 dx11 accounting have served us well 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.709
 when we launched the ps4 and the 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:14.000
 xbox one the initial work made it easy 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.010
 the transition to the news 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.930
 consoles and allowed us to be thoroughly 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.730
 from the beginning the artists have us 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.950
 also prepared for the pc by creating 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.989
 work at resolutions ready for 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.489
 the pc and this even though we had to 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.040
 use massive versions 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.909
 scaled down 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.049
 on ps3 and xbox 360 and so here we have 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.700
 our answers I really hope that it 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.049
 you will have liked do not hesitate to let go 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.310
