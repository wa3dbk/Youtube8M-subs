and I heard about this course I saw it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.990 
and I heard about this course I saw it
on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.640> Internet<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:19.230> interested<00:00:19.830> in

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
on the Internet I was interested in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.580 
on the Internet I was interested in
having<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.210> new<00:00:21.810> career<00:00:21.960> working<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.350> animals

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and so I was very impressed with the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.050 
and so I was very impressed with the
idea<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.099> course<00:00:26.400> took<00:00:26.699> place<00:00:26.910> outside

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
idea that this course took place outside

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.300 
idea that this course took place outside
instead<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.109> buildings<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.980> community

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
instead of in buildings and community

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.859 
instead of in buildings and community
centers<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.789> most<00:00:30.029> dog<00:00:30.240> training<00:00:30.570> courses

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
struggling with the really basic

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100 
struggling with the really basic
obedience<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.739> could<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.460> their<00:01:06.110> lifetime

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
friendship with their dog ever so much

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
friendship with their dog ever so much
richer<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.409> knew<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.619> few<00:01:10.890> good

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
richer if they just knew a few good

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.469 
richer if they just knew a few good
obedience<00:01:11.820> commands<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.330> could

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
obedience commands that they could

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
obedience commands that they could
follow<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> market<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
follow so the market for this kind of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
follow so the market for this kind of
thing<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.610> huge<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.540> much<00:01:15.720> huger<00:01:16.020> than<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.229> ever

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
thing is huge as much huger than I ever

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.830 
thing is huge as much huger than I ever
imagined<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:17.549> getting<00:01:18.150> exactly<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
imagined I'm getting exactly what I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
imagined I'm getting exactly what I
expected<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.560> dog<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.830> good<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.729> those<00:01:20.790> places

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
expected my dog is good in those places

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.690 
expected my dog is good in those places
and<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.619> learning<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.460> tricks

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and we're just learning some tricks

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.679 
and we're just learning some tricks
which<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> another<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.450> really

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
which is another thing that really

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.090 
which is another thing that really
appealed<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> me<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.500> learning<00:01:25.860> tricks

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
appealed to me was learning tricks

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
appealed to me was learning tricks
instead<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.880> formal<00:01:27.180> obedience

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
instead of the more formal obedience

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.160 
instead of the more formal obedience
that<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:29.159> lot<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> dog<00:01:30.210> trainers<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.810> involved

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that a lot of dog trainers get involved

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.960 
that a lot of dog trainers get involved
in<00:01:31.490> because<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:33.329> creative<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> I

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
in because it's more creative and I

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.069 
in because it's more creative and I
think<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.119> fun<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> dog<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think it's more fun for the dog and it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
think it's more fun for the dog and it
allows<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> lot<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> imagination<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
allows a lot of imagination for the the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.830 
allows a lot of imagination for the the
owner

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840

actually getting to know the animal

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.960 
actually getting to know the animal
before<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.200> even<00:02:50.230> start<00:02:50.620> attempting<00:02:51.160> the

before you can even start attempting the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.009 
before you can even start attempting the
training<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:54.430> really<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.910> know<00:02:55.060> how

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
training you really have to know how

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:12.640 
training you really have to know how
they<00:02:56.170> makes<00:02:56.620> him<00:02:56.739> tick<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.790> big<00:03:01.030> old

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.200 
I've learned a lot from been in the way
of<00:03:15.650> how<00:03:16.650> important<00:03:17.340> body<00:03:17.490> language<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.060> to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
dogs and how much they respond just with

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.960 
dogs and how much they respond just with
little<00:03:22.130> small<00:03:23.130> pieces<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.580> body<00:03:23.850> language

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
little small pieces of body language

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.300 
little small pieces of body language
really<00:03:24.720> helps<00:03:24.990> rather<00:03:25.590> than<00:03:25.740> correcting<00:03:26.190> all
