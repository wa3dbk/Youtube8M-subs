00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
considering that 2,000 subscribers is a

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.869 
considering that 2,000 subscribers is a
pretty<00:02:51.290> big<00:02:51.470> deal<00:02:51.680> maybe<00:02:52.069> not<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.400> some<00:02:52.579> people

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.000 
but to me it seems like a pretty pretty
big<00:02:55.670> accomplishment<00:02:55.900> because<00:02:56.900> 1,000<00:02:57.889> it's

I<00:03:35.299> have<00:03:35.510> been<00:03:35.540> getting<00:03:35.690> several<00:03:36.199> requests<00:03:36.919> for

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
I have been getting several requests for

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.330 
I have been getting several requests for
a<00:03:37.549> face<00:03:37.819> cam<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.359> face<00:03:38.620> related<00:03:39.620> videos<00:03:40.010> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
a face cam and face related videos and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.580 
a face cam and face related videos and
so<00:03:40.849> I<00:03:40.879> figured<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.989> would<00:03:42.139> be<00:03:42.199> a<00:03:42.290> prime

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
so I figured that this would be a prime

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.490 
so I figured that this would be a prime
opportunity<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.790> start<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.660> I'm

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
opportunity to start that and I'm

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.349 
opportunity to start that and I'm
actually<00:03:45.650> really<00:03:46.340> interested<00:03:46.879> if<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.120> were<00:03:47.239> to

actually really interested if I were to

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.449 
actually really interested if I were to
do<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.510> face<00:03:47.750> reveal<00:03:48.079> because<00:03:48.889> that'll<00:03:49.310> leave

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459
