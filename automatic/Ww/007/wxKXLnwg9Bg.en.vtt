less<00:01:01.250> more<00:01:01.910> or<00:01:01.970> less<00:01:02.180> what's<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.540> ball<00:01:02.660> that

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
less more or less what's the ball that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.869 
less more or less what's the ball that
the<00:01:03.050> stroke<00:01:03.290> for<00:01:03.470> me<00:01:03.559> I<00:01:03.739> went<00:01:04.640> through<00:01:04.820> a

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
the stroke for me I went through a

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.399 
the stroke for me I went through a
couple<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.269> other<00:01:05.390> ones<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:05.689> really<00:01:06.110> couldn't

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
couple of other ones but really couldn't

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.950 
couple of other ones but really couldn't
get<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.009> right<00:01:07.159> read<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.670> most<00:01:08.270> likely<00:01:08.509> was

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
get the right read and most likely was

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.690 
get the right read and most likely was
because<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.469> didn't<00:01:10.070> really<00:01:10.219> throw<00:01:10.490> them<00:01:10.610> as

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
because it didn't really throw them as

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.069 
because it didn't really throw them as
good<00:01:10.909> as<00:01:11.149> I<00:01:11.360> did<00:01:11.390> with<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.719> Marvel<00:01:11.960> that's

in<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.180> world<00:01:53.330> I<00:01:53.630> mean<00:01:54.049> who<00:01:54.860> doesn't<00:01:55.400> want<00:01:55.580> to

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
in the world I mean who doesn't want to

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.550 
in the world I mean who doesn't want to
do<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.210> mean<00:01:56.479> that's<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.780> dream<00:01:57.020> right

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
do that I mean that's a dream right

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.880 
do that I mean that's a dream right
there<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:58.119> think<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.240> was<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.659> little<00:01:59.960> bit<00:02:00.200> from

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
there I think it was a little bit from

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.050 
there I think it was a little bit from
what<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.130> saw<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.400> think<00:02:01.640> there<00:02:01.729> was<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.850> little

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
what I saw I think there was a little

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.060 
what I saw I think there was a little
first<00:02:02.270> tournament<00:02:02.600> jitters<00:02:03.020> because<00:02:03.950> there

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
first tournament jitters because there

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.800 
first tournament jitters because there
was<00:02:04.159> some<00:02:04.280> guys<00:02:04.460> there<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.330> last<00:02:05.570> game

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
was some guys there the last game

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.899 
was some guys there the last game
struggled<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.130> expected<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.759> bowl<00:02:07.880> a

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
struggled that I expected the bowl a

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.350 
struggled that I expected the bowl a
little<00:02:08.299> better

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
little better

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
little better
because<00:02:09.570> they're<00:02:10.020> great<00:02:10.259> bowlers<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.039> no

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
because they're great bowlers but no

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
because they're great bowlers but no
it's<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.460> first<00:02:11.610> tournament<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.210> swing

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and a lot of games left and I do think

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.590

I mean you know as I said I told del
last<00:03:06.330> night<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.570> said<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.350> don't<00:03:07.980> want<00:03:08.250> to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
last night I said I just don't want to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.520 
last night I said I just don't want to
get<00:03:08.489> off<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> bad<00:03:09.060> start<00:03:09.230> because<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.350> knew

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
get off to a bad start because I knew

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.900 
get off to a bad start because I knew
this<00:03:10.709> scoring<00:03:10.980> pace<00:03:11.220> was<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.730> so

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
this scoring pace was going to be so

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.570 
this scoring pace was going to be so
high<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.450> cheetah<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:14.220> know<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.430> you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
high for the cheetah and you know if you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.110 
high for the cheetah and you know if you
only<00:03:14.730> shoot<00:03:15.000> 150<00:03:15.750> 180<00:03:16.230> over<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.549> really<00:03:17.940> got<00:03:18.090> a

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
only shoot 150 180 over you really got a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.670 
only shoot 150 180 over you really got a
lot<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.330> pins<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.750> pick<00:03:18.900> up<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> leaders

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
lot of pins to pick up on the leaders

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.590 
lot of pins to pick up on the leaders
and<00:03:19.890> some<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.130> these<00:03:20.220> other<00:03:20.280> patterns<00:03:20.940> they're

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
and some of these other patterns they're

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.270 
and some of these other patterns they're
not<00:03:21.750> quite<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.110> high<00:03:22.260> scoring<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.100> you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
not quite as high scoring and so it you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.250 
not quite as high scoring and so it you
know<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.700> don't<00:03:23.970> want<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
know you really don't want to be in a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.900 
know you really don't want to be in a
position<00:03:25.410> where<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.920> got<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.250> try<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.489> make<00:03:26.700> up

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
position where you got to try to make up

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.460 
position where you got to try to make up
pins<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> pattern<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.900> doesn't<00:03:28.320> yield

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
pins on a pattern that doesn't yield

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.650 
pins on a pattern that doesn't yield
that<00:03:28.709> highest<00:03:28.890> score<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:30.000> pretty<00:03:30.450> psyched

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
that highest score so I'm pretty psyched

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.120 
that highest score so I'm pretty psyched
I<00:03:31.400> started<00:03:32.400> out<00:03:32.489> with<00:03:32.700> with<00:03:33.150> an<00:03:33.330> outcry<00:03:34.130> which

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
I started out with with an outcry which

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.850 
I started out with with an outcry which
dell<00:03:35.549> light<00:03:36.120> laid<00:03:36.570> out<00:03:36.780> last<00:03:37.290> night<00:03:37.590> right

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
dell light laid out last night right

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.539 
dell light laid out last night right
after<00:03:37.920> our<00:03:38.220> practice<00:03:38.700> session<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.769> I

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
after our practice session and and I

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:42.920 
after our practice session and and I
started<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.000> with<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.510> got<00:03:42.690> four

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
started out with that and I got four

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.080 
started out with that and I got four
games<00:03:43.170> out<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.650> which<00:03:43.950> which<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.489> pretty

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
games out of it which which is pretty

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.509 
games out of it which which is pretty
long<00:03:45.390> for<00:03:45.780> any<00:03:45.930> ball<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.070> start<00:03:47.340> out

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
long for any ball that that I start out

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.250 
long for any ball that that I start out
with<00:03:47.670> using<00:03:48.090> those<00:03:48.239> angles<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.900> know<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.049> try

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
with using those angles you know you try

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.340 
with using those angles you know you try
to<00:03:49.290> keep<00:03:49.530> your<00:03:49.709> ankles<00:03:50.040> closed<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.019> got<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
to keep your ankles closed so I got the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.740 
to keep your ankles closed so I got the
outcry<00:03:52.680> started<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.670> boy<00:03:54.480> did<00:03:54.540> it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
outcry started with that and boy did it

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.810 
outcry started with that and boy did it
looked<00:03:54.930> great<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.320> mean<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:56.130> then<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.370> fell<00:03:56.640> into

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
looked great I mean and then I fell into

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.670 
looked great I mean and then I fell into
a<00:03:56.910> good<00:03:57.180> rhythm<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:58.110> felt<00:03:58.290> like<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:58.530> had

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
a good rhythm and just felt like I had

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.960 
a good rhythm and just felt like I had
to<00:03:58.739> get<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.890> off<00:03:59.010> my<00:03:59.070> hand<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.730> was<00:03:59.820> going

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
to get it off my hand and it was going

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.180 
to get it off my hand and it was going
to<00:04:00.030> strike<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.630> that's<00:04:01.620> always<00:04:01.799> nice<00:04:02.040> when

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
to strike so that's always nice when

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.250 
to strike so that's always nice when
that<00:04:02.400> happens

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.309 

well<00:04:07.330> they<00:04:08.330> were<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.480> little<00:04:08.629> tighter<00:04:08.930> today<00:04:09.260> so

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
well they were a little tighter today so

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.809 
well they were a little tighter today so
guys<00:04:09.680> could<00:04:09.920> use<00:04:10.069> a<00:04:10.099> little<00:04:10.250> stronger<00:04:10.610> balls

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
guys could use a little stronger balls

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.160 
guys could use a little stronger balls
out<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.120> gate<00:04:11.360> there<00:04:11.659> wasn't<00:04:11.900> quite<00:04:12.079> as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
out of the gate there wasn't quite as

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.949 
out of the gate there wasn't quite as
much<00:04:12.290> friction<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.890> right<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.930> when<00:04:14.930> I

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
much friction to the right and when I

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.920 
much friction to the right and when I
saw<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:17.060> guys<00:04:17.239> being<00:04:17.570> able<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.900> use

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
saw the the guys being able to use

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.379 
saw the the guys being able to use
stronger<00:04:18.290> balls<00:04:18.729> it<00:04:19.729> actually<00:04:19.940> cheered<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
stronger balls it actually cheered the

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.810 
stronger balls it actually cheered the
pattern<00:04:20.690> up<00:04:20.840> in<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.049> front<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.530> then<00:04:22.370> once

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
pattern up in the front and then once

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.700 
pattern up in the front and then once
you<00:04:22.970> got<00:04:23.120> into<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.419> certain<00:04:23.630> spot<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.560> could

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
you got into a certain spot you could

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.279 
you got into a certain spot you could
actually<00:04:24.830> ball<00:04:25.160> down<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.820> throw<00:04:26.539> it<00:04:26.690> throw<00:04:27.229> it
