months one is actually gonna be right
here<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.140> let's<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:07.980> if<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.250> angle<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
here and let's see if I can angle it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.450 
here and let's see if I can angle it
correctly<00:02:09.179> yeah<00:02:10.170> walk<00:02:10.890> up<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.430> here

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.030 

and<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.990> ah<00:02:16.230> damn<00:02:17.010> it

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and if I can get it there is ah damn it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.070 
and if I can get it there is ah damn it
but<00:02:17.970> pretty<00:02:18.210> much<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.750> more<00:02:18.900> difficult

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
but pretty much this is a more difficult

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.500 
but pretty much this is a more difficult
plan<00:02:19.440> spot<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> very<00:02:20.760> cool<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.300> um

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
plan spot but this is a very cool one um

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
plan spot but this is a very cool one um
if<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.320> want<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> show<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:22.950> friends<00:02:23.160> or<00:02:23.430> not

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
but I obviously cannot climb this at all

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.120 
but I obviously cannot climb this at all
this<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.110> problem<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.500> may<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.830> if

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
this is one problem you may have if

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.350 
this is one problem you may have if
you're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.550> doing<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.880> plant<00:02:30.150> spot

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you're going to be doing this plant spot

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.170 
you're going to be doing this plant spot
but<00:02:31.110> again<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.770> if<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.400> scooch<00:02:32.940> over<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
but again you can if you scooch over a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.550 
but again you can if you scooch over a
bit<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.840> very<00:02:34.050> corner<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
bit you can see the very corner of the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.650 
bit you can see the very corner of the
bomb<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.670> plant<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> bomb<00:02:36.300> itself

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
bomb and you can plant the bomb itself

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.080 
bomb and you can plant the bomb itself

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
much you don't really need to push out

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.450

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
that it's pretty ridiculous one spot is

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.820 
that it's pretty ridiculous one spot is
this<00:03:40.080> going<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:40.380> simply<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.770> checking

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
this going to be simply just checking

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.410 
this going to be simply just checking
out<00:03:41.220> laying<00:03:41.580> prone<00:03:41.820> you're<00:03:42.030> always<00:03:42.240> going<00:03:42.390> to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
out laying prone you're always going to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.610 
out laying prone you're always going to
be<00:03:42.480> prone<00:03:42.720> because<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.020> you're<00:03:43.140> standing<00:03:43.350> up

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
be prone because if you're standing up

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.620 
be prone because if you're standing up
like<00:03:43.770> here<00:03:44.070> just<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.970> whole<00:03:45.150> time<00:03:45.360> you're<00:03:45.510> going

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
to get to be shot because you can get

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.350 
to get to be shot because you can get
shot<00:03:47.010> from<00:03:47.160> almost<00:03:47.430> any<00:03:47.640> direction<00:03:47.820> up<00:03:48.180> here

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
shot from almost any direction up here

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.850
