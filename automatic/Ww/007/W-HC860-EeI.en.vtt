the<00:05:13.449> 1930s<00:05:14.400> I've<00:05:15.400> been<00:05:15.669> around<00:05:15.879> transmissions

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
the 1930s I've been around transmissions

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.950 
the 1930s I've been around transmissions
all<00:05:16.840> my<00:05:16.990> life<00:05:17.259> and<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:18.159> is<00:05:18.310> my<00:05:18.460> son<00:05:18.520> I<00:05:19.060> was

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
all my life and so is my son I was

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.689 
all my life and so is my son I was
building<00:05:20.229> transmissions<00:05:21.039> before<00:05:21.460> they<00:05:21.610> even

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
building transmissions before they even

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.689 
building transmissions before they even
came<00:05:22.210> out<00:05:22.479> with<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.810> overdrive<00:05:23.289> unit<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:23.949> guess

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
came out with the overdrive unit I guess

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.089 
came out with the overdrive unit I guess
you<00:05:24.879> could<00:05:24.909> say<00:05:25.440> transmissions<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:26.800> my

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
you could say transmissions and my

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.490 
you could say transmissions and my
family<00:05:27.520> blood<00:05:27.819> but<00:05:28.750> through<00:05:28.990> these<00:05:29.199> years

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
family blood but through these years

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.309 
family blood but through these years
I've<00:05:29.789> seen<00:05:30.789> all<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.389> changes<00:05:31.810> they've<00:05:32.020> done

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
I've seen all the changes they've done

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.770 
I've seen all the changes they've done
to<00:05:32.590> all<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:33.159> transmissions<00:05:33.879> to<00:05:34.120> improve<00:05:34.509> them

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
to all the transmissions to improve them

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.230 
to all the transmissions to improve them
and<00:05:35.190> through<00:05:36.190> these<00:05:36.370> years<00:05:36.639> I've<00:05:36.970> learned

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
and through these years I've learned

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.790 
and through these years I've learned
some<00:05:38.080> tricks<00:05:39.210> don't<00:05:40.210> extend<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:41.139> life<00:05:41.409> and

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
some tricks don't extend a life and

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.969 
some tricks don't extend a life and
better<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.970> performance<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.560> transmission

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
better the performance of a transmission

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.939 
better the performance of a transmission
I<00:05:45.520> had<00:05:46.270> 20<00:05:46.630> years<00:05:46.659> experience<00:05:47.080> building
