00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.590
 century which is cited located rather in

 six steps waiting for you if not there 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.949

 and when you get to the top you have 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.000

 any visitor and that is the mistake 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 what do most people do they do 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.780
 not evolve their city we find this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.129
 common mistake everywhere in fact and it does not 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320
 ignore the evolution 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.030
 of the internet the ten years if they are 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.780
 father his youth and no longer attract 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.180
 visitors and even fewer low sales 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 in fact simply before going into 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 the heart of the subject I created a second 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 video in which I give you my 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 complete system to create 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.520
 new game graphics takes by the hand 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.350
 that of you I reveal to you all my 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.670
 complete system to create 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.049
 graphics have created buttons for 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 create banners to create ads 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.560
 have created the formula that catches the eye 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 kathia rock attracts visitors who 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.259
 attracts sales and it's not just 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.430
 me how am I doing this is how you 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.960
 you can do the same thing at 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.909
 you will be able to use the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.860
 same system at home to draw your 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.930
 own personal graphics for your 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.189
 site what your autoresponder for all and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.110
 attract more visitors to your 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 lists and make more people so everything 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 is the second video just below 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 that you will be able to watch everything from 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.590
 after or after so we go back to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.479
 about this error where we see 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.579
 everywhere but the problem is what we 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.939
 see everywhere the sites of the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.070
 fashion and design that dates from the time a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.390
 from the beginnings of the internet makes souls 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 dusty and pimples that do not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.329
 think more about the action of forms 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.920
 that he does not even want to register 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.439
 banners that are anything but 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.549
 attractive and then still his graphics 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.020
 but they are all alike 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.369
 imagine at home 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.079
 pay more attention to objects that 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 are there every day at the same place 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.829
 why because they are there 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.259
 they did not move did not evolve they 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.909
 are part of the decor so we wear it 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.679
 no more expected end when we move 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.569
 this object when we replace with a 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.470
 new object right there right now your 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.989
 attention is drawn 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.940
 but for your site exactly the same 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.980
 thing these are graphics that all the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.209
 world has already seen and reviewed if you warm up 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.160
 the same action buttons the same 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.200
 form the same banner locates 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.239
 exactly in the same place then the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.879
 visitor is not pleased at all 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.590
 now, well, that's the idea 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.590
 to have new graphics that are going 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.010
 attract and your wine the visitors and this 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.630
 drawer 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.799
 I never saw that before me it's 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.810
 original I want to click on it 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.180
 to find out more and you need your 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.799
 site 120.9 you have to give an identity 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.390
 visual to your site 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.310
 it must be dusted must it be 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.420
 something new from unreleased 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.610
 this way you attracted 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.829
 the attention you have a look at you 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.480
 are going to create an identity you have you 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.579
 created your own density you go 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.709
 stand out from the others and see where 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.209
 remember your site that's because 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.590
 frankly of you to me when you 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.019
 arrive on an old suite with 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.880
 old stuff seen and reviewed reheat even 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.650
 if the sales page is good even though the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.230
 sales page is good you buy 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.180
 be sincere me I do not buy why 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.100
 because I'm just saying that this 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.500
 that I will buy as old as the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.450
 is he himself so that's the idea it's 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.100
 to make your own personal graphics 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.410
 to give an identity to your site 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.060
 make it look like you to your 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.040
 identity that you recognize yourself in 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.670
 your site there that this site there is all 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.590
 the weather 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.989
 brand new so your six hours get 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.430
 say it's sylvain 1910 year 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.620
 own costs 9 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.780
 I'm sure its content is worth it 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.520
 to be seen and I'm sure this 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.560
 that he proposes is equally new and game 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.350
 a ride I have for this market 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.940
 products what these wages come not 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.980
 frankly that we and there boom is 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.270
 win here and there tells you how I 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.970
 I'm going to make my own designer my 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.440
 software is not expensive not all of 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.080
 at all it's possible to do with a 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.390
 professional software is completely 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.320
