things<00:02:04.429> won't<00:02:05.030> matter<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:05.630> we<00:02:05.660> do<00:02:06.110> not<00:02:06.289> get<00:02:06.560> far

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
things won't matter if we do not get far

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.889 
things won't matter if we do not get far
in<00:02:07.130> these<00:02:07.280> playoffs<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.090> this<00:02:08.509> point<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
in these playoffs and this point in the

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.240 
in these playoffs and this point in the
game<00:02:08.929> here<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.470> early<00:02:09.679> on<00:02:09.800> in<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.220> first

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
game here it's early on in the first

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.009 
game here it's early on in the first
quarter<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.180> first<00:02:11.420> half<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.750> say<00:02:11.930> it's

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
quarter in the first half so I say it's

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.690 
quarter in the first half so I say it's
pretty<00:02:12.200> late<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> first<00:02:12.650> quarter<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.340> a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
pretty late in the first quarter it's a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.970 
pretty late in the first quarter it's a
pretty<00:02:13.970> back-to-back<00:02:14.720> game<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.350> mean<00:02:15.590> we're

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
games I'm trying my best to not let that

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.520 
games I'm trying my best to not let that
happen<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:42.240> much<00:05:42.480> stuff<00:05:42.750> is<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.350> line

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
happen so much stuff is on the line

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.740 
happen so much stuff is on the line
honestly<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.490> lot<00:05:44.820> of<00:05:44.970> people<00:05:45.240> were<00:05:45.330> expecting

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
honestly a lot of people were expecting

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.150 
honestly a lot of people were expecting
us<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.960> really<00:05:46.110> put<00:05:46.320> up<00:05:46.410> a<00:05:46.500> fight<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.860> series

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
us to really put up a fight the series

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.860 
us to really put up a fight the series
and<00:05:47.370> it's<00:05:47.790> kind<00:05:48.030> of<00:05:48.120> been<00:05:48.240> hard<00:05:48.420> to<00:05:48.540> do<00:05:48.690> so

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
and it's kind of been hard to do so

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.970 
and it's kind of been hard to do so
because<00:05:49.050> I<00:05:49.200> feel<00:05:49.470> like<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.650> we<00:05:49.710> should<00:05:49.890> have

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
because I feel like that we should have

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.340 
because I feel like that we should have
wanted<00:05:50.310> two<00:05:50.550> or<00:05:50.760> three<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.510> first<00:05:51.720> four

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
wanted two or three of the first four

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.190 
wanted two or three of the first four
games<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:53.400> didn't<00:05:53.670> turn<00:05:53.760> out<00:05:53.820> that<00:05:54.000> way<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:54.600> at

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200
