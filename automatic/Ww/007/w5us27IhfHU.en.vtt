00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.050 
little bit about the features of this
guitar<00:00:17.380> because<00:00:17.710> it's<00:00:17.830> pretty<00:00:18.009> unusual<00:00:18.160> it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
guitar because it's pretty unusual it's

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.630 
guitar because it's pretty unusual it's
all<00:00:19.210> carbon<00:00:19.539> fiber<00:00:19.570> first<00:00:20.200> off<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:21.099> that<00:00:21.250> was

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
all carbon fiber first off and that was

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.120 
all carbon fiber first off and that was
a<00:00:21.939> decision<00:00:22.390> so<00:00:23.199> we<00:00:23.349> could<00:00:23.529> go<00:00:23.650> with<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:23.920> one

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
a decision so we could go with the one

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.519 
a decision so we could go with the one

piece hollow neck hollow head

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.249 
piece hollow neck hollow head
construction<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:28.269> idea<00:00:28.599> behind<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:29.080> system

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
construction the idea behind the system

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.410 
construction the idea behind the system
is<00:00:29.769> to<00:00:30.070> be<00:00:30.099> able<00:00:30.250> to<00:00:30.429> have<00:00:30.580> a<00:00:30.609> small<00:00:30.970> guitar

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
is to be able to have a small guitar

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.950 
is to be able to have a small guitar
that<00:00:32.140> has<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.769> full<00:00:33.070> sound<00:00:33.400> one<00:00:33.879> that<00:00:34.089> you<00:00:34.180> take

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
that has a full sound one that you take

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.750 
that has a full sound one that you take
on<00:00:35.170> stage<00:00:35.410> one<00:00:35.470> that<00:00:35.920> you<00:00:35.980> take<00:00:36.160> in<00:00:36.339> the<00:00:36.400> studio

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
on stage one that you take in the studio

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.329 
on stage one that you take in the studio
and<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:37.809> that<00:00:38.379> accounts<00:00:38.620> for<00:00:38.799> the<00:00:38.890> unusual

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339
