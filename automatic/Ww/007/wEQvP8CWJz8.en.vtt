00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
and now for Team Liquid they didn't get

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.290

him<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.860> first<00:00:02.040> week<00:00:02.310> but<00:00:02.550> they<00:00:02.639> still<00:00:02.970> showed

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
him the first week but they still showed

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.360 
him the first week but they still showed
very<00:00:03.720> well<00:00:04.020> so<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.319> lot<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.710> sits<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.130> him

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
very well so a lot of that sits on him

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.320 
very well so a lot of that sits on him
to<00:00:05.790> keep<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.060> going

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
to keep it going

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.600 
to keep it going
I<00:00:06.420> really<00:00:06.810> like<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.379> city<00:00:07.680> carries<00:00:08.160> worst

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I really like the city carries worst

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
I really like the city carries worst
nightmare<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> other<00:00:09.809> hand<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.200> got

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
nightmare but on the other hand you got

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.080 
nightmare but on the other hand you got
a<00:00:10.349> look<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:10.800> Team<00:00:10.950> Liquid<00:00:11.130> did<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
a look at what Team Liquid did and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.970 
a look at what Team Liquid did and
they're<00:00:12.269> okay<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.900> honestly<00:00:13.500> don't<00:00:13.860> think

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
they're okay I honestly don't think

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.709 
they're okay I honestly don't think
playing<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:14.700> real<00:00:14.880> champion<00:00:15.240> matters<00:00:15.599> that

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
playing it's real champion matters that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.410 
playing it's real champion matters that
much<00:00:15.900> because<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:17.190> even<00:00:17.850> though<00:00:17.910> he's<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> really

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
much because I even though he's a really

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
much because I even though he's a really
good<00:00:18.510> player<00:00:18.600> pickle<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.580> it's<00:00:20.580> more<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.060> just

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
good player pickle it it's more of just

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.939 
good player pickle it it's more of just
the<00:00:21.330> team<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:21.900> playing<00:00:22.080> against<00:00:22.529> like

lane<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.869> bit<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.380> when<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
game I'm not really thinking too

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.089 
game I'm not really thinking too
specifically<00:00:28.050> about<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.439> oh<00:00:28.590> yeah<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:28.980> is

a world champion I needed it I know I'll

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.179 
a world champion I needed it I know I'll
perform<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.590> guy<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:31.920> more<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.160> like

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
perform this guy I'm more of like

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.229 
perform this guy I'm more of like
alright<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> win

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
alright what do we have to do to win

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.240 
alright what do we have to do to win
this<00:00:33.360> game<00:00:33.600> what's<00:00:33.960> next<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.829> kind<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> just

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this game what's next and I kind of just

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.620 
this game what's next and I kind of just
think<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> entire<00:00:35.850> map<00:00:36.090> overall

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
think about the entire map overall

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
think about the entire map overall
rather<00:00:37.050> than<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.410> focusing<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.010> player

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
rather than just focusing on one player

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310 
rather than just focusing on one player
so<00:00:38.879> even<00:00:39.090> though<00:00:39.180> he's<00:00:39.360> extremely<00:00:40.079> good

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so even though he's extremely good

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.700 
so even though he's extremely good
player<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.890> hard<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> focus<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.059> them<00:00:42.710> any

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
player it's hard to focus on them any

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170 
player it's hard to focus on them any
key<00:00:43.980> champions<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.730> been<00:00:44.910> released
