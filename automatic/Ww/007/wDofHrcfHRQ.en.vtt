00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
players expect over the next couple of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.399 
players expect over the next couple of
weeks<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> hard<00:01:03.149> work<00:01:03.320> there's<00:01:04.320> no

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
weeks a lot of hard work there's no

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
weeks a lot of hard work there's no
doubt<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.670> they'll<00:01:05.880> have

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
doubt about that you know they'll have

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.090 
doubt about that you know they'll have
to<00:01:06.470> Train<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.619> they've<00:01:07.740> never<00:01:07.770> trained

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to Train like they've never trained

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
to Train like they've never trained
before<00:01:08.220> obviously<00:01:08.490> Club<00:01:08.939> pre-seasons<00:01:09.540> are

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
before obviously Club pre-seasons are

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
before obviously Club pre-seasons are
equally<00:01:10.439> tough<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.310> more<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
equally tough but it's more the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
equally tough but it's more the
competitiveness<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.600> when<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> know

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
competitiveness when you when you know

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
competitiveness when you when you know
you're<00:01:13.350> fighting<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.340> shirt

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you're fighting for that for that shirt

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760 
you're fighting for that for that shirt
and<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.909> squad<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.049> that'll<00:01:16.320> push<00:01:16.500> players

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and that squad and that'll push players

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
and that squad and that'll push players
to<00:01:16.979> different<00:01:17.310> 2<00:01:18.060> levels<00:01:18.330> than<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.600> been<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
to different 2 levels than have been to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
to different 2 levels than have been to
before<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> first<00:01:20.580> three

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
before and so I think the first three

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.980 
before and so I think the first three
weeks<00:01:21.030> will<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.360> will<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.540> tough<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
weeks will be will be tough on the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
weeks will be will be tough on the
players<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> think

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
players but so it should be I think

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
players but so it should be I think
we're<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> Denver<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.320> should<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.590> even
