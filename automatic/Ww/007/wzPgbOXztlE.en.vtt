way but it does fit doesn't make arias

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.390 
way but it does fit doesn't make arias
very<00:02:33.420> back-heavy<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:37.769> only<00:02:37.950> way<00:02:38.040> really<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
very back-heavy the only way really to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.170 
very back-heavy the only way really to
resolve<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.590> probably<00:02:41.519> would<00:02:41.910> want

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
resolve that is you probably would want

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.490 
resolve that is you probably would want
to<00:02:43.910> rotate<00:02:44.910> these<00:02:45.329> around<00:02:45.390> maybe<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.380> don't

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
to rotate these around maybe I don't

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.039 
to rotate these around maybe I don't
know<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.120> I'm<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.150> gonna<00:02:48.450> waste<00:02:48.599> time<00:02:48.870> doing

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
know but I'm not gonna waste time doing

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:56.539 
know but I'm not gonna waste time doing
that<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:50.069> he<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:54.650> with<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.860> archer<00:02:56.340> path

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
that but here he is with the archer path

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.589 
that but here he is with the archer path
on<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.660> said<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.019> very<00:02:58.079> back<00:02:58.620> heavy<00:02:58.920> and

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
on like I said it's very back heavy and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.420 
on like I said it's very back heavy and
is<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.810> his<00:03:01.170> legs<00:03:01.680> are<00:03:01.920> too<00:03:01.950> long<00:03:02.160> for<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
is the his legs are too long for the the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.390 
is the his legs are too long for the the
bottom<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.610> party<00:03:05.970> pad<00:03:06.180> touched<00:03:06.510> around

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
bottom of the party pad touched around

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680 
bottom of the party pad touched around
so<00:03:08.400> probably<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.940> only<00:03:09.060> way<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.269> pose<00:03:09.510> him

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
so probably the only way to pose him

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.420 
so probably the only way to pose him
with<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.019> pack<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.400> display<00:03:11.819> stand<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
with the pack is on a display stand and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.210 
with the pack is on a display stand and
-<00:03:14.430> ayup<00:03:14.730> done<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.239> already<00:03:15.420> he<00:03:15.989> looks<00:03:16.230> good

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.270

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.660 

remove<00:03:40.870> care<00:03:41.200> Toombs<00:03:41.379> Jean<00:03:41.799> Drive<00:03:44.549> should<00:03:45.549> be

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
remove care Toombs Jean Drive should be

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.640 
remove care Toombs Jean Drive should be
too<00:03:45.970> hard<00:03:47.250> put<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.430> aside<00:03:48.659> you<00:03:49.659> want<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.230> part

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
too hard put that aside you want to part

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.860 
too hard put that aside you want to part
these<00:03:50.950> thruster<00:03:51.700> packs<00:03:51.940> here<00:03:52.120> just<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.540> little

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
these thruster packs here just a little

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.369 
these thruster packs here just a little
bit<00:03:53.790> then<00:03:54.790> instead<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.629> attaching<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.170> this

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
bit then instead of attaching it this

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.710 
bit then instead of attaching it this
way<00:03:56.680> where<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.310> bottom<00:03:57.640> skirt<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.390> pointed

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
way where the bottom skirt is pointed

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.789 
way where the bottom skirt is pointed
downward<00:03:59.069> flip<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.610> way<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.599> that<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.959> so

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
downward flip it that way so that the so

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.680 
downward flip it that way so that the so
that<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.280> black<00:04:03.700> party<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.090> pointing<00:04:04.420> upward

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
that this black party is pointing upward

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.680 
that this black party is pointing upward
then<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.709> just<00:04:05.890> plug<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.190> in<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.760> should<00:04:07.209> fit

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
then you just plug it in it should fit

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.210 
then you just plug it in it should fit
right<00:04:08.019> in<00:04:08.500> between<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:09.099> thrusters<00:04:11.099> again<00:04:12.099> it

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
right in between the thrusters again it

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.619 
right in between the thrusters again it
won't<00:04:12.340> fit<00:04:12.670> in<00:04:12.790> there<00:04:12.879> all<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.090> way<00:04:13.299> can

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
won't fit in there all the way can

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:21.110 
won't fit in there all the way can
entirely<00:04:14.200> completely

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.310 

there<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.900> go

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.810 

and<00:04:25.830> now<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:28.550> Kerrigan<00:04:29.550> Archer<00:04:31.820> with

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
and now you have Kerrigan Archer with

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.140 
and now you have Kerrigan Archer with
doing<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.900> way<00:04:33.960> will<00:04:35.420> allow<00:04:36.420> for<00:04:36.860> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
doing it this way will allow for the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.180 
doing it this way will allow for the
tips<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.570> stay<00:04:40.260> on<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> ground<00:04:40.650> so<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:40.920> can

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
tips to stay on the ground so you can

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.410 
tips to stay on the ground so you can
have<00:04:42.060> them<00:04:42.180> standing<00:04:42.570> with<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:44.150> that's<00:04:45.150> if

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
have them standing with it but that's if

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.000 
have them standing with it but that's if
you<00:04:45.510> want<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.780> keep<00:04:45.870> them<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.140> ground<00:04:46.170> you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
you want to keep them on the ground you

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.540 
you want to keep them on the ground you
can<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.610> flip<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.060> over<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:49.650> path<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.340> can

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
can just flip it over the path you can

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.790 
can just flip it over the path you can
just<00:04:50.700> flip<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:50.970> over<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.600> do<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.530> normal

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
just flip it over and do it the normal

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.200 
just flip it over and do it the normal
way<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:52.980> have<00:04:53.280> them<00:04:53.370> gonna<00:04:53.460> stand<00:04:53.760> -<00:04:54.000> that

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
way and have them gonna stand - that

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.650 
way and have them gonna stand - that
looks<00:04:54.390> just<00:04:54.570> as<00:04:54.810> good<00:04:55.160> but<00:04:56.160> yeah<00:04:57.000> for<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> most

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
looks just as good but yeah for the most

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.220 
looks just as good but yeah for the most
part<00:04:58.700> that's<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.910> extra<00:05:00.540> docking<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:01.110> the

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
part that's the extra docking for the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.210 
part that's the extra docking for the
Archer<00:05:01.500> pack<00:05:01.740> I<00:05:03.260> checked<00:05:04.260> for<00:05:04.350> Savi<00:05:04.950> there's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
Archer pack I checked for Savi there's

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.490 
Archer pack I checked for Savi there's
really<00:05:05.610> no<00:05:05.880> way<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.150> can<00:05:06.390> put<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:06.840> CeraVe

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
really no way you can put that on CeraVe

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.620 
really no way you can put that on CeraVe
unfortunately<00:05:10.190> but<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.700> mean<00:05:12.150> oh<00:05:12.270> well<00:05:12.450> we're

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
unfortunately but I mean oh well we're

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.090 
unfortunately but I mean oh well we're
getting<00:05:12.750> this<00:05:13.080> era<00:05:13.320> from<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.590> pack<00:05:13.770> anyway

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
getting this era from the pack anyway

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.980 
getting this era from the pack anyway
but<00:05:15.030> yeah<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:17.280> just<00:05:17.880> amps<00:05:18.330> up<00:05:18.450> my<00:05:18.600> score<00:05:18.930> for

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
but yeah this just amps up my score for

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.250 
but yeah this just amps up my score for
Oreos<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:20.040> Oreos<00:05:20.790> but<00:05:21.120> I'm<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.690> gun<00:05:21.900> Archer

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
Oreos that Oreos but I'm the gun Archer

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.770 
Oreos that Oreos but I'm the gun Archer
the<00:05:23.040> robot<00:05:23.700> mode<00:05:23.910> for<00:05:24.090> gunner<00:05:24.240> Archer<00:05:24.510> still

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
the robot mode for gunner Archer still

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.930 
the robot mode for gunner Archer still
stays<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.080> same<00:05:25.140> as<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.530> nine<00:05:25.770> but<00:05:28.940> actually

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
stays the same as a nine but actually

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.740 
stays the same as a nine but actually
all

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.420 

I'm<00:05:34.230> gonna<00:05:34.380> change<00:05:34.680> up<00:05:34.800> my<00:05:34.890> rating<00:05:35.160> system

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
I'm gonna change up my rating system

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
before I did this and realized this I

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.470

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.220 
would have given the overall kit and
eight<00:06:25.010> because<00:06:26.480> if<00:06:27.480> you<00:06:27.630> were<00:06:27.750> to<00:06:27.810> get<00:06:28.020> about

itself

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.250 
itself
there<00:06:28.890> was<00:06:29.100> really<00:06:29.340> no<00:06:29.550> point<00:06:29.850> but<00:06:30.180> and<00:06:30.750> then

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
there was really no point but and then

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.540 
there was really no point but and then
the<00:06:31.380> only<00:06:31.560> two<00:06:31.860> things<00:06:32.070> could<00:06:32.220> do<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.460> they

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
the only two things could do it they

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.100 
the only two things could do it they
stopped<00:06:32.850> with<00:06:33.000> arias<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:33.480> double<00:06:33.780> oh<00:06:33.900> it's

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
stopped with arias and double oh it's

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.500 
stopped with arias and double oh it's
nice<00:06:34.380> but<00:06:34.770> now<00:06:35.610> that<00:06:35.730> I<00:06:35.790> realize<00:06:36.090> you<00:06:36.180> can<00:06:36.300> top

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
nice but now that I realize you can top

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.290 
nice but now that I realize you can top
it<00:06:36.540> with<00:06:36.840> arias<00:06:37.350> in<00:06:37.620> robot<00:06:37.950> mode<00:06:37.980> and<00:06:38.430> care

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
it with arias in robot mode and care

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.110 
it with arias in robot mode and care
demon<00:06:39.660> robot<00:06:39.990> mode<00:06:40.200> that<00:06:41.190> just<00:06:41.460> adds<00:06:41.700> for<00:06:42.090> a

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
demon robot mode that just adds for a

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.630 
demon robot mode that just adds for a
lot<00:06:42.480> more<00:06:42.690> playability<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:43.590> I'm<00:06:43.800> boosting<00:06:44.130> its

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
lot more playability so I'm boosting its

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.710 
lot more playability so I'm boosting its
overall<00:06:46.010> intended<00:06:47.010> eight<00:06:47.250> to<00:06:47.880> probably

overall intended eight to probably

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.460 
overall intended eight to probably
attend<00:06:49.050> just<00:06:49.320> because<00:06:49.680> of<00:06:49.800> flexibility<00:06:51.470> but

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470
