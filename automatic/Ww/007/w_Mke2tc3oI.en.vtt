 hello good to two kids here the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.970
 gamers sb and good as you see this is the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.300
 Spotlight skin 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.950
 of ivory glacial marketer and good the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.190
 truth is that the skin is very cool 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.310
 and well, we're going there 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:35.980
 they change what are two attacks that are 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.570
 the cv and the vale and see you later 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.080
 Everything else is the same but the truth is 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.190
 which is the skin that I liked the most and 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.110
 that maybe one day I bought it and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.640
 so is 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.400
 but good is the one that I liked the most 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 The truth is that that's why I do it 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.850
 first voucher 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.820
 and well let's try what are the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.930
 attacks 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.930
 I use the q 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.960
 and you have seen it good has seen a 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.830
 little bad so now I'll repeat it 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.520
 and well there you have the one that has changed 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.110
 quite 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.600
 there you have again the cuca was if you are 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.870
 the best and there you have the r that does not change 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.830
 nothing 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.320
 and you have again the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.480
 and even for what you see there you have the w 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.070
 what he does is change the 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.040
 color put it that way one with the blue plus 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.040
 dark is worth it now I'm going to use it again 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.400
 so you can see it up close 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.310
 and good as it is is a blue like that more 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.020
 darker 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.799
 nothing else changes 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.289
 and that's it, this is the ivory skin 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.550
 the changes and so and so now you can 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.510
 make them put the animations 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.510
 and it is already 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.979
 like shift 4 and well then 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.750

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.349
