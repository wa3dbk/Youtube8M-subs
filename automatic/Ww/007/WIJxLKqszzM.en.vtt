black<00:00:00.630> magic<00:00:00.840> studio<00:00:01.350> cameras<00:00:01.829> are<00:00:01.979> fantastic

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
black magic studio cameras are fantastic

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.090 
black magic studio cameras are fantastic
and<00:00:02.909> really<00:00:03.000> visionary<00:00:03.480> cameras<00:00:04.200> one<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:04.980> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
and really visionary cameras one of the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.980 
and really visionary cameras one of the
things<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.580> like<00:00:05.819> so<00:00:06.210> much<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.420> them<00:00:06.870> is

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
things that I like so much about them is

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.560 
things that I like so much about them is
how<00:00:07.290> they<00:00:07.500> used<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.010> SDI<00:00:08.460> return<00:00:08.970> signal<00:00:09.420> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
how they used the SDI return signal to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.190 
how they used the SDI return signal to
carry<00:00:09.929> data<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.679> CCU<00:00:11.130> operation<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.870> can

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
carry data for CCU operation so you can

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.620 
carry data for CCU operation so you can
use<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> ATM<00:00:13.860> software<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.639> control<00:00:15.120> master

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
use the ATM software to control master

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.990 
use the ATM software to control master
black<00:00:15.990> iris<00:00:16.560> color<00:00:16.859> correct<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> image<00:00:17.730> set

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
black iris color correct the image set

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
black iris color correct the image set
the<00:00:18.180> white<00:00:18.570> balance<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> shutter<00:00:19.529> speed

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the white balance of the shutter speed

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.960 
the white balance of the shutter speed
or<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.460> could<00:00:20.640> use<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> Skaro<00:00:22.340> CCU<00:00:23.369> remote

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
or you could use one of Skaro CCU remote

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.689 
or you could use one of Skaro CCU remote
we<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> same<00:00:26.369> things

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
we have right here to do the same things

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.480 
we have right here to do the same things
but<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.080> problems<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.740> these<00:00:28.980> cameras

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
but one of the problems of these cameras

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
but one of the problems of these cameras
is<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.480> has<00:00:30.630> been<00:00:30.660> no<00:00:30.929> suitable

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
is that there has been no suitable

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.720 
is that there has been no suitable
lenses<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.170> thing<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> people

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
lenses for them so one thing that people

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
lenses for them so one thing that people
get<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> idea<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:36.809> old<00:00:37.020> broadcast

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
get the idea is to take an old broadcast

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.720 
get the idea is to take an old broadcast
lens<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.219> b4

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
lens at b4

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.209 
lens at b4
mount<00:00:39.149> lens<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.260> these<00:00:40.410> cameras<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
mount lens and put on these cameras and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
mount lens and put on these cameras and
it<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> possible<00:00:42.239> using<00:00:42.540> an<00:00:42.809> adapter<00:00:43.290> from

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it is possible using an adapter from

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.819 
it is possible using an adapter from
micro<00:00:43.920> four-thirds<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:45.120> b4<00:00:45.600> mount<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.770> here

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
micro four-thirds to b4 mount right here

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
micro four-thirds to b4 mount right here
you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> those<00:00:48.329> adapters<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.960> two

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you can have those adapters in two

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
you can have those adapters in two
flavors<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> small<00:00:50.850> glass<00:00:51.210> inside

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
flavors one with a small glass inside

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
flavors one with a small glass inside
and<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.620> without<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and one without that's not really the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.619 
and one without that's not really the
issue<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.020> problem<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.399> there's<00:00:56.760> no<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
issue the problem is that there's no way

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.220 
issue the problem is that there's no way
the<00:00:58.379> studio<00:00:58.770> cameras<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.550> control<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.600> iris

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the studio cameras can control the iris

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.889 
the studio cameras can control the iris
that<00:01:01.649> sits<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.609> lens<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that sits in the lens and not in the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.170 
that sits in the lens and not in the
camera<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.420> we<00:01:06.420> made<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.960> box<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
camera but we made a box for that the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.750 
camera but we made a box for that the
basics<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.840> CCU<00:01:10.439> operation<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.189> controlling

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
basics of CCU operation is controlling

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.630 
basics of CCU operation is controlling
the<00:01:11.880> iris<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.020> master<00:01:13.320> black<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the iris and the master black so on a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
the iris and the master black so on a
sky-high<00:01:15.030> CCU<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.930> controller<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.650> this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
sky-high CCU like controller like this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
sky-high CCU like controller like this
one<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.000> knobs<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> iris<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
one you have knobs for the iris and the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
one you have knobs for the iris and the
master<00:01:19.950> black<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.090> turn<00:01:21.390> these<00:01:21.600> knobs

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
master black and as I turn these knobs

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690 
master black and as I turn these knobs
you<00:01:22.049> will<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> item<00:01:23.189> software

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you will see the item software

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
you will see the item software
recognizes<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.600> commands<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.229> sends<00:01:25.650> data

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
recognizes the commands and sends data

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
recognizes the commands and sends data
on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> STI<00:01:26.610> return<00:01:27.030> signal<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> camera

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
on the STI return signal to the camera

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
on the STI return signal to the camera
so<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:29.280> look<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> software<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.270> master

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so just look in the software how master

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.020 
so just look in the software how master
black<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.079> move<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.530> handle<00:01:32.040> sideways<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
black will move this handle sideways and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
black will move this handle sideways and
the<00:01:33.720> same<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.110> camera<00:01:34.380> two<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> turn

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the same for camera two and as I turn

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
the same for camera two and as I turn
the<00:01:35.340> iris<00:01:35.640> knob<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> goes<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.540> down<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.380> we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the iris knob it goes up and down and we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
the iris knob it goes up and down and we
can<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> these<00:01:38.460> effects<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
can see some of these effects on the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
can see some of these effects on the
multiviewer<00:01:39.840> behind<00:01:40.200> me<00:01:40.350> where<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.890> the

if<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.820> turn<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.210> master<00:01:45.390> black<00:01:45.780> knob<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.290> can

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
if I turn the master black knob you can

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.789 
if I turn the master black knob you can
see<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.829> from<00:01:47.070> milky<00:01:47.579> white<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:49.500> hard

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
see I go from milky white to really hard

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
see I go from milky white to really hard
black<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.110> same<00:01:52.320> for

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
black you can see here and the same for

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.910 
black you can see here and the same for
the<00:01:52.680> other<00:01:52.829> camera<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> those<00:01:54.030> settings<00:01:54.540> are

the other camera and those settings are
communicated<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> cameras<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> SDI

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
communicated to the cameras on the SDI

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.770 
communicated to the cameras on the SDI
return<00:01:57.990> signal<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.969> camera<00:02:00.420> itself

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
return signal and the camera itself

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
return signal and the camera itself
internally<00:02:01.320> will<00:02:02.100> use<00:02:02.310> these<00:02:02.520> parameters<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
internally will use these parameters to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.109 
internally will use these parameters to
give<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> other<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
give the one or the other look but the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
give the one or the other look but the
problem<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.020> turn<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> Irish<00:02:07.950> knob<00:02:08.190> over

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
problem is if I turn the Irish knob over

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.780 
problem is if I turn the Irish knob over
here<00:02:08.780> nothing<00:02:09.780> happens<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.410> why<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.489> said

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
here nothing happens and why as I said

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
here nothing happens and why as I said
because<00:02:12.080> iris<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
because iris is in the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.210 
because iris is in the
and<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:15.570> lenses<00:02:15.930> controlled<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.770> powered<00:02:17.190> by

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and the lenses controlled and powered by

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.190 
and the lenses controlled and powered by
this<00:02:17.460> cable<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.350> is<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> regular<00:02:20.100> old<00:02:20.370> SD

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
this cable so this is a regular old SD

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.870 
this cable so this is a regular old SD
broadcast<00:02:22.200> camera<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> see<00:02:23.700> how

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
broadcast camera and there you see how

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.680 
broadcast camera and there you see how
the<00:02:23.940> lens<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.730> attached<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.210> camera

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the lens here is attached to the camera

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.680 
the lens here is attached to the camera
through<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.500> pluck<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.090> detach<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
through this pluck you can detach it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.540 
through this pluck you can detach it
like<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.290> unmount<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.070> lens<00:02:32.310> if

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
like this you can unmount the lens if

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.290 
like this you can unmount the lens if
you<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.380> over<00:02:34.380> here<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:36.120> we

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
you like and over here this is what we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.020 
you like and over here this is what we
miss<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:37.170> miss<00:02:37.380> something<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:38.130> give<00:02:38.310> power<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
miss we miss something to give power and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.960 
miss we miss something to give power and
iris<00:02:39.480> instructions<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.500> lens<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.070> this

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
iris instructions to the lens and this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.330 
iris instructions to the lens and this
is<00:02:42.150> where<00:02:42.420> our<00:02:42.630> blue<00:02:43.170> box<00:02:43.530> comes<00:02:43.890> into<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
is where our blue box comes into the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.470 
is where our blue box comes into the
picture<00:02:44.520> because<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> has<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> high<00:02:46.200> rose<00:02:46.500> as

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
picture because it has a high rose as

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.790 
picture because it has a high rose as
12-pin<00:02:48.480> connector<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:49.380> which<00:02:49.620> is

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
12-pin connector here which is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160 
12-pin connector here which is
compatible<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.760> these<00:02:50.910> lenses<00:02:51.210> okay<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:51.990> you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
compatible with these lenses okay so you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.400 
compatible with these lenses okay so you
plug<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:53.720> there<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.840> go

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
plug it in there you go

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.020 
plug it in there you go
you<00:02:55.770> now<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.550> Howard<00:02:57.360> limbs<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:59.030> have

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you now have a Howard limbs and you have

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.620 
you now have a Howard limbs and you have
the<00:03:00.270> iris<00:03:01.230> parameters<00:03:02.100> communicated<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the iris parameters communicated to the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.620 
the iris parameters communicated to the
lenses<00:03:04.080> okay<00:03:04.710> let's<00:03:05.100> see<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.670> works<00:03:05.910> if<00:03:06.300> I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
lenses okay let's see that it works if I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.900 
lenses okay let's see that it works if I
turn<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.140> knob<00:03:07.170> here<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:08.430> should<00:03:08.670> see<00:03:08.880> that

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
turn the knob here we should see that

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.480 
turn the knob here we should see that
the<00:03:09.390> Irish<00:03:10.050> are<00:03:10.290> maybe<00:03:10.650> let<00:03:10.890> me<00:03:11.010> just<00:03:11.280> adjust

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
the Irish are maybe let me just adjust

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.580 
the Irish are maybe let me just adjust
the<00:03:11.850> black<00:03:12.030> level<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.420> little<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.320> can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the black level a little bit so I can

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.420 
the black level a little bit so I can
turn<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.980> iris<00:03:14.340> down<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:19.590> here

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
turn the iris down and see the and here

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520 
turn the iris down and see the and here
you<00:03:20.640> see<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> same<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.510> control<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.080> Irish

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
you see the same I can control the Irish

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.660 
you see the same I can control the Irish
now<00:03:23.450> for<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.870> second<00:03:25.260> camera<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:26.220> last<00:03:26.400> part

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
now for the second camera the last part

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.550 
now for the second camera the last part
of<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:26.880> video<00:03:27.060> will<00:03:27.420> be<00:03:27.540> dedicated<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.200> some

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
of this video will be dedicated to some

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.670 
of this video will be dedicated to some
details<00:03:29.070> about<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.850> technology<00:03:30.440> let's<00:03:31.440> start

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
details about the technology let's start

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.010 
details about the technology let's start
over<00:03:31.890> here<00:03:32.130> we<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.459> an<00:03:32.580> ATM<00:03:32.970> switcher<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
over here we have an ATM switcher and it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.530 
over here we have an ATM switcher and it
talks<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.860> sky<00:03:35.489> high<00:03:35.670> C<00:03:36.000> GU<00:03:36.300> light

talks to a sky high C GU light
controller<00:03:37.320> here<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:39.390> controller<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.230> turns

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
controller here this controller in turns

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.420 
controller here this controller in turns
talked<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> 8<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.420> B<00:03:42.840> 4<00:03:43.230> link<00:03:43.470> boxes<00:03:43.980> over

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
talked to the 8 and B 4 link boxes over

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.330 
talked to the 8 and B 4 link boxes over
here<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:46.050> reason<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:46.440> doing<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.920> is

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
here and the reason for doing that is

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.090 
here and the reason for doing that is
that<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.850> ATM<00:03:48.360> switcher<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.050> only<00:03:49.320> handle

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
that the ATM switcher can only handle

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.120 
that the ATM switcher can only handle
simultaneous<00:03:51.030> connections<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:52.260> between<00:03:52.590> 4

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
simultaneous connections to between 4

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.270 
simultaneous connections to between 4
and<00:03:53.400> 8<00:03:53.640> different<00:03:54.300> clients<00:03:55.230> at<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.800> same<00:03:55.980> time

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
and 8 different clients at the same time

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.750 
and 8 different clients at the same time
and<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.610> depends<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.300> ATM<00:03:57.690> model<00:03:58.760> so

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
and that depends on the ATM model so

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.270 
and that depends on the ATM model so
what<00:04:00.300> we<00:04:00.480> did<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:01.110> solve<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.560> problem<00:04:02.130> of

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
what we did to solve this problem of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.600 
what we did to solve this problem of
capacity<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.930> take<00:04:04.170> our<00:04:04.410> CCU<00:04:05.100> controller

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
capacity is to take our CCU controller

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.150 
capacity is to take our CCU controller
and<00:04:05.850> make<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.450> master<00:04:07.380> station<00:04:07.650> for<00:04:08.070> the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
and make it a master station for the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.550 
and make it a master station for the
befalling<00:04:08.970> boxes<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.690> what<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.019> does<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.410> it

befalling boxes so what it does it it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.770 
befalling boxes so what it does it it
takes<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.340> iris<00:04:11.820> values<00:04:12.209> from<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.540> switch

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
takes the iris values from the switch

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.740 
takes the iris values from the switch
and<00:04:13.130> distributes<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.670> each<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.510> boxes

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
and distributes to each of the boxes

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.800 
and distributes to each of the boxes
sitting<00:04:16.620> with<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.340> camera<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.269> happens

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
sitting with the camera and that happens

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.279 
sitting with the camera and that happens
over<00:04:19.620> Ethernet<00:04:20.519> finally<00:04:21.419> let's<00:04:21.690> look<00:04:21.870> at<00:04:22.020> some

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
over Ethernet finally let's look at some

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.370 
over Ethernet finally let's look at some
specific<00:04:22.919> details<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.000> befalling<00:04:24.750> box

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
specific details of the befalling box

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.140 
specific details of the befalling box
but<00:04:25.919> before<00:04:26.190> we<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.640> would<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
but before we do that I would like to

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.470 
but before we do that I would like to
share

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
share

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.600

how<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.720> Irish<00:04:28.170> ring<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.530> actually<00:04:28.950> moving<00:04:29.220> as

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
how the Irish ring is actually moving as

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.690 
how the Irish ring is actually moving as
I<00:04:29.880> move<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.590> Irish<00:04:31.590> parameters<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.310> can<00:04:32.340> see

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
I move the Irish parameters you can see

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.330 
I move the Irish parameters you can see
that<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.870> control<00:04:34.290> signal<00:04:34.710> coming<00:04:34.950> from<00:04:35.100> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
that the control signal coming from the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.900 
that the control signal coming from the
b4<00:04:35.820> lens<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.840> b4<00:04:37.200> link<00:04:37.470> box<00:04:37.860> will<00:04:38.550> move<00:04:38.730> the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
b4 lens the b4 link box will move the

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.570 
b4 lens the b4 link box will move the
iris<00:04:39.180> ring<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:40.410> that's<00:04:40.620> nice

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
iris ring so that's nice

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.060 
iris ring so that's nice

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
specific features of the box we have 12

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.830 
specific features of the box we have 12
volt<00:04:44.250> power<00:04:44.430> supply<00:04:44.640> in<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.240> doesn't<00:04:45.660> supply

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
volt power supply in it doesn't supply

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.630 
volt power supply in it doesn't supply
just<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.350> box<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.710> also<00:04:46.860> supplies<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.550> the

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
just the box it also supplies to the

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.050 
just the box it also supplies to the
lens

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060

motors<00:04:48.690> we<00:04:49.320> have<00:04:49.410> Ethernet<00:04:49.890> connection<00:04:50.370> here

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
motors we have Ethernet connection here

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.470 
motors we have Ethernet connection here
and<00:04:50.940> then<00:04:51.270> on<00:04:51.540> this<00:04:51.930> side<00:04:51.990> we<00:04:52.920> have<00:04:53.480> lens

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
and then on this side we have lens

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.950 
and then on this side we have lens
connection<00:04:54.960> we<00:04:55.740> have<00:04:55.920> Irish<00:04:56.670> control<00:04:57.240> on/off

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
connection we have Irish control on/off

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.470 
connection we have Irish control on/off
so<00:04:58.830> basically<00:04:59.280> what<00:04:59.490> happens<00:04:59.820> if<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.060> turn<00:05:00.120> this

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
so basically what happens if I turn this

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.080 
so basically what happens if I turn this
off<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.230> can<00:05:01.530> now<00:05:01.710> move<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.400> iris<00:05:02.820> ring

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
off is that I can now move the iris ring

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.200 
off is that I can now move the iris ring
manually<00:05:03.890> but<00:05:04.890> as<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.220> can<00:05:05.370> see<00:05:05.580> as<00:05:05.730> soon<00:05:05.820> as<00:05:06.120> I

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
manually but as you can see as soon as I

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.450 
manually but as you can see as soon as I
turn<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.480> on<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.380> can<00:05:07.500> see<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.920> iris<00:05:08.250> ring

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
turn it on you can see the iris ring

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.610 
turn it on you can see the iris ring
will<00:05:08.670> go<00:05:08.880> back<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.450> position<00:05:09.630> program

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
will go back to the position program

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.210 
will go back to the position program
from<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.040> ATM<00:05:11.370> switcher<00:05:11.960> then<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:12.990> also<00:05:13.230> have<00:05:13.590> a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
from the ATM switcher then I also have a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.690 
from the ATM switcher then I also have a
preview<00:05:14.910> tele<00:05:15.240> plug<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:16.500> here<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.220> just<00:05:17.250> made<00:05:17.670> a

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
preview tele plug so here I just made a

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.650 
preview tele plug so here I just made a
really<00:05:18.240> simple<00:05:19.220> LED<00:05:20.220> what<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:20.910> will<00:05:21.030> do<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.480> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
really simple LED what it will do is it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.010 
really simple LED what it will do is it
will<00:05:21.810> show<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:24.450> will<00:05:24.660> light<00:05:24.840> up<00:05:24.990> green

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
will show you the it will light up green

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.340 
will show you the it will light up green
when<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.250> channel<00:05:26.610> or<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.660> input<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.110> the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
when the channel or the input of the

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.080 
when the channel or the input of the
items<00:05:28.680> which<00:05:28.860> are<00:05:28.980> connected<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.520> this<00:05:29.640> camera

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
items which are connected to this camera

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.210 
items which are connected to this camera
is<00:05:30.240> unpretty

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
is unpretty

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.580 
is unpretty
the<00:05:32.220> operator<00:05:32.730> of<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:33.000> camera<00:05:33.420> can<00:05:33.960> see<00:05:33.990> if

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
the operator of the camera can see if

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.640 
the operator of the camera can see if
the<00:05:35.130> camera<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.660> unproven<00:05:36.660> likely<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:37.500> be

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
the camera is unproven likely to be

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.360 
the camera is unproven likely to be
selected<00:05:38.160> for<00:05:38.310> a<00:05:38.370> program<00:05:38.880> next<00:05:39.450> of<00:05:40.370> course

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
selected for a program next of course

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.760 
selected for a program next of course
you<00:05:41.670> wouldn't<00:05:41.970> just<00:05:42.600> put<00:05:42.690> an<00:05:42.930> LED<00:05:43.350> on<00:05:43.380> this

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
you wouldn't just put an LED on this

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.260 
you wouldn't just put an LED on this
plug<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.250> would<00:05:44.400> have<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.550> cable<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.180> you

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
plug you would have a cable and you

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.510 
plug you would have a cable and you
would<00:05:45.420> somehow<00:05:45.660> put<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.140> LED<00:05:46.290> close<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:47.010> the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
would somehow put the LED close to the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.810 
would somehow put the LED close to the
monitor<00:05:47.780> here<00:05:48.780> that's<00:05:49.740> the<00:05:50.220> point<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:50.610> course

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
monitor here that's the point of course

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.050 
monitor here that's the point of course
but<00:05:51.320> it's<00:05:52.320> very<00:05:52.800> nice<00:05:53.040> to<00:05:53.070> have<00:05:53.370> preview<00:05:53.820> tally

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
but it's very nice to have preview tally

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.940 
but it's very nice to have preview tally
which<00:05:54.330> is<00:05:54.510> not<00:05:54.720> provided<00:05:55.230> by<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.440> returned

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
which is not provided by the returned

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.760 
which is not provided by the returned
SDI<00:05:56.400> signals<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.180> then<00:05:57.870> finally<00:05:58.260> you<00:05:58.380> have<00:05:58.590> a

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
SDI signals and then finally you have a

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.680 
SDI signals and then finally you have a
camera<00:05:59.310> number<00:05:59.550> selector<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.390> can<00:06:00.540> see

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
camera number selector so you can see

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.330 
camera number selector so you can see
this<00:06:00.870> camera<00:06:01.080> is<00:06:01.320> camera<00:06:01.650> number<00:06:01.920> two<00:06:02.100> and

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
this camera is camera number two and

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.150 
this camera is camera number two and
that<00:06:03.150> is<00:06:03.300> determined<00:06:03.870> by<00:06:04.050> this<00:06:04.110> binary<00:06:04.680> dips

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
that is determined by this binary dips

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.550 
that is determined by this binary dips
which<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.580> have<00:06:05.730> right<00:06:05.940> here<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:06.660> just<00:06:07.380> with<00:06:07.530> a

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
which I have right here so just with a

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.260 
which I have right here so just with a
tiny<00:06:07.890> screwdriver<00:06:08.220> you<00:06:08.670> could<00:06:08.850> turn<00:06:09.030> this

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
tiny screwdriver you could turn this

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.650 
tiny screwdriver you could turn this
knob<00:06:09.480> around<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.700> select<00:06:11.700> another<00:06:12.150> camera

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
knob around and select another camera

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.680 
knob around and select another camera
now<00:06:13.260> I<00:06:13.290> said<00:06:13.710> it<00:06:13.740> in<00:06:13.950> position<00:06:14.370> zero<00:06:14.910> this<00:06:15.420> will

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
now I said it in position zero this will

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.430 
now I said it in position zero this will
actually<00:06:16.050> give<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:17.840> it's<00:06:18.840> just<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.230> neutral

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
actually give you a it's just a neutral

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.330 
actually give you a it's just a neutral
position<00:06:19.860> so<00:06:20.790> it<00:06:21.090> will<00:06:21.590> do<00:06:22.590> nothing<00:06:22.770> basically

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
position so it will do nothing basically

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.820 
position so it will do nothing basically
if<00:06:23.520> I<00:06:23.610> move<00:06:23.850> it<00:06:24.000> up<00:06:24.210> to<00:06:24.270> nine<00:06:24.780> we<00:06:25.200> have<00:06:25.410> on<00:06:25.680> the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
if I move it up to nine we have on the

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.800 
if I move it up to nine we have on the
other<00:06:25.860> hand<00:06:26.190> a<00:06:26.310> test<00:06:26.550> program<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.360> need<00:06:27.660> to

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
other hand a test program and I need to

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.020 
other hand a test program and I need to
reset<00:06:28.140> the<00:06:28.260> unit<00:06:28.290> and<00:06:28.710> then<00:06:28.860> you'll<00:06:29.010> see<00:06:29.310> as<00:06:29.490> it

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
reset the unit and then you'll see as it

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.390 
reset the unit and then you'll see as it
boots<00:06:30.270> up<00:06:30.480> it's<00:06:30.720> actually<00:06:31.020> gonna<00:06:31.440> move<00:06:32.160> the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
boots up it's actually gonna move the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.600 
boots up it's actually gonna move the
iris<00:06:32.850> forth<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.360> back<00:06:33.600> and<00:06:36.800> just<00:06:37.800> so<00:06:37.980> you<00:06:38.040> can

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
iris forth and back and just so you can

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.460 
iris forth and back and just so you can
see<00:06:38.850> if<00:06:39.030> you<00:06:39.150> connect<00:06:39.510> this<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.900> a<00:06:39.930> lens<00:06:40.230> you

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
see if you connect this to a lens you

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.470 
see if you connect this to a lens you
will<00:06:40.530> see<00:06:40.740> that<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:41.040> lens<00:06:41.220> is

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
will see that the lens is

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.090 
will see that the lens is
moving<00:06:41.720> forth<00:06:41.930> and<00:06:42.110> back<00:06:42.260> and<00:06:42.470> yeah<00:06:42.620> the<00:06:42.890> box

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
moving forth and back and yeah the box

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.790 
moving forth and back and yeah the box
is<00:06:43.250> working<00:06:43.610> then<00:06:43.760> so<00:06:44.480> it<00:06:44.870> will<00:06:45.080> now<00:06:45.230> go<00:06:45.470> in<00:06:45.620> the

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
is working then so it will now go in the

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.450 
is working then so it will now go in the
other<00:06:45.950> direction<00:06:47.260> just<00:06:48.260> shortly<00:06:48.620> so<00:06:49.220> now<00:06:49.370> it

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
other direction just shortly so now it

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.490 
other direction just shortly so now it
moves<00:06:49.700> back<00:06:49.970> again<00:06:50.300> and<00:06:50.510> you<00:06:50.960> also<00:06:51.080> see<00:06:51.350> the

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
moves back again and you also see the

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.350 
moves back again and you also see the
tributary<00:06:52.070> it<00:06:52.190> is<00:06:52.430> blinking<00:06:52.880> so<00:06:53.060> that's<00:06:53.240> the

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
tributary it is blinking so that's the

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.260 
tributary it is blinking so that's the
test<00:06:53.600> mode<00:06:53.810> so<00:06:54.740> basically<00:06:55.160> you<00:06:55.730> select<00:06:55.880> camera

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
test mode so basically you select camera

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.220 
test mode so basically you select camera
zero<00:06:57.080> or<00:06:57.380> sorry<00:06:57.770> one<00:06:58.610> through<00:06:59.360> eight<00:06:59.540> and<00:06:59.810> then

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
zero or sorry one through eight and then

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.500 
zero or sorry one through eight and then
you<00:07:00.350> have<00:07:00.530> a<00:07:00.560> test<00:07:00.950> mode<00:07:01.160> on<00:07:01.460> camera<00:07:02.000> nine<00:07:02.180> and

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
you have a test mode on camera nine and

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.250 
you have a test mode on camera nine and
zero<00:07:02.720> is<00:07:03.170> just<00:07:03.200> neutral<00:07:03.830> you<00:07:04.430> can<00:07:04.700> disable<00:07:05.360> the

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
zero is just neutral you can disable the

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.440 
zero is just neutral you can disable the
iris<00:07:06.740> control<00:07:07.190> with<00:07:07.370> this<00:07:07.520> button<00:07:07.910> if<00:07:08.240> you

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
iris control with this button if you

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.350 
iris control with this button if you
want<00:07:08.660> that<00:07:08.840> for<00:07:09.080> whatever<00:07:09.530> reason<00:07:09.740> and<00:07:10.400> that's

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
want that for whatever reason and that's

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.870 
want that for whatever reason and that's
basically<00:07:11.780> it<00:07:11.960> but<00:07:12.830> we<00:07:13.160> also<00:07:13.340> have<00:07:13.670> an

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
basically it but we also have an

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.410 
basically it but we also have an
extended<00:07:14.450> version<00:07:14.630> of<00:07:15.010> this<00:07:16.010> box<00:07:16.310> and<00:07:16.550> it

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
extended version of this box and it

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.590 
extended version of this box and it
looks<00:07:17.630> like<00:07:17.930> this<00:07:18.940> the<00:07:19.940> only<00:07:20.090> thing<00:07:20.420> that's

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
looks like this the only thing that's

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.010 
looks like this the only thing that's
extended<00:07:21.260> is<00:07:21.440> really<00:07:22.100> the<00:07:22.460> the<00:07:23.270> plug<00:07:23.540> here<00:07:23.840> on

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
extended is really the the plug here on

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.350 
extended is really the the plug here on
the<00:07:24.200> back<00:07:24.350> side<00:07:24.380> because<00:07:25.220> it<00:07:25.400> has<00:07:25.610> additional

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
the back side because it has additional

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.360 
the back side because it has additional
two<00:07:26.810> IO<00:07:27.550> ports<00:07:28.550> so<00:07:29.320> yeah<00:07:30.350> apart<00:07:30.740> from<00:07:30.980> ground

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:31.370 
two IO ports so yeah apart from ground

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.090 
two IO ports so yeah apart from ground
12-volt<00:07:32.120> and<00:07:32.390> the<00:07:32.750> tele<00:07:33.020> output<00:07:33.530> for<00:07:33.770> preview

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
12-volt and the tele output for preview

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.450 
12-volt and the tele output for preview
telly

you<00:07:34.880> also<00:07:35.030> have<00:07:35.360> an<00:07:35.570> input<00:07:36.140> output<00:07:36.320> input

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
you also have an input output input

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.730 
you also have an input output input
output<00:07:37.550> which<00:07:37.790> you<00:07:37.820> could<00:07:38.060> use<00:07:38.110> for<00:07:39.110> either

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 
output which you could use for either

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.010 
output which you could use for either
driving<00:07:40.280> and<00:07:40.640> external<00:07:41.150> or<00:07:41.360> to<00:07:41.540> external

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.020 
driving and external or to external

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.360 
driving and external or to external
lamps<00:07:42.290> here<00:07:42.440> or<00:07:42.620> you<00:07:42.740> could<00:07:42.860> use<00:07:43.040> it<00:07:43.190> for<00:07:43.220> a

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370 
lamps here or you could use it for a

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.010 
lamps here or you could use it for a
push<00:07:43.580> button<00:07:43.820> input<00:07:44.210> that<00:07:44.660> could<00:07:44.900> be

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.020 
push button input that could be

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.180 
push button input that could be
programmed<00:07:45.260> to<00:07:46.630> do<00:07:47.630> a<00:07:47.660> cut<00:07:48.020> select<00:07:48.950> the

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190 
programmed to do a cut select the

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.670 
programmed to do a cut select the
specific<00:07:49.340> input<00:07:49.970> source<00:07:50.210> of<00:07:50.390> whatever<00:07:50.570> so<00:07:51.350> we

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 
specific input source of whatever so we

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.200 
specific input source of whatever so we
thought<00:07:52.040> that<00:07:52.100> it<00:07:52.370> would<00:07:52.400> be<00:07:52.640> nice<00:07:52.820> to

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.210 
thought that it would be nice to

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.420 
thought that it would be nice to
integrate<00:07:53.960> this<00:07:54.230> additional<00:07:54.920> feature<00:07:55.130> now

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.430 
integrate this additional feature now

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.620 
integrate this additional feature now
that<00:07:55.640> we<00:07:55.760> had<00:07:55.880> the<00:07:56.000> box<00:07:56.240> in<00:07:56.390> the<00:07:56.420> whole

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.630 
that we had the box in the whole

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.750 
that we had the box in the whole
communication<00:07:57.140> going<00:07:57.560> so<00:07:58.160> if<00:07:58.490> you<00:07:58.610> have<00:07:58.730> a

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:58.760 
communication going so if you have a

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.840 
communication going so if you have a
need<00:07:58.940> for<00:07:59.090> that<00:07:59.240> our<00:07:59.570> extended<00:08:00.290> 8<00:08:00.860> MB<00:08:01.370> for<00:08:01.580> link

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:01.850 
need for that our extended 8 MB for link

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:07.660 
need for that our extended 8 MB for link
X<00:08:02.230> will<00:08:03.230> provide<00:08:03.590> you<00:08:03.860> with<00:08:04.040> IO<00:08:04.880> as<00:08:05.330> well
