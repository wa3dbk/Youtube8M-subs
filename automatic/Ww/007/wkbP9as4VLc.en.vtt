00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
because in the winter time I get real

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.219 
because in the winter time I get real
pale<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.820> like<00:02:09.030> no<00:02:09.270> color<00:02:09.540> in<00:02:09.720> my<00:02:09.810> face<00:02:09.840> and

pale I have like no color in my face and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.320 
pale I have like no color in my face and
this<00:02:10.650> just<00:02:10.920> makes<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> look<00:02:11.460> like<00:02:11.670> I've<00:02:11.880> been

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
this just makes it look like I've been

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.690 
this just makes it look like I've been
exposed<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:13.020> Sun<00:02:13.260> at<00:02:13.470> least<00:02:13.680> like<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.130> time<00:02:14.460> in

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
exposed to Sun at least like one time in

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.910 
exposed to Sun at least like one time in
my<00:02:14.820> life<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.780> was<00:02:15.960> probably<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.380> bad<00:02:16.410> idea<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
my life this was probably a bad idea to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.450 
my life this was probably a bad idea to
show<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.820> at<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.090> time<00:02:18.120> pop<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
show you this much at one time pop I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.100 
show you this much at one time pop I
just<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> way<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> shares<00:02:21.510> out<00:02:21.840> all

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
just like the way that it shares out all

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.200 
just like the way that it shares out all
over<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.620> skin<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.340> really<00:02:23.550> does<00:02:23.700> Cheryl<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
over the skin it really does Cheryl this

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.000 
over the skin it really does Cheryl this
probably<00:02:24.600> looks<00:02:24.750> super<00:02:25.200> duper<00:02:25.410> pigmented<00:02:25.860> but

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
probably looks super duper pigmented but

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.740 
probably looks super duper pigmented but
once<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.250> put<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.670> over<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.970> face<00:02:27.030> or

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
once you put it all over your face or

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.930 
once you put it all over your face or
even<00:02:27.780> mix<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:28.650> some<00:02:29.190> types<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.580> facial

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
even mix it with some types of a facial

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.730 
even mix it with some types of a facial
moisturizer<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.140> gives<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> really

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
moisturizer it just gives you a really

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.380 
moisturizer it just gives you a really
nice<00:02:31.860> altogether<00:02:32.460> luminous<00:02:32.880> look<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.120> think
