00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.869 

geysers<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:01.020> on<00:00:01.170> in<00:00:01.560> any<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.639> his<00:00:02.730> other

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
geysers going on in any of his other

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.170 
geysers going on in any of his other
bases<00:00:03.480> so<00:00:03.890> we<00:00:04.890> do<00:00:05.069> have<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.370> nexus<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:06.000> down

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
bases so we do have the nexus going down

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.540 
bases so we do have the nexus going down
and<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> expansion<00:00:06.899> right<00:00:07.290> here<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:08.099> look

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
and the expansion right here but look

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.759 
and the expansion right here but look
the<00:00:08.730> creep<00:00:09.059> goes<00:00:09.300> all<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.630> way<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.440> point

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
the creep goes all the way to this point

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.430 
the creep goes all the way to this point
so<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> sir<00:00:11.490> does<00:00:11.849> have<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.150> nice<00:00:12.420> little<00:00:12.660> entry

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so the sir does have a nice little entry

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200 
so the sir does have a nice little entry
point<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:13.920> it'd<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.400> great<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:14.759> he<00:00:15.059> would

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
point here it'd be great if he would

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.630 
point here it'd be great if he would
make<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.570> overlord<00:00:16.109> into<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> seer<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.550> he

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
make this overlord into a seer so he

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.640 
make this overlord into a seer so he
could<00:00:17.789> stop<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.350> stop<00:00:19.529> this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
could stop this so you can stop this

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.109 
could stop this so you can stop this
observer<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:20.279> flying<00:00:20.550> around<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
observer from flying around because I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.090 
observer from flying around because I
think<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.840> show<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.830> great

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
think that that show is in a great

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.429 
think that that show is in a great
position<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
position right now and I see on the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
position right now and I see on the
production<00:00:25.619> tab<00:00:26.099> 42<00:00:26.789> zerglings<00:00:27.420> coming<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.840> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
production tab 42 zerglings coming in so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
production tab 42 zerglings coming in so
that<00:00:28.019> means<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.590> i<00:00:28.859> think<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.490> Zerg<00:00:30.119> players

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that means that i think the Zerg players

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
that means that i think the Zerg players
show<00:00:30.689> ready<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.260> push<00:00:31.769> air<00:00:32.009> he's<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.550> his<00:00:32.640> +1

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
show ready to push air he's got his +1

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.850 
show ready to push air he's got his +1
carapace<00:00:33.510> finished<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> lot<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> certain

carapace finished and a lot of certain
things<00:00:34.920> coming<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.760> problem<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.149> protoss

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
things coming up the problem for protoss

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.440 
things coming up the problem for protoss
is<00:00:36.719> although<00:00:37.020> he<00:00:37.140> has<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> strong<00:00:37.530> economy<00:00:37.739> and

as<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> good<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> concerned<00:01:29.040> losing<00:01:29.579> those

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
as the good is concerned losing those

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
as the good is concerned losing those
Earthlings<00:01:30.030> especially<00:01:30.869> considering<00:01:31.350> how

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
Earthlings especially considering how

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.679 
Earthlings especially considering how
many<00:01:31.530> minerals<00:01:31.890> he's<00:01:32.280> sitting<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.390> no

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
many minerals he's sitting on is like no

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.740 
many minerals he's sitting on is like no
big<00:01:34.020> deal<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.680> his<00:01:35.100> fresh<00:01:35.520> fields<00:01:35.850> from<00:01:36.210> select

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
big deal so his fresh fields from select

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
big deal so his fresh fields from select
were<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.409> hurting<00:01:37.829> his<00:01:38.189> own<00:01:38.400> army<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.060> he

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
were actually hurting his own army as he

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.640 
were actually hurting his own army as he
was<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.509> allowing<00:01:39.810> those<00:01:40.110> Earthlings<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
was just allowing those Earthlings to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
was just allowing those Earthlings to
get<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.700> maximum<00:01:42.150> damage<00:01:42.329> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
get in there and do maximum damage to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510 
get in there and do maximum damage to
all<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> other<00:01:43.530> units<00:01:43.950> around<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.369> there

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
all of the other units around it there

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
all of the other units around it there
so<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.180> actually<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:45.750> lost<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so there was actually a lot lost but you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.139 
so there was actually a lot lost but you
are<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.890> those<00:01:47.189> philosophers<00:01:47.850> are<00:01:47.970> going

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
are right those philosophers are going

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850 
are right those philosophers are going
to<00:01:48.210> turn<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> big<00:01:49.320> deal<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.829> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
to turn out to be a big deal and just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
to turn out to be a big deal and just
massing<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.790> bunch<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> Hydra<00:01:51.899> list<00:01:52.079> may<00:01:52.259> seem

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
massing a bunch of a Hydra list may seem

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
massing a bunch of a Hydra list may seem
like<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> great<00:01:52.920> idea<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.460> trust<00:01:53.759> me<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
like a great idea but trust me they it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.690 
like a great idea but trust me they it
just<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.200> doesn't<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:55.979> work<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.640> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just it just doesn't really work out so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.039 
just it just doesn't really work out so
looking<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> over<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.670> where<00:01:59.670> do<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.810> like

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
looking on over I where do we have like

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
looking on over I where do we have like
a<00:02:01.079> spire<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.560> production<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.579> I've<00:02:02.670> just

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
a spire and production and I've just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
a spire and production and I've just
been<00:02:03.060> bad<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.409> paying<00:02:04.560> attention

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
been bad and not really paying attention

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.580 
been bad and not really paying attention
to<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.219> all<00:02:05.340> don<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.149> army<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:06.960> moving<00:02:07.500> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590

but<00:02:08.409> I<00:02:08.439> don't<00:02:08.709> see<00:02:08.890> aspire<00:02:09.610> for<00:02:09.939> some

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
but I don't see aspire for some

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.970 
but I don't see aspire for some
corrupters<00:02:10.719> so<00:02:11.049> maybe<00:02:11.290> he's<00:02:11.469> just<00:02:11.560> gonna<00:02:11.709> try

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
corrupters so maybe he's just gonna try

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.030 
corrupters so maybe he's just gonna try
to<00:02:12.040> keep<00:02:12.219> up<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.519> link<00:02:12.849> pressure<00:02:13.799> yeah<00:02:14.799> he's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
to keep up this link pressure yeah he's

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.770 
to keep up this link pressure yeah he's
putting<00:02:15.430> down<00:02:15.549> an<00:02:15.670> infestation<00:02:16.209> pit<00:02:16.569> which
