00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello youtube friends today I will talk to you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.960
 of the most powerful weapons in all the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.000
 world in this topic we will see the effects and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.889
 the technology applied in the wrong way 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
 in a compilation of the most weapons 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.260
 lethal good with nothing more to say 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.260
 let's start good first we have metal 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.539
 storm considered the most automatic weapon 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.580
 mighty of the world the metal storm or 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 uses a system that combines the cannon 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.570
 and the bedroom so that the only 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 Moving parts are the same 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.189
 projectiles other automatic weapons 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 they have a bedroom with bullets that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.260
 they are mechanically loaded in the barrel 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.420
 in the goal to the storm however the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 ammunitions are pre-loaded and stacked 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.680
 in a kind of cannon combination or 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 good chamber that gun yes that is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.940
 quite impressive but good 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.700
 let's move on to the next good the next 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.680
 weapon is corner shot 40 combining a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.870
 pivoting bar truck with a sight 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.820
 with video image this called 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 weapon system allows the operator 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
 observe and shoot at a target 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.229
 located in a corner without exposing 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.150
 to enemy fire the cannon can turn 63 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.680
 degrees to the left or to the right and the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.300
 image 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 thermal sight can be transmitted 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.530
 to be combined with other systems of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 detection good that weapon yes that me 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 impressed I want one for when 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.830
 come the zombie apocalypse to follow 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.869
 killing them good xd ya I'm 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 leaving the subject so let's move on to the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.869
 next good weapon the next weapon 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.509
 is barret rifle m 107 barret m 107 is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.479
 the classic sniper rifle 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.000
 used by the army of the us 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.040
 previously known as the m 82 east 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.710
 rifle was employed for the first time in the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.600
 desert storm operation the weapon 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.820
 shoot ammo is very powerful of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 caliber 50 which have been 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.210
 traditionally used for 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.789
 heavy machine guns along the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.289
 time the destruction capacity of 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.360
 This rifle is augmented 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.310
 considerably when combined 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.649
 with explosive bullets 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.869
 well with that weapon I can threaten my 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.810
 teacher to put me 10 in physics 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.899
 x of obvious then let's continue the next 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.729
 weapon is xk 11 the agency for the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.590
 defense development of south korea 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.690
 recently revealed a weapon of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.380
 prototype infantry known as the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.770
 new rifle 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.390
 Korean nr is equipped with a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.760
 laser rangefinder as well as a computer 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.830
 of ballistics this allows the operator 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 to perform precision attacks against 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.780
 the objective the truth I did not understand but 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.970
 let's continue good the next weapon is 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.740
 basic thermos pump with a name 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.140
 derived from the Greek words that 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.990
 they mean heat and pressure these pumps 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.580
 combine the power of both forces 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.880
 greatly expanding its potential to 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.170
 destroy the most inaccessible objectives 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.090
 although the term baricco thermos 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 often used for a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.440
 Wide variety of devices 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.390
 explosives the most accurate is the employee 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.580
 to describe the pumps that combine 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.860
 an explosive mono-propellant fuel 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.050
 with some type of particles extremely 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.140
 fuel and energy with this I can 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.140
 destroy my entire school xd xd xd xd 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.780
 xd ok and then let's continue good the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.030
 next weapon is airborne laser 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.310
 in an initiative that reminds the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.500
 cold war the missile command and the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.450
 American air forces lead to 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.460
 out research and development of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.069
 a weapon with an airborne laser 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.439
 Skillful project involves the assembly of 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.450
 powerful chemical oxygen laser given 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.439
 in a device similar to a tower 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.810
 installed on the nose of a boeing 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.780
 747-400 specially conditioned for 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.909
 it very impressive, let's go to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.060
 the next one that is sensor weapon 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.340
 merged as a highly version 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.709
 improved pump the standard cluster 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.319
 sensor gun formally merged 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.299
 the 97 cv uses small pumps 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.040
 smart to expand its effect 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.989
 destructive through the field of 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.680
 battle with exact hits on 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.659
 multiple enemy targets black duck 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.969
 97 is actually a similar container 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.340
 to an upstairs pump that houses 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.799
 10 cylindrical compartments called 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.989
 submunitions which transport 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.049
 four small smart pumps each 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.689
 a total of 40 pumps are counted 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.669
 smart by gun immediately 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.039
 after the main pump is 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.349
 released its cover opens unfolding 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.630
 the 10 submunitions each with its 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.880
 own parachute at an altitude 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.700
 default the parachutes are 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.980
 discarded is then when the 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.080
 in the jars of submunitions the 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.540
 they lift and spin them to disperse 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.330
 the loading of small pumps 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.130
 finally the infrared sensors 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.170
 located in these track the objectives 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.660
 that are reached by powerful 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.240
 nuclear heads good is that the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.490
 this really left me speechless better 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.980
 let's move on to the next and last weapon that 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.020
 it's good massive ammunition bomb the 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.030
 who have played call of duty will already know 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.210
 what do I mean x the call of duty is a 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.850
 game that if you kill 24 or 25 enemies you 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.950
 give this missile xd and well, this is 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.290
 pump is similar to the thermo bar pump and 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.210
 here is the biggest massive conventional weapon 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.580
 of the American arsenal is the bomb 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.160
 of air blast from massive ammunition that 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.190
 weighs 10.5 tons and contains 9 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.440
 tons of explosives and 6 with 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.350
 similar weight and size 9 meters 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.300
 long and almost 1.5 meters wide this 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.340
 pump can only be thrown from the 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.820
 back door of a spacious airplane 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.130
 load the web uses a gps system to 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.800
 go towards your goal although with 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.660
 a deadly 120- meter burst radius 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.630
 it can not be considered a 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.610
 of kilo precision per kilo this pump is 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.250
 much less effective than others of lower 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.530
 size but its psychological effects that 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.450
 they include an extensive shockwave and 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.890
 a fungus-shaped cloud similar to the 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.130
 of a nuclear bomb are 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.230
 incomparably terrifying this bomb 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.090
 causes serious psychological effects in the 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.010
 enemies since by exploiting this 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.680
 forms a mushroom cloud resembling 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.750
 a nuclear bomb and good friends this 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.550
 it was all I hope and you liked it and if 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.290
 they want to subscribe so that's how 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.840
 find out when you upload to a video 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.840
 good with nothing more to say I say goodbye
