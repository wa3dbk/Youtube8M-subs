00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.230
 it 's not the green of the hand 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.960
 working beelinha the time of my being 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.640
 disassembled because the engine started to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 hit has been taken valve cover take 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.920
 of the car's wiring loops has been 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.019
 disassembled 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 Send me the last part with 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.989
 some parts of fifa can take the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.809
 head will be the block head 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.920
 the bottom of the poster has already been taken 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 also does not cover has not yet prepared 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 How afraid were you that you had 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.190
 happened 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.680
 usually did not care in a alley 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.340
 removing headlights o shock 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.469
 the cable was also taken off the one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.799
 unbearable heat but the mother riding 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.560
 car in order to make the engine here a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.659
 recommendation that I leave the reason 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.680
 What engine started to hit was the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.390
 brand oil filter that vox 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.540
 incentive to never put the car of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.049
 You because that's what's going to end. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.470
 happening they assemble to make the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.310
 motor what happened the filter caught 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 not letting oil flow inside the engine 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 burst to the dm retainer and leaked three 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.829
 liters of oil and started hit the engine 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.630
 name only in orbit of crank and board 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.880
 I do not even know how to play . 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 crank piston rings because it is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.310
 software had no lubrication 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.090
 all due to the filter of the mark ox 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.659
 so never use in your car 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.140
 the filter of this mark 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.530
 That's it, people, then it's there. 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.420
 If the car is equipped with a 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.220
 fox brand oil 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.120
 real x switch urgently before this 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.739
 happen 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 less than one month to change oil 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.480
 car was voted son of the brand fox and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.930
 he fought this the return 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.450
 this is the first case of this filter is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.450
 then the recommendation of some mechanics 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:37.079
 and mine also for your experience this 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.079
 do not use that's it guys stay there
