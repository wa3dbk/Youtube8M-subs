00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
are downsides to this this is why it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.290 
are downsides to this this is why it's
in<00:00:46.649> number<00:00:46.890> five<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.960> because<00:00:49.370> when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
in number five is because when you go to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.139 
in number five is because when you go to
open<00:00:51.750> your<00:00:52.050> areas<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.860> may<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
open your areas there may not be the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
totem pole that is to activate in that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
totem pole that is to activate in that
area<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> will<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> find<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.180> doors

the six power stones or the six
generators<00:01:45.240> around<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> map<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.920> usually

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
generators around the map and it usually

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
generators around the map and it usually
takes<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.970> less<00:01:48.570> than<00:01:48.630> round<00:01:49.020> 10<00:01:49.259> depending

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
takes you less than round 10 depending

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.789 
takes you less than round 10 depending
on<00:01:49.860> how<00:01:50.100> quick<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:51.869> in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
on how quick you can do it because in

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.050 
on how quick you can do it because in
co-op<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.549> generators<00:01:54.710> cost<00:01:55.710> 200<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.820> than

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
co-op the generators cost 200 more than

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.929 
co-op the generators cost 200 more than
they<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.680> solo<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> yeah<00:02:00.890> pretty<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.009> it's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
they do in solo so yeah pretty much it's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.990

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
picked to a call of the day is because

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.900 
picked to a call of the day is because
you<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.959> one<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.290> three<00:03:53.500> chance<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.370> the
