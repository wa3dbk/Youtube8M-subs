00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
on December 20th of 2010 we were able to

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.930 
on December 20th of 2010 we were able to
see<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> total<00:00:04.020> eclipse<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.620> moon<00:00:04.890> now<00:00:05.879> I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
see a total eclipse of the moon now I

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.080 
see a total eclipse of the moon now I
love<00:00:06.210> both<00:00:06.420> photography<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.529> astronomy<00:00:08.400> so

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
love both photography and astronomy so

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.350 
love both photography and astronomy so
of<00:00:09.179> course<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.480> had<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.750> get<00:00:09.929> photos<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.410> this

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
of course I had to get photos of this

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.209 
of course I had to get photos of this
now<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> moon<00:00:12.900> doesn't<00:00:13.410> cover<00:00:13.590> much<00:00:13.799> face<00:00:14.040> in

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
now the moon doesn't cover much face in

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.580 
now the moon doesn't cover much face in
the<00:00:14.309> sky<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.969> surprisingly<00:00:15.900> small<00:00:16.020> amount

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the sky it's a surprisingly small amount

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.000 
the sky it's a surprisingly small amount
and<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.310> only<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.730> half<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> degree<00:00:18.859> if<00:00:19.859> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
and it's only about half a degree if you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.529 
and it's only about half a degree if you
hold<00:00:20.189> your<00:00:20.250> pinky<00:00:20.490> finger<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.330> arm's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
hold your pinky finger out at arm's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.109 
hold your pinky finger out at arm's
length<00:00:22.220> that<00:00:23.220> covers<00:00:23.430> more<00:00:23.760> than<00:00:23.939> half<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
length that covers more than half a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
length that covers more than half a
degree<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.019> cover<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> moon<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.010> your

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
degree it can cover the moon with your

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.609 
degree it can cover the moon with your
pinky<00:00:26.400> finger<00:00:26.430> how<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.060> arms<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.619> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
pinky finger how that arms like so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.640 
pinky finger how that arms like so
that's<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.010> very<00:00:29.160> big<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.470> want

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that's not very big so if you want

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.190 
that's not very big so if you want
details<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.669> moon<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> photo<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.989> need

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
details of the moon in a photo you need

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.580 
details of the moon in a photo you need
the<00:00:34.950> tightest<00:00:35.399> field<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.790> view<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.300> get

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
the tightest field of view you can get

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.360 
the tightest field of view you can get
now<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.890> me<00:00:38.059> that<00:00:39.059> means<00:00:39.270> using<00:00:39.950> this<00:00:40.950> Canon

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
now for me that means using this Canon

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.400 
now for me that means using this Canon
70<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> 200<00:00:42.660> lens<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.860> 200<00:00:44.280> millimeters<00:00:45.410> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
70 to 200 lens out at 200 millimeters it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100 
70 to 200 lens out at 200 millimeters it
means<00:00:46.620> using<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.489> Canon<00:00:47.910> 40d<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.930> has<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
means using this Canon 40d which has a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
means using this Canon 40d which has a
1.6<00:00:49.620> crop<00:00:50.010> factor<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.649> using<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:53.059> 1.4<00:00:54.059> times

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
1.6 crop factor and using this 1.4 times

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.660 
1.6 crop factor and using this 1.4 times
extender<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.770> again<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
extender so again this is just the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
extender so again this is just the
equipment<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:58.079> an<00:00:58.199> 800

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
equipment I have if you have like an 800

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
equipment I have if you have like an 800
millimeter<00:00:59.010> lens<00:00:59.250> you're<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.879> do

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
millimeter lens you're going to do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.250 
millimeter lens you're going to do
better<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.550> equipment

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
better so with this equipment

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.000 
better so with this equipment
if<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.680> moon<00:01:05.309> looks<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
if the moon looks like this so as you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.539 
if the moon looks like this so as you
can<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.760> some<00:01:08.939> nice<00:01:09.090> detail<00:01:10.549> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
can see you can get some nice detail and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.180 
can see you can get some nice detail and
it<00:01:11.760> covers<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> decent<00:01:12.479> amount<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> frame

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.640 

now<00:01:17.190> being<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.640> level<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> astronomy<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:19.380> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
now being a level of astronomy I of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.700 
now being a level of astronomy I of
course<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> telescope<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> let's<00:01:22.560> see

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
course have a telescope and so let's see

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
course have a telescope and so let's see
how<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> use<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.930> help<00:01:25.080> us<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
how we can use this to help us take a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.580 
how we can use this to help us take a
shot<00:01:25.800> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> moon<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> celestron

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
shot of the moon this is a celestron

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.430 
shot of the moon this is a celestron
next<00:01:29.220> star<00:01:29.370> for<00:01:29.840> maksakov<00:01:30.840> Cassegrain

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
next star for maksakov Cassegrain

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.280 
next star for maksakov Cassegrain
telescope<00:01:31.790> now<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.330> small<00:01:33.750> but

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
telescope now it's really small but

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.400 
telescope now it's really small but
that's<00:01:35.040> because<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.670> uses<00:01:35.850> mirrors<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
that's because it uses mirrors now the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.430 
that's because it uses mirrors now the
front<00:01:37.710> element<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.960> light<00:01:39.960> comes<00:01:40.260> in

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
front element here light comes in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.860 
front element here light comes in
there's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> mirror<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.790> back<00:01:41.910> shaped<00:01:42.720> like

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
there's a mirror at the back shaped like

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.790 
there's a mirror at the back shaped like
a<00:01:42.900> bowl<00:01:43.550> which<00:01:44.840> focuses<00:01:45.840> light<00:01:46.080> back<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
a bowl which focuses light back to the

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.100 
a bowl which focuses light back to the
front<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:47.580> there's<00:01:47.730> a<00:01:47.820> small<00:01:48.150> mirror<00:01:48.450> which

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
front where there's a small mirror which

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
front where there's a small mirror which
bounces<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.650> light<00:01:49.800> back<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.060> back<00:01:51.270> or

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
bounces the light back to the back or

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
bounces the light back to the back or
there's<00:01:52.080> another<00:01:52.350> mirror<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.770> reflects<00:01:53.160> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there's another mirror that reflects it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.440 
there's another mirror that reflects it
up<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.300> this<00:01:54.720> eyepiece<00:01:56.090> place<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:59.190> that's<00:01:59.450> we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
up to this eyepiece place and that's we

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.010 
up to this eyepiece place and that's we
can<00:02:00.630> look<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.960> whatever<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.350> want<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.980> sky

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
can look at whatever we want in the sky

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.710 
can look at whatever we want in the sky
now<00:02:04.310> how<00:02:05.310> do<00:02:05.370> we<00:02:05.490> take<00:02:05.730> in<00:02:05.970> in<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.210> case<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
now how do we take in in this case this

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.580 
now how do we take in in this case this
is<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.990> 5d<00:02:07.380> mark<00:02:07.590> ii<00:02:08.330> ivory<00:02:09.330> take<00:02:09.570> this<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
is a 5d mark ii ivory take this to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
is a 5d mark ii ivory take this to
connect<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:12.500> fortunately<00:02:13.500> it's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
connect it to there fortunately it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.690 
connect it to there fortunately it's
easy<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:16.290> that's<00:02:17.010> using<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:19.350> is

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
easy and that's using this this is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
easy and that's using this this is
something<00:02:20.700> from<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.940> company<00:02:21.239> called<00:02:21.270> scope

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
something from a company called scope

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.610 
something from a company called scope
Tronics<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.610> camera<00:02:24.209> adapter<00:02:24.620> for

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
Tronics it is a camera adapter for

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.370 
Tronics it is a camera adapter for
telescope<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.700> has<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.209> 1<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.540> 1/8<00:02:27.780> inch<00:02:28.020> flange

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
telescope it has a 1 and 1/8 inch flange

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.370 
telescope it has a 1 and 1/8 inch flange
for<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> eyepiece<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.570> length<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.170> end

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
for the eyepiece on the length one end

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.920 
for the eyepiece on the length one end
and<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> has<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> Canon<00:02:33.000> bayonet<00:02:33.420> mat<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and it has a Canon bayonet mat on the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.160 
and it has a Canon bayonet mat on the
other<00:02:34.110> now<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.130> cost<00:02:35.370> about<00:02:35.970> 90<00:02:36.510> US<00:02:36.720> dollars

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
other now this cost about 90 US dollars

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.860 
other now this cost about 90 US dollars
so<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.590> too<00:02:37.770> bad<00:02:38.150> even<00:02:39.150> though<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.690> piece

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so not too bad even though it's a piece

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.979 
so not too bad even though it's a piece
of<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.350> well<00:02:40.800> machined<00:02:41.310> aluminum<00:02:41.989> so

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
of really well machined aluminum so

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.740 
of really well machined aluminum so
that's<00:02:43.350> really<00:02:43.560> nice<00:02:43.830> well<00:02:44.760> what<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.570> is

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
that's really nice well what you do is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.020 
that's really nice well what you do is
you<00:02:45.900> mount<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> bayonet<00:02:46.560> mount<00:02:46.910> onto<00:02:47.910> your

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
you mount the bayonet mount onto your

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.900 
you mount the bayonet mount onto your
camera<00:02:50.480> like<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.550> just<00:02:53.580> mount

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
camera like that then you just mount

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.680 
camera like that then you just mount
that<00:02:54.150> into<00:02:54.450> your<00:02:54.600> telescope

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.300 

and<00:03:01.380> now<00:03:01.500> you're<00:03:01.740> ready<00:03:01.890> for

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and now you're ready for

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.220 
and now you're ready for
astrophotography<00:03:03.800> now<00:03:04.800> with<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.190> setup<00:03:05.460> and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
astrophotography now with this setup and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
astrophotography now with this setup and
remember<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> 5d<00:03:07.650> mark<00:03:07.830> ii<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> full-frame

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
remember the 5d mark ii is a full-frame

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.560 
remember the 5d mark ii is a full-frame
full<00:03:09.420> 35<00:03:09.870> millimeter<00:03:10.290> sensor<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.300> so<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.450> is

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
full 35 millimeter sensor and so this is

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.970 
full 35 millimeter sensor and so this is
what<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.840> moon<00:03:13.020> looks<00:03:13.050> like<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.700> setup

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
what the moon looks like with this setup

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.300 
what the moon looks like with this setup
as<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.280> see<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:19.020> moon<00:03:19.260> feels<00:03:19.680> much<00:03:20.010> more

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
as you can see the moon feels much more

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.890 
as you can see the moon feels much more
of<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.490> frame<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.090> setup<00:03:21.330> even<00:03:21.630> though

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
of the frame with this setup even though

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.420 
of the frame with this setup even though
this<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.290> full-frame<00:03:22.740> sensor

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
this is a full-frame sensor

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.450 
this is a full-frame sensor
it's<00:03:24.120> almost<00:03:24.650> filling<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.740> frame<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
it's almost filling the frame with the

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.090 
it's almost filling the frame with the
move<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.570> we're<00:03:27.750> getting<00:03:27.930> lots<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.440> detail

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
move so we're getting lots of detail

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.700 
move so we're getting lots of detail
this<00:03:29.970> telescope<00:03:30.360> also<00:03:30.840> includes<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.320> tracking

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
this telescope also includes a tracking

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.200 
this telescope also includes a tracking
mechanism<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.490> other<00:03:32.700> words<00:03:32.880> there's<00:03:33.150> a

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
mechanism in other words there's a

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.900 
mechanism in other words there's a
horizontal<00:03:33.510> motor<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.230> base<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.910> a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
horizontal motor in the base and a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.870 
horizontal motor in the base and a
vertical<00:03:36.480> motor<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.860> control<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.280> azimuth<00:03:38.700> in

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
vertical motor to control the azimuth in

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.750 
vertical motor to control the azimuth in
the<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.620> side<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.070> telescope<00:03:41.520> tube

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the on the side of the telescope tube

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.140 
the on the side of the telescope tube
and<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.540> has<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> tracking<00:03:43.260> controller<00:03:44.150> now

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and it has a tracking controller now

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.880 
and it has a tracking controller now
this<00:03:45.420> isn't<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.810> expensive<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.380> telescope

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
this isn't that expensive the telescope

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.770 
this isn't that expensive the telescope
and<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.640> tracking<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.270> little<00:03:48.630> bit

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
and so the tracking is a little bit

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.450 
and so the tracking is a little bit
dodgy<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:50.540> even<00:03:51.540> when<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.780> set<00:03:51.990> this<00:03:52.140> up

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
dodgy it even when you set this up

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.770 
dodgy it even when you set this up
objects<00:03:53.460> tend<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.790> drift<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.180> bit<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.750> I

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
objects tend to drift a little bit so I

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.650 
objects tend to drift a little bit so I
normally<00:03:55.200> don't<00:03:55.320> set<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.620> up<00:03:56.210> now<00:03:57.210> one<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
normally don't set it up now one of the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.390 
normally don't set it up now one of the
nice<00:03:57.840> things<00:03:57.870> about<00:03:58.230> using<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.740> telescope<00:03:59.040> like

then<00:06:42.660> using<00:06:42.930> the<00:06:43.020> 40<00:06:43.320> D<00:06:43.970> because<00:06:44.970> all<00:06:45.300> my<00:06:46.200> 40<00:06:46.470> DS

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
then using the 40 D because all my 40 DS

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.630 
then using the 40 D because all my 40 DS
doing<00:06:46.980> is<00:06:47.100> reducing<00:06:47.670> the<00:06:47.970> field<00:06:48.210> of<00:06:48.390> view<00:06:48.540> so

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
doing is reducing the field of view so

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.460 
doing is reducing the field of view so
of<00:06:50.640> course<00:06:50.820> people<00:06:51.480> say<00:06:51.600> megapixels<00:06:52.260> don't

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
of course people say megapixels don't

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.310 
of course people say megapixels don't
matter<00:06:53.180> yeah

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.660 

so<00:06:58.320> that's<00:06:58.500> how<00:06:58.650> I<00:06:58.680> set<00:06:58.950> up<00:06:58.980> my<00:06:59.070> shout<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.580> the

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
so that's how I set up my shout to the

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.300 
so that's how I set up my shout to the
moon<00:06:59.850> and<00:07:00.060> I<00:07:00.930> hope<00:07:01.140> that<00:07:01.320> helps<00:07:01.620> this<00:07:01.890> setup

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
moon and I hope that helps this setup

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.210 
moon and I hope that helps this setup
works<00:07:02.550> with<00:07:03.090> any<00:07:03.510> telescope<00:07:04.110> that<00:07:04.590> has<00:07:04.650> a<00:07:04.830> 1<00:07:05.190> in

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
works with any telescope that has a 1 in

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.120 
works with any telescope that has a 1 in
1/8<00:07:05.700> inch<00:07:06.440> eyepiece<00:07:07.440> and<00:07:07.710> so<00:07:08.370> give<00:07:08.730> it<00:07:08.760> a<00:07:08.880> try
