why<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:00.989> designed<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.590> way<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:03.149> find

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
why that's designed this way so we find

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
why that's designed this way so we find
where<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> space<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> joy<00:01:04.860> touch<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
where the space is for the joy touch it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.170 
where the space is for the joy touch it
with<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.640> finger<00:01:05.869> other<00:01:06.869> side<00:01:08.119> flatten<00:01:09.119> a

this<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> caper<00:01:50.580> joint<00:01:50.910> that's<00:01:51.090> why<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
this is the caper joint that's why you

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.700 
this is the caper joint that's why you
see<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.660> lunar<00:01:51.870> month<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> course<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that was part of the joint we'll be

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.630 
that was part of the joint we'll be
treating<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.510> just<00:01:57.870> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.200> differently

triangle this is the method or that I'm

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.290 
triangle this is the method or that I'm
going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.030> use<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.390> apply<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.780> mud<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.410> perform

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
going to use to apply the mud to perform

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
going to use to apply the mud to perform
so<00:04:13.740> let's<00:04:14.740> load<00:04:14.920> up<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.250> corner<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:16.290> got<00:04:17.290> a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
so let's load up the corner I got a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.410 
so let's load up the corner I got a
little<00:04:17.560> triangle<00:04:17.920> deal<00:04:18.190> work<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:18.730> would<00:04:18.910> go

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
little triangle deal work and I would go

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.060 
little triangle deal work and I would go
past<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.930> joint<00:04:20.200> by<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.410> little<00:04:20.739> bit<00:04:20.860> actually

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
past the joint by a little bit actually

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.010 
past the joint by a little bit actually

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
trying to do this time pick it up

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.460 
trying to do this time pick it up
properly<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:03.070> lay<00:05:03.370> down<00:05:03.400> too<00:05:04.000> much<00:05:04.150> wide<00:05:04.470> strip

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.860 
properly to lay down too much wide strip
of<00:05:05.650> mine<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.910> did<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:07.240> pattern<00:05:07.630> so<00:05:07.780> I'm

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
of mine and I did this pattern so I'm

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.450 
of mine and I did this pattern so I'm
gonna<00:05:07.990> take<00:05:08.140> one<00:05:08.200> extra<00:05:08.560> step<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.950> wipe<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
gonna take one extra step of wipe the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.210 
gonna take one extra step of wipe the
ancestry<00:05:10.060> now<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:13.030> I'll<00:05:13.180> tell<00:05:13.390> the<00:05:13.600> tale

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
ancestry now and I'll tell the tale

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.710 
ancestry now and I'll tell the tale
where<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.640> hold<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.000> tape<00:05:15.210> comes<00:05:15.480> into

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
where the hold the tape comes into

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.720 
where the hold the tape comes into
effect<00:05:17.600> there's<00:05:18.600> an<00:05:18.750> inside<00:05:19.080> crease<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.860> a

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
effect there's an inside crease and a

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.730 
effect there's an inside crease and a
pointy<00:05:21.150> side<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.540> pointy<00:05:21.840> side<00:05:21.870> goes<00:05:22.320> towards

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
pointy side the pointy side goes towards

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.680 
pointy side the pointy side goes towards
the<00:05:22.830> corner<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.310> inside<00:05:23.640> crease<00:05:23.940> allows<00:05:24.450> me

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
the corner the inside crease allows me

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.800 
the corner the inside crease allows me
to<00:05:24.780> pull<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.640> run<00:05:26.640> up<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:28.040> very<00:05:29.040> very<00:05:29.370> easily

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
to pull and run up it very very easily

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.510 
to pull and run up it very very easily
so<00:05:30.810> this<00:05:31.170> clip<00:05:31.440> put<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> place<00:05:31.890> into<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.220> corner

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
so this clip put a place into the corner

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.850 
so this clip put a place into the corner
it's<00:05:32.610> already<00:05:32.850> cooled<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.150> ready<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.390> go

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
it's already cooled and ready to go

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.070 
it's already cooled and ready to go
place<00:05:34.860> at<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.130> top<00:05:35.340> work<00:05:35.850> your<00:05:36.060> way<00:05:36.180> down<00:05:39.080> and

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
place at the top work your way down and

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.400 
place at the top work your way down and
two<00:05:40.860> sides<00:05:41.100> at<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.310> same<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:42.020> now<00:05:43.020> pick<00:05:43.290> up

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
two sides at the same time now pick up

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.700 
two sides at the same time now pick up
my<00:05:43.560> tools<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.390> this<00:05:45.390> is<00:05:45.630> lightning<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.440> fit

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
my tools and this is lightning that fit

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.530 
my tools and this is lightning that fit
so<00:05:47.370> we're<00:05:47.490> going<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.640> took<00:05:47.850> that<00:05:48.030> knife<00:05:48.240> up

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
so we're going to took that knife up

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.510 
so we're going to took that knife up
we're<00:05:49.080> going<00:05:49.230> to<00:05:49.350> wait<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.740> tape<00:05:49.920> but<00:05:50.130> not<00:05:50.310> up

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
we're going to wait the tape but not up

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.220 
we're going to wait the tape but not up
and<00:05:50.760> push<00:05:50.940> to<00:05:51.180> our<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.600> you're<00:05:51.720> taking<00:05:52.140> the

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
and push to our that you're taking the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.800 
and push to our that you're taking the
money<00:05:52.380> from<00:05:52.620> behind<00:05:52.860> it<00:05:53.100> so<00:05:53.310> we<00:05:53.550> go<00:05:54.240> a<00:05:54.510> little

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
money from behind it so we go a little

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.660 
money from behind it so we go a little
bit<00:05:55.020> at<00:05:55.140> a<00:05:55.230> time<00:05:55.320> step<00:05:55.980> from<00:05:56.190> center<00:05:56.550> of<00:05:56.580> the

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
bit at a time step from center of the

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.740 
bit at a time step from center of the
tape<00:05:56.910> choke<00:05:57.780> up<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.260> push<00:05:58.530> up<00:05:59.240> to<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.270> center

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
tape choke up and push up to the center

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.480 
tape choke up and push up to the center
to<00:06:00.900> tilt<00:06:01.110> down

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
to tilt down

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.490 
to tilt down
we'll<00:06:02.490> run<00:06:02.760> from<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.180> bottom<00:06:03.570> all<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.810> way<00:06:04.350> to

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
we'll run from the bottom all the way to

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.740 
we'll run from the bottom all the way to
the<00:06:04.710> top<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.250> that's<00:06:05.730> nice<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.300> flat<00:06:06.510> and
