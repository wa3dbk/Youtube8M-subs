00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.159 

what's<00:00:08.069> up<00:00:08.339> everyone<00:00:08.579> I'm<00:00:08.700> supernova<00:00:09.329> and<00:00:09.690> I'm

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:10.169 
what's up everyone I'm supernova and I'm

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.379 
what's up everyone I'm supernova and I'm
here<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.769> demonstrate<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.519> performance<00:00:12.209> of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
here to demonstrate the performance of

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.730 
here to demonstrate the performance of
the<00:00:12.659> GTX<00:00:13.230> 645<00:00:13.820> running<00:00:14.820> ARMA<00:00:15.419> 3<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:16.500> if

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the GTX 645 running ARMA 3 now if

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
the GTX 645 running ARMA 3 now if
there's<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> relatively<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.519> game<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.150> that's

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
there's a relatively new game so that's

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.769 
there's a relatively new game so that's
why<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> wanted<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> try<00:00:19.349> we'll<00:00:19.980> test<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> out

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
why I wanted to try we'll test it out

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.650 
why I wanted to try we'll test it out
because<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.429> lot<00:00:23.429> of<00:00:23.730> people<00:00:23.939> consider<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> GTX

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
because a lot of people consider a GTX

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
because a lot of people consider a GTX
645<00:00:25.169> a<00:00:25.199> pretty<00:00:25.859> low-end<00:00:26.099> graph<00:00:26.640> Scott<00:00:26.849> what

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
645 a pretty low-end graph Scott what

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
645 a pretty low-end graph Scott what
yes<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.929> much<00:00:28.230> better<00:00:28.439> graphics

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
yes it is there is much better graphics

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.540 
yes it is there is much better graphics
card<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.310> than<00:00:29.689> 65<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.499> and<00:00:32.220> just

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
card you can get than 65 but and just

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.550 
card you can get than 65 but and just
keep<00:00:32.760> in<00:00:33.030> mind<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> 645<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> very

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
keep in mind that the 645 is very

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.770 
keep in mind that the 645 is very
similar<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> 615<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:36.150> is<00:00:36.300> only<00:00:36.480> five

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
similar to the 615 it is only five

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.420 
similar to the 615 it is only five
numbers<00:00:37.080> off<00:00:37.230> which<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.490> why<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:40.170> know

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
numbers off which is why but you know

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
numbers off which is why but you know
because<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.550> don't<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.060> sell<00:00:42.240> the<00:00:42.360> 645

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
because I don't think they sell the 645

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
because I don't think they sell the 645
individually<00:00:43.380> anymore<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:44.130> I'm<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.490> saying

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
individually anymore so I'm just saying

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.370 
individually anymore so I'm just saying
that<00:00:44.760> right<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:45.050> now<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.170> you're<00:00:46.320> watching

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
that right now now if you're watching

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.930 
that right now now if you're watching
this<00:00:46.620> you're<00:00:46.800> probably<00:00:46.830> watching<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
this you're probably watching this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.050 
this you're probably watching this
because<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:49.650> GTX<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> perhaps<00:00:50.310> in<00:00:50.790> the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
because the GTX is perhaps in the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.480 
because the GTX is perhaps in the
Alienware<00:00:51.420> x51

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
Alienware x51

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.680 
Alienware x51
desktop<00:00:53.490> PC<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.950> it's<00:00:56.580> also<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:57.300> that's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
desktop PC so and it's also the that's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.350 
desktop PC so and it's also the that's
not<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> PC<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.440> beside<00:00:59.160> PC<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.970> I<00:01:00.000> have

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
not the PC I have beside PC that I have

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.470 
not the PC I have beside PC that I have
is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.900> Dell<00:01:01.080> XPS<00:01:01.250> 8700<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:02.880> it's<00:01:03.180> pretty

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
is the Dell XPS 8700 now it's pretty

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
is the Dell XPS 8700 now it's pretty
similar<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.960> x51<00:01:04.350> other<00:01:04.680> than<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
similar to the x51 other than the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.220 
similar to the x51 other than the
processor<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.090> much<00:01:06.330> better<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.080> not

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
processor is much better and it's not

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.080 
processor is much better and it's not
that<00:01:07.410> much<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:07.800> expensive<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.550> really

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that much more expensive so I really

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.140 
that much more expensive so I really
recommend<00:01:09.210> buying<00:01:09.690> this<00:01:10.020> over<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> x51

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
recommend buying this over the x51

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
recommend buying this over the x51
because<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> x51<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.100> cheapest<00:01:14.940> one

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because I know the x51 the cheapest one

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020 
because I know the x51 the cheapest one
I<00:01:15.120> think<00:01:15.300> is<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.600> $700<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.770> has<00:01:17.010> like<00:01:17.340> an

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I think is like $700 and it has like an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
I think is like $700 and it has like an
i3<00:01:18.690> processor<00:01:19.290> versus<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.670> it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
i3 processor versus this I think it's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.110 
i3 processor versus this I think it's
like<00:01:20.970> maybe<00:01:21.870> 800<00:01:22.440> not<00:01:22.980> sure<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.490> guess<00:01:23.850> how<00:01:23.970> much

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
like maybe 800 not sure I guess how much

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.320 
like maybe 800 not sure I guess how much
it<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.380> has<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.620> i7<00:01:25.980> processor<00:01:26.640> much

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it was and it has an i7 processor much

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.469 
it was and it has an i7 processor much
much<00:01:27.690> better<00:01:27.870> so<00:01:29.120> it's<00:01:30.120> got<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.330> same

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
much better so it's got the same

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.710 
much better so it's got the same
graphics<00:01:30.780> card<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> GTX<00:01:31.530> 645<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.210> yeah<00:01:33.360> let's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
graphics card the GTX 645 so yeah let's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
graphics card the GTX 645 so yeah let's
just<00:01:33.870> jump<00:01:34.260> right<00:01:34.350> into<00:01:34.620> gameplay<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.520> will

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
just jump right into gameplay I will

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.320 
just jump right into gameplay I will
leave<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.620> spec<00:01:37.620> specs<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.760> PC<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.300> the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
leave my spec specs for my PC in the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.880 
leave my spec specs for my PC in the
description<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.560> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> know

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
there's a pretty relatively new game so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
there's a pretty relatively new game so
if<00:01:46.860> you're<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.700> card<00:01:48.120> will<00:01:48.390> run

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
if you're one see how this card will run

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.770 
if you're one see how this card will run
newer<00:01:49.409> games<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.270> came<00:01:51.600> out

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
newer games that are that have came out

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.370 
newer games that are that have came out
recently

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
recently

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.490 
recently
well<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.460> card<00:01:53.729> well<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
well this card well this well this is a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.660 
well this card well this well this is a
demonstration<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
demonstration of that

with the gameplay movin it is pretty
good<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.220> I'm<00:02:06.280> not<00:02:06.400> sure<00:02:06.610> exactly<00:02:07.509> how<00:02:07.810> many

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900

actually didn't look that bad and if you
put<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.060> on<00:05:39.240> blower<00:05:39.479> settings<00:05:39.840> maybe<00:05:40.050> like

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
put it on blower settings maybe like
