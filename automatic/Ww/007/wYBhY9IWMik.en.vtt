00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.350
 I know quite well the question why on 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.920
 because it is at the bottom rendered by na'vi at the bottom 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.200
 well, there is even more bad 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.279
 damn I said already answered it just 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.180
 installed did not catch that moment 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.180
 when some teams 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.300
 competing with each other and yourself 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.080
 price with each other with the same navi themselves 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.340
 with them they stretched to the level of ana ve 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.340
 ana ve remained where they were gone 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.940
 no new strategies no new people 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.379
 new nothing from us how to play 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:56.030
 also the same as last average all 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.250
 time but only all the teams could and 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.570
 tune out to this and leave already 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.879
 forward in some moments very far 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.060
 navi remained at the same level 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.830
 there get drunk convulsively clings to just 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.140
 all possible strategies of all teams 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.880
 around who use that is from him 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.299
 can see almost exact under 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.640
 carbon paper piquus liquid and fnatikov and everything is well 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.869
 how not to be so bad. you cop 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.619
 but the ax and how about the same I 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.240
 say that he copied there peak even 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.650
 if you are so count 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.479
 limited number of heroes which 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.869
 peaks further limit in practice 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.729
 at 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.470
 the problem is repeated in another problem 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.650
 the fact that every one of those teams which 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.619
 Now give on hat and navi and there 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.920
 competing with each other tang 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.329
 virtus.pro and empire liquid on the div tag and 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 others they each know about themselves perfectly 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.270
 and all I know how to what some heroes 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 peaks and u how well they can 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.890
 she's not playing about herself now 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.619
 they know themselves they do not know what peaks they 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.549
 have to play they try to peak everything and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.799
 tail on the boiler saw well tada you see 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.480
 posts to 31 shooting range on ikse in mid and so 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.459
 further because they do not know what you 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.830
 since you just need to train to start 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.110
 together to play in a game played 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.820
 week on sucks internal 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.100
 kah one other third started 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.690
 win the fourth and you will understand here 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.730
 4 here are these heroes 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.860
 well, everything and your own will continue 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.930
 ok and I donâ€™t train at all 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.190
 and well actually i wo n't appear 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.340
 must happen so they started 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.060
 break if they lose there on t57 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.500
 games out of 10 while half there is not sound 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.750
 and not the strongest teams 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.110
 sorry there is no offense pl but still i 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.730
 I think the Persians did not expect to win there 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.000
 the same Mouzon rox.kis almost lost 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.950
 today were very close indeed 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.300
 Well, how would u if they do not 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.760
 enough to start 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.820
 train I don't know access well how 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.959
 conditionally happens with therefore losing 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.630
 which will begin 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.930
 spend your childhood well how would they still 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.810
 there will be a title of strength 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.910
 they at least stop looking 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.770
 bad in games if they continue to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.959
 lose it will mean completely 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.239
 other things that mean just 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.739
 overall level no matter how you go 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.350
 maybe some single command 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.930
 which is simply the best and simply 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.970
 because there is no and they have a better skill 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.739
 now a lot of people are caught up I'm sure 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.200
 that on sight even for an hour they already go 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.670
 We will not be looking down and rip all 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.250
 also as sawdust as was in 2011 yes yes but 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.470
 at least they will be back again top will 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.720
 all the time there will be teams that 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.090
 on the turn are afraid to play with 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.400
 always unpleasant with that how would you 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.570
 always fear from which it is necessary 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.780
 try one hundred percent 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.310
 now of course navi are far from that 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.310
 but actually
