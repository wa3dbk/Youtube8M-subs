to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.640> way<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> could<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to be the only way you could get you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
to be the only way you could get you
could<00:01:48.479> resolve<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> hyper<00:01:49.229> Genesis<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
could resolve the hyper Genesis was to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
could resolve the hyper Genesis was to
suspend<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> let<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.880> tick<00:01:51.149> down<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.750> then

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
suspend it let it tick down and then

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389 
suspend it let it tick down and then
