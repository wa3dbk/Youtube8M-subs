are for the SLR the l1a1 to demonstrate

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.340 
are for the SLR the l1a1 to demonstrate
how<00:00:22.320> our<00:00:22.800> current<00:00:23.340> range<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.880> DX<00:00:24.150> strip<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
how our current range of DX strip and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980 
how our current range of DX strip and
how<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> working<00:00:26.340> parts<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:27.300> available<00:00:27.359> for

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
how the working parts are available for

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.940 
how the working parts are available for
you<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:30.150> cock<00:00:30.980> dry<00:00:31.980> fire<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> weapon<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
you to to cock dry fire the weapon and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.270 
you to to cock dry fire the weapon and
and<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:36.719> basically<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.710> much<00:00:37.890> better<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and and basically how much better that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.229 
and and basically how much better that
is<00:00:38.430> than<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.820> current<00:00:39.690> spec<00:00:40.100> deactivations

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
is than the current spec deactivations

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.229 
is than the current spec deactivations
and<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.750> here's<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> rifle<00:00:44.239> I'm

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and so first of all here's the rifle I'm

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.040 
and so first of all here's the rifle I'm
sure<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:46.460> 1970s<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.550> 80s<00:00:48.050> squaddies

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
sure you're all 1970s and 80s squaddies

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.040 
sure you're all 1970s and 80s squaddies
will<00:00:49.200> recognize<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.629> will<00:00:51.629> take<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
will recognize it will take up the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.139 
will recognize it will take up the
magazine<00:00:52.440> magazine<00:00:53.280> comes<00:00:53.460> off<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> usual

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
magazine magazine comes off in the usual

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.310 
magazine magazine comes off in the usual
way<00:00:55.699> we'll<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.090> course<00:00:57.149> cock<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.719> check<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
way we'll of course cock it check this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.810 
way we'll of course cock it check this
there's<00:00:58.649> nothing<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.039> needless<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.850> say

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
there's nothing in it needless to say

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.460 
there's nothing in it needless to say
that's<00:01:05.180> not<00:01:06.180> available<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.140> isn't

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that's not available to you this isn't

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.570 
that's not available to you this isn't
that<00:01:07.830> cannot<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.150> okay<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
that cannot be around in there okay so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.300 
that cannot be around in there okay so
just<00:01:11.580> rip<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> usual<00:01:12.180> way<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> I'll

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just rip it in the usual way so I'll

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.270 
just rip it in the usual way so I'll
remove<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> top<00:01:15.000> cover

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
remove the top cover

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.870 
remove the top cover
take<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> bolt<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> bolt<00:01:19.140> carrier

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
take out the bolt and the bolt carrier

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.880 
take out the bolt and the bolt carrier
and<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> D<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> size<00:01:24.890> now

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and there you can see the D in size now

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.609 
and there you can see the D in size now
just<00:01:26.820> close<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:28.850> as<00:01:29.850> per<00:01:30.360> normal<00:01:30.619> field

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
just close that up as per normal field

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:41.660 
just close that up as per normal field
stripping<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.939> gas<00:01:33.840> plug<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.780> removed<00:01:40.670> last

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
stripping the gas plug is removed last

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
stripping the gas plug is removed last
time<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.630> fine<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.990> chap<00:01:43.170> didn't<00:01:43.380> clean

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
time this was fine a chap didn't clean

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.730 
time this was fine a chap didn't clean
it<00:01:43.530> very<00:01:43.740> well<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> doing<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:49.290> course<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it very well the doing and of course the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.480 
it very well the doing and of course the
unlike<00:01:50.340> most<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> modern

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
unlike most of the modern

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.510 
unlike most of the modern
DX<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.450> has<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> moving<00:01:55.130> gas<00:01:56.130> regulator

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
DX this one has a moving gas regulator

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
DX this one has a moving gas regulator
as<00:01:56.729> well<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:57.899> essentially<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.469> for

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
as well and that's essentially it for

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.300 
as well and that's essentially it for
the<00:01:58.740> field<00:01:58.860> stripping<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.560> bolt<00:02:01.770> carrier<00:02:02.189> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the field stripping the bolt carrier and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
the field stripping the bolt carrier and
the<00:02:02.880> bolt<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.420> same<00:02:03.630> words<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.899> always<00:02:04.049> used

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the bolt the same words are always used

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.880 
the bolt the same words are always used
-<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.000> that's<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.180> bolt<00:02:06.439> it's<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:07.619> good<00:02:07.799> in

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
- and that's the bolt it's not good in

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
- and that's the bolt it's not good in
half<00:02:08.539> neither<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> ball<00:02:09.959> carrier<00:02:10.319> you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
half neither is the ball carrier you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.730 
half neither is the ball carrier you
still<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> rat's<00:02:11.160> tail

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
still have the rat's tail

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.120 
still have the rat's tail
and<00:02:13.040> essentially<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:14.740> missing<00:02:15.740> bit<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.100> that

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and essentially the missing bit is that

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.220 
and essentially the missing bit is that
the<00:02:16.370> bolt<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:17.410> cut<00:02:18.410> at<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.590> 45<00:02:19.010> degree<00:02:19.040> angle<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the bolt is cut at a 45 degree angle the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.550 
the bolt is cut at a 45 degree angle the
firing<00:02:21.650> pin<00:02:21.920> has<00:02:22.760> been<00:02:23.120> removed<00:02:23.480> as<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.440> can

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
firing pin has been removed as you can

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.040 
firing pin has been removed as you can
see<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.710> firing<00:02:28.250> pin<00:02:28.430> per<00:02:29.030> channel<00:02:29.300> has

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
see and the firing pin per channel has

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.940 
see and the firing pin per channel has
been<00:02:30.320> welded<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.580> not<00:02:31.820> welded<00:02:32.150> solid

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
been welded but it's not welded solid

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.090 
been welded but it's not welded solid
with<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.600> receiver

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
with the receiver

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.010 
with the receiver
the<00:02:37.820> BOP<00:02:38.630> carrier<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.380> essentially<00:02:40.160> unchanged

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
the BOP carrier is essentially unchanged

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.440 
the BOP carrier is essentially unchanged
of<00:02:42.020> course<00:02:42.290> there's<00:02:42.470> no<00:02:42.590> hole<00:02:42.770> for<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.450> sorry

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
of course there's no hole for the sorry

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.670 
of course there's no hole for the sorry
there's<00:02:44.690> no<00:02:44.810> firing<00:02:45.080> pin<00:02:45.550> hammer<00:02:46.550> in<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.450> hole

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
there's no firing pin hammer in the hole

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.110 
there's no firing pin hammer in the hole
but<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:48.800> essentially<00:02:49.400> unchanged<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:53.000> as

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
but that's essentially unchanged so as

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.010 
but that's essentially unchanged so as
you<00:02:53.210> can<00:02:53.300> see<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:56.890> field<00:02:57.890> stripping<00:02:59.020> for

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
you can see that is field stripping for

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:35.760 
you can see that is field stripping for
the<00:03:00.110> SLR

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.170 
you wouldn't do on a common spec diac
also<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.290> safety<00:04:00.620> catch<00:04:00.800> moves<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.430> leave<00:04:02.030> it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
also the safety catch moves I leave it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.930 
also the safety catch moves I leave it
in<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.390> safe<00:04:02.600> position<00:04:02.800> nothing<00:04:03.800> happens<00:04:04.220> if

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
in the safe position nothing happens if

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.930 
in the safe position nothing happens if
I<00:04:05.030> move<00:04:05.270> it<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:06.100> round<00:04:07.100> positional<00:04:07.730> fire

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
I move it to the round positional fire

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.340 
I move it to the round positional fire
position<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.560> actually<00:04:10.130> moving<00:04:10.480> ok<00:04:11.480> yeah

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
position it is actually moving ok yeah

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.800 
position it is actually moving ok yeah
of<00:04:13.160> course<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.640> doesn't<00:04:13.820> actually<00:04:14.150> fire

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
of course it doesn't actually fire

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.660 
of course it doesn't actually fire
because<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.470> trigger<00:04:18.680> making<00:04:18.980> in<00:04:19.160> has

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
because the the trigger making in has

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.140 
because the the trigger making in has
been<00:04:20.269> deactivated<00:04:21.280> what's<00:04:22.280> doing<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.670> Vista

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
been deactivated what's doing is Vista

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.560 
been deactivated what's doing is Vista
moving<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.960> trigger<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:25.430> if<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.760> can<00:04:28.570> that's

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
moving the trigger and if I can that's

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.610 
moving the trigger and if I can that's
it<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:33.470> makes<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.740> UK<00:04:34.040> legal<00:04:35.290> but<00:04:36.290> as<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.470> can

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
it that makes it UK legal but as you can

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.850 
it that makes it UK legal but as you can
