the<00:03:55.020> MiGs<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.410> lot<00:03:55.560> fatter<00:03:55.890> that's<00:03:56.190> for<00:03:56.430> sure

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
the MiGs a lot fatter that's for sure

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.530 
the MiGs a lot fatter that's for sure
the<00:03:58.410> habbo<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> lot<00:03:59.370> more<00:03:59.400> streamline<00:04:00.270> you

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the habbo is a lot more streamline you

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.790 
the habbo is a lot more streamline you
can<00:04:00.690> see<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.440> be<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> lot

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
can see that it's going to be a lot

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.370 
can see that it's going to be a lot
faster<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.670> because<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:03.660> got<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.900> pointy

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
faster just because it's got a pointy

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.750 
faster just because it's got a pointy
nose<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.220> be<00:04:05.310> taking<00:04:05.670> all

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
nose it's not going to be taking all

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.940 
nose it's not going to be taking all
that<00:04:05.880> air<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.390> there<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:07.440> those<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.830> already

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950
