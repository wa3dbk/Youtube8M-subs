00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
when you just do something like this we

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
when you just do something like this we
just<00:01:56.790> put<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.240> blocks<00:01:57.869> down<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
just put some blocks down here and you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.200 
just put some blocks down here and you
can<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:59.040> when<00:01:59.640> you're<00:01:59.790> dealing<00:02:00.030> with

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
can see when you're dealing with

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
can see when you're dealing with
something<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.719> full<00:02:00.990> HD<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.680> side

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
something like full HD like this side

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
something like full HD like this side
here<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.729> only<00:02:02.969> got<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.180> ability<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
here it's only got the ability to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.289 
here it's only got the ability to
capture<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.290> certain<00:02:04.680> number<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.040> pixels<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
capture a certain number of pixels and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.859 
capture a certain number of pixels and
so<00:02:06.450> therefore<00:02:06.770> detail<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.369> lost<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so therefore detail can get lost and you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.290 
so therefore detail can get lost and you
know<00:02:09.959> individual<00:02:10.590> picture<00:02:10.920> elements

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
know individual picture elements

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.730 
know individual picture elements
you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> sort<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.870> final<00:02:13.200> gradations

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you know the sort of final gradations

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.040 
you know the sort of final gradations
get<00:02:14.310> lost<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:14.790> you're<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.570> know<00:02:15.660> compared

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
get lost when you're you know compared

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.530 
get lost when you're you know compared
to<00:02:16.110> something<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:16.440> okay<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.730> side<00:02:17.970> so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to something like okay on the side so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420 
to something like okay on the side so
that's<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> first<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.590> about<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.070> you've

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
that's the first thing about it you've

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.760 
that's the first thing about it you've
got<00:02:20.670> much<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:21.270> detail<00:02:21.690> sort<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.680> more

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
got much more detail sort of more

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.680 
got much more detail sort of more
realistic<00:02:23.070> looking<00:02:23.400> pictures<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.600> not

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
realistic looking pictures and it's not

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.420 
realistic looking pictures and it's not
just<00:02:24.750> for<00:02:25.110> video<00:02:25.380> either<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:26.250> we're

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
just for video either because we're

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
just for video either because we're
talking<00:02:26.760> about<00:02:26.880> eight<00:02:27.210> megapixels<00:02:27.990> for<00:02:28.350> each

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
talking about eight megapixels for each

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.890 
talking about eight megapixels for each
individual<00:02:29.250> frame<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.880> video<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.750> means

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
individual frame and video so that means

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.690 
individual frame and video so that means
that<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.230> take<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.470> video<00:02:31.710> frame<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.610> know

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that you can take a video frame you know

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.160 
that you can take a video frame you know
kid<00:02:33.000> jumping<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> trampoline<00:02:33.450> something

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
kid jumping on a trampoline something

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.170 
kid jumping on a trampoline something
like<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.460> pull<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.820> out<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
like that and you can pull it out and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
like that and you can pull it out and
you've<00:02:36.720> got<00:02:36.870> an<00:02:36.930> 8<00:02:37.020> megapixel<00:02:37.170> still<00:02:37.770> photo

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you've got an 8 megapixel still photo

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.010 
you've got an 8 megapixel still photo
which<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.340> perfectly<00:02:38.790> adequate<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.690> printing

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
which is perfectly adequate for printing

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.080 
which is perfectly adequate for printing
out<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.890> know<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.280> still<00:02:41.400> photos<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
out so you know but still photos and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.060 
out so you know but still photos and
good<00:02:42.270> video<00:02:42.510> at<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.170> same<00:02:43.380> time<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> 4k

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
good video at the same time on a 4k

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.800 
good video at the same time on a 4k
camera<00:02:44.550> there's<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.150> couple<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.480> other<00:02:45.600> tricks

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
camera there's a couple of other tricks

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.720 
camera there's a couple of other tricks
as<00:02:46.080> well<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.680> you've<00:02:46.890> got<00:02:47.070> those<00:02:47.220> extra

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
as well because you've got those extra

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.640 
as well because you've got those extra
pixels<00:02:48.180> as<00:02:48.360> well<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.780> sort<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.080> pixel

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
pixels as well if you sort of pixel

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.650 
pixels as well if you sort of pixel
manipulations<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.120> for

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
manipulations that you can do for

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.510 
manipulations that you can do for
example<00:02:52.200> yeah<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.710> first<00:02:53.190> thing<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.370> gotta

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
example yeah so the first thing we gotta

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.150 
example yeah so the first thing we gotta
talk<00:02:53.640> about<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.270> sterilization<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.440> Tim

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
talk about is like sterilization so Tim

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.620 
talk about is like sterilization so Tim
was<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.490> mentioned<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.300> know<00:02:57.390> for

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
was just mentioned that you know for

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.450 
was just mentioned that you know for
care<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> lot<00:02:58.530> more<00:02:58.740> pixel<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> lot

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
care you have a lot more pixel a lot

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.520 
care you have a lot more pixel a lot
more<00:02:59.640> details<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.600> full<00:03:00.810> HD<00:03:01.110> what<00:03:01.230> happened

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
more details with full HD what happened

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.960 
more details with full HD what happened
is<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.830> know<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:01.980> can<00:03:02.190> actually<00:03:02.310> crop<00:03:02.760> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
is you know you can actually crop it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.230 
is you know you can actually crop it
down<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:04.650> stabilization<00:03:05.090> inside<00:03:06.090> of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
down and with stabilization inside of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.390 
down and with stabilization inside of
software<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.050> know<00:03:07.170> Vegas<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.890> post

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
software like you know Vegas in post

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.120 
software like you know Vegas in post
editing<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.720> if<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.380> movement<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:11.010> your

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
editing you if you have movement on your

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.490 
editing you if you have movement on your
camera<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.550> can<00:03:11.580> actually<00:03:11.910> add<00:03:12.500> some

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
camera you can actually add some

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.890 
camera you can actually add some
stabilization<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> actual<00:03:15.030> video<00:03:15.330> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
stabilization to to the actual video so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.420 
stabilization to to the actual video so
this<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.230> actually<00:03:16.380> me<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:17.190> down

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
this is actually me like going down

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.420 
this is actually me like going down
darling<00:03:18.120> L<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.770> is<00:03:19.950> now<00:03:20.100> like

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
darling L and this is now like

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.890 
darling L and this is now like
stabilized<00:03:21.060> when<00:03:21.810> unstabilized<00:03:22.350> sorry<00:03:22.680> oh

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
stabilized when unstabilized sorry oh

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.210 
stabilized when unstabilized sorry oh
this<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.050> not<00:03:25.350> stable<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> original

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this is not stable this is the original

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.580 
this is not stable this is the original
this<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.910> your<00:03:27.060> National<00:03:27.390> nice<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.930> shaky<00:03:28.410> and

as we you know add the civilization you
will<00:03:31.530> see<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.010> there<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:33.630> video<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.350> know

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
will see you there the video is you know

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.220 
will see you there the video is you know
way<00:03:35.580> more<00:03:35.610> stabilized<00:03:36.300> easy<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.930> actually

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
way more stabilized easy to actually

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.229 
way more stabilized easy to actually
work<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.980> put<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:38.430> production<00:03:38.730> yeah

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
work with to put in your production yeah

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.900 
work with to put in your production yeah
so<00:03:39.840> everyone<00:03:40.140> if<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.560> if<00:03:40.860> we<00:03:41.070> pause<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.610> it's

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
so everyone if you if we pause it it's

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.430 
so everyone if you if we pause it it's
probably<00:03:42.120> easier<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:43.110> what's<00:03:43.290> actually

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
probably easier to see what's actually

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.440 
probably easier to see what's actually
going<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:44.010> here<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.790> can<00:03:45.000> see<00:03:45.030> we've<00:03:45.420> got

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
going on here so you can see we've got

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.720 
going on here so you can see we've got
this<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> stabilized<00:03:46.470> very<00:03:47.220> NHC

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
this is the stabilized very NHC

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.880 
this is the stabilized very NHC
unstabilized<00:03:48.360> original<00:03:48.930> image<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.739> can

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
unstabilized original image so you can

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.170 
unstabilized original image so you can
see<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.070> are<00:03:50.100> cropping<00:03:50.430> into<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> little<00:03:51.060> bit

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
see we are cropping into it a little bit

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.699 
see we are cropping into it a little bit
but<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.930> keep<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.230> mind<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.530> you've

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
but you have to keep in mind that you've

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.590 
but you have to keep in mind that you've
got<00:03:52.890> four<00:03:53.250> times<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.700> number<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.970> pixels<00:03:54.209> on

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
got four times the number of pixels on

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.360 
got four times the number of pixels on
there<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.020> so<00:03:55.230> therefore<00:03:55.440> cropping<00:03:56.010> into<00:03:56.220> it

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
there and so therefore cropping into it

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.310 
there and so therefore cropping into it
really<00:03:56.790> doesn't<00:03:57.180> matter<00:03:57.270> too<00:03:57.900> much<00:03:57.930> at<00:03:58.260> all

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
really doesn't matter too much at all

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.260 
really doesn't matter too much at all
because<00:03:58.620> you've<00:03:58.890> got<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.070> much<00:03:59.430> extra<00:03:59.790> detail

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
because you've got so much extra detail

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.620 
because you've got so much extra detail
to<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.959> able<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.850> reproduce<00:04:02.850> these<00:04:03.180> images

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
to be able to reproduce these images

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.270 
to be able to reproduce these images
yeah<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.500> there's<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.770> few<00:04:04.800> other<00:04:04.950> things<00:04:05.130> you

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
yeah so there's a few other things you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.470 
yeah so there's a few other things you
can<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.489> with<00:04:05.550> cropping<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.000> well<00:04:06.150> such<00:04:06.450> as

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
can do with cropping as well such as

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.229 
can do with cropping as well such as
reframing<00:04:07.260> right<00:04:07.560> yeah<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> look

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
reframing right yeah if you have a look

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.970 
reframing right yeah if you have a look
at<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.390> video<00:04:09.480> right<00:04:09.840> here<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.470> like<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
at the video right here this is like the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.449 
at the video right here this is like the
4k<00:04:11.790> video<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:13.200> can<00:04:13.350> actually<00:04:13.680> select<00:04:13.920> part<00:04:14.340> of

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
4k video you can actually select part of

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.620 
4k video you can actually select part of
the<00:04:14.550> screen<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.810> can<00:04:15.959> actually<00:04:16.169> in

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
the screen and you can actually in

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.080 
the screen and you can actually in
have<00:04:17.020> that<00:04:17.230> white<00:04:17.590> square<00:04:17.950> there<00:04:18.220> which<00:04:18.760> means

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
have that white square there which means

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.120 
have that white square there which means
that<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.630> actually<00:04:19.930> going<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.739> display

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
that it is actually going to display

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.310 
that it is actually going to display
just<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.760> part<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.300> image<00:04:22.450> or<00:04:22.930> if<00:04:23.200> you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
just that part of the image or if you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.410 
just that part of the image or if you
just<00:04:23.350> want<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.770> have<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.640> people<00:04:24.790> walking

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
just want to have the the people walking

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.360 
just want to have the the people walking
on<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.720> side<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.410> can<00:04:26.620> actually<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.280> know

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
on the side you can actually you know

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.730 
on the side you can actually you know
square<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.150> too<00:04:28.600> they're<00:04:28.990> all<00:04:29.410> right<00:04:29.560> so

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
square that too they're all right so

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.620 
square that too they're all right so
looking<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.130> on<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.250> TV<00:04:30.490> then<00:04:30.880> yeah<00:04:31.390> so<00:04:31.570> you

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
looking it on a TV then yeah so you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.450 
looking it on a TV then yeah so you
eventually<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.140> is<00:04:32.290> still<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.500> full<00:04:32.710> HD<00:04:33.100> image

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
eventually this is still a full HD image

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.790 
eventually this is still a full HD image
but<00:04:34.210> you've<00:04:34.960> got<00:04:35.140> the<00:04:35.230> ability<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.650> actually

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
but you've got the ability to actually

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.890 
but you've got the ability to actually
reframe<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.490> yeah<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.120> was<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.480> 4k

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
reframe it yeah so this was like a 4k

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.320 
reframe it yeah so this was like a 4k
video<00:04:38.260> but<00:04:38.680> if<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.220> go<00:04:39.250> back<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.150> actual

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
video but if I go back to the the actual

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.370 
video but if I go back to the the actual
cropping<00:04:41.280> yeah<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:43.390> can<00:04:43.630> basically<00:04:43.840> change

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
cropping yeah I can basically change

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.740 
cropping yeah I can basically change
different<00:04:44.800> shift<00:04:45.310> around<00:04:45.580> and<00:04:45.910> went<00:04:46.600> inside

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
different shift around and went inside

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.450 
different shift around and went inside
the<00:04:47.020> engine<00:04:47.260> still<00:04:47.470> get<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.680> good<00:04:47.950> high

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
the engine still get a good high

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.160 
the engine still get a good high
resolution<00:04:49.000> image<00:04:49.210> all<00:04:49.630> right<00:04:49.720> that's<00:04:49.990> very

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
resolution image all right that's very

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.630 
resolution image all right that's very
cool<00:04:50.320> it's<00:04:50.470> actually<00:04:50.620> really<00:04:50.950> useful<00:04:51.040> for

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
cool it's actually really useful for

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.980 
cool it's actually really useful for
people<00:04:51.730> who<00:04:51.970> are<00:04:52.090> doing<00:04:52.180> bit<00:04:52.390> of<00:04:52.480> editing<00:04:52.600> as

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
people who are doing bit of editing as

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.960 
people who are doing bit of editing as
well<00:04:53.170> I<00:04:53.680> know<00:04:53.980> you<00:04:54.160> having<00:04:54.610> done<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.790> bit<00:04:54.940> of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
well I know you having done a bit of

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.670 
well I know you having done a bit of
video<00:04:55.120> video<00:04:55.570> editing<00:04:55.900> before<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.500> either

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
video video editing before if you either

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.620 
video video editing before if you either
try<00:04:56.980> to<00:04:57.010> eat<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.550> somebody<00:04:58.090> who's<00:04:58.240> doing<00:04:58.510> an

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
try to eat it somebody who's doing an

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.560 
try to eat it somebody who's doing an
interview<00:04:59.170> for<00:04:59.860> example<00:05:00.310> often<00:05:00.880> you'll<00:05:01.180> want

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
interview for example often you'll want

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.060 
interview for example often you'll want
to<00:05:01.600> take<00:05:01.780> out<00:05:02.050> their<00:05:02.260> little<00:05:02.380> lumps<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:02.920> ours

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
to take out their little lumps and ours

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.190 
to take out their little lumps and ours
and<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.760> some<00:05:04.210> of<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.540> know<00:05:04.600> information

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
and and some of the you know information

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.870 
and and some of the you know information
that<00:05:05.320> you<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.710> know<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:06.070> know<00:05:06.580> necessarily

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
that you you know you know necessarily

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.240 
that you you know you know necessarily
needing<00:05:07.510> so<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.410> ability<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.130> achieve

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
needing so the ability to achieve

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.430 
needing so the ability to achieve
reframing<00:05:09.910> image<00:05:10.330> means<00:05:10.570> that<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.960> can<00:05:11.140> take

and all of them at least full HD
resolution<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:36.400> couldn't<00:05:36.970> be<00:05:37.030> usable<00:05:37.450> as<00:05:37.600> well

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
resolution so couldn't be usable as well

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.230 
resolution so couldn't be usable as well
so<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:39.160> know<00:05:39.250> it's<00:05:39.460> it's<00:05:39.730> something<00:05:40.090> that's

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
pretty exciting even if you're only

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.760 
pretty exciting even if you're only
using<00:05:42.220> a<00:05:42.460> full<00:05:42.610> HD<00:05:42.940> TV<00:05:43.300> or<00:05:43.570> about<00:05:44.380> putting<00:05:44.680> your

using a full HD TV or about putting your

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.650 
using a full HD TV or about putting your
video<00:05:44.950> for<00:05:45.130> only<00:05:45.310> full<00:05:45.460> HD<00:05:45.850> being<00:05:46.450> able<00:05:46.600> to

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
capture it in 4k resolution means you

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.940 
capture it in 4k resolution means you
know<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.660> number<00:05:49.900> of<00:05:50.050> benefits<00:05:50.260> in<00:05:50.680> terms<00:05:50.710> of

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
know a number of benefits in terms of

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.620 
know a number of benefits in terms of
what<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.220> can<00:05:51.370> do<00:05:51.550> with<00:05:51.730> it<00:05:51.850> but<00:05:52.420> also

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
what you can do with it but also

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.810 
what you can do with it but also
obviously<00:05:53.470> if<00:05:53.800> you're<00:05:54.040> caught<00:05:54.430> recording

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
obviously if you're caught recording

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.670 
obviously if you're caught recording
your<00:05:54.880> memories<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.840> key<00:05:56.050> thing<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.320> that<00:05:56.620> you

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
your memories the key thing is that you

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.780 
your memories the key thing is that you
want<00:05:56.830> to<00:05:56.860> be<00:05:56.920> able<00:05:57.010> to<00:05:57.160> record<00:05:57.400> in<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.580> highest

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
want to be able to record in the highest

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.520 
want to be able to record in the highest
quality<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.450> you<00:05:58.510> possibly<00:05:58.780> can<00:05:59.200> so<00:05:59.410> it's

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
quality that you possibly can so it's

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.350 
quality that you possibly can so it's
going<00:05:59.620> to<00:05:59.680> look<00:05:59.770> good<00:06:00.070> many<00:06:00.760> years<00:06:00.850> from<00:06:01.150> now

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
tapes you know if you had to copy the

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.610

song<00:06:24.790> from<00:06:25.060> this

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
song from this

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.540 
song from this
that<00:06:25.740> time<00:06:25.979> as<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.729> copied<00:06:27.180> them<00:06:27.389> along<00:06:27.690> the

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
that time as you copied them along the

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.310 
that time as you copied them along the
quality<00:06:29.550> degraded<00:06:30.300> yeah<00:06:30.600> so<00:06:30.750> think<00:06:31.050> about<00:06:31.110> it

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
quality degraded yeah so think about it

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.530 
quality degraded yeah so think about it
this<00:06:31.440> way<00:06:31.500> this<00:06:32.010> is<00:06:32.160> like<00:06:32.280> full<00:06:32.490> HD<00:06:32.850> and<00:06:33.090> if<00:06:33.360> you

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
this way this is like full HD and if you

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.990 
this way this is like full HD and if you
like<00:06:33.750> you<00:06:33.960> know<00:06:34.169> compressing<00:06:35.010> it<00:06:35.100> to<00:06:35.310> or<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.970> a

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
like you know compressing it to or to a

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.390 
like you know compressing it to or to a
full<00:06:36.660> HD<00:06:37.020> you<00:06:37.440> will<00:06:37.590> actually<00:06:37.770> lose<00:06:38.070> some<00:06:38.280> of

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
full HD you will actually lose some of

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.600 
full HD you will actually lose some of
the<00:06:38.580> quality<00:06:39.000> now<00:06:39.770> think<00:06:40.770> about<00:06:40.830> 4k<00:06:41.340> like<00:06:41.580> a

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
the quality now think about 4k like a

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.600 
the quality now think about 4k like a
like<00:06:42.030> a<00:06:42.060> CD<00:06:42.540> so<00:06:42.810> once<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.199> had<00:06:43.650> this<00:06:43.889> CD

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
like a CD so once you had this CD

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.730 
like a CD so once you had this CD
digital<00:06:44.940> master<00:06:45.449> and<00:06:45.840> you<00:06:46.229> were<00:06:46.350> putting<00:06:46.590> it

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
digital master and you were putting it
