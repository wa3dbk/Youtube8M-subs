00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.140
 hello good morning everyone 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.880
 making some tops the game 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 so that all of you have 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 asked 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.080
 to god for allowing me to be 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.080
 you today, Wednesday, we are going to start 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 the ingredients that we are going to use in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.559
 this wall of visitor's belt will be a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.989
 celery stems a medium chard stalk 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.420
 carrot half cucumber and if you want a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
 same sweet you can add pears or 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.670
 apples is already at the cost of each 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.460
 fourth can also use both 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.770
 and how 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.240
 let's wash the vegetables very well 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.010
 remove the land that the field brings 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.480
 to remove the sheets for this is 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.480
 use them in other things 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.470
 we started to remove the leaves from the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.450
 stems 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.110
 we can use these sheets in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.790
 creams for babies for the home for 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.790
 that we are not going to waste them 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.630
 we remove the cucumber peel 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.150
 we remove the skin of the carrot 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.860
 because it already attracts many insecticides 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.210
 then they will not contribute anything 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.210
 nutritious to the body 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.320
 it is good to moisturize the carrot 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.320
 to make the most of 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.640
 we must make our goals intoxicating 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 this 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 the sweet fruits and you're 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.380
 part in four so that they go from 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 Easy way by extract 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.760
 we remove the seeds because it is very 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.370
 comfortable to consume juice 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.540
 now as a child 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.579
 initially we will start when 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.069
 then the sweet fruits so that 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.560
 also take advantage of the fryer not the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.700
 let's waste and then also the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.700
 we can consume 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.879
 we are going to remove the fiber from the fruits 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.030
 sweet then is the cucumber the 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.739
 carrot the apple and the green pear the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.590
 let's move on to a plate for later 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.379
 consume it or if we have pets too 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.069
 we can give them to her later 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:05.370
 let's go through the extractor the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.370
 stems such as celery and chard 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:15.489
 add celery stalks stems 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.489
 of spinach and chard stems 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.159
 good, my duties already know that this juice 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.709
 they can use it as food all 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.590
 the days is simply for 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.769
 detoxify to eight or fifteen days is very 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.780
 good for cardiovascular problems 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:47.299
 respiratory knows that delicious to me 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:47.299
 I personally love your health 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.830
 and
