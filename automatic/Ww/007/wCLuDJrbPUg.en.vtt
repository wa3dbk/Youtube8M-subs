00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 to make mouldable pasta at home 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 very few ingredients are needed and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 a very simple procedure that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can do together with your children ai 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.559
 their little friends 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.290
 we will use flour 0 230 grams 5 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.020
 10 grams of vegetable glycerol 100 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.989
 grams of salt up to 30 grams of oil 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.809
 sunflower seeds 20 grams of pre mortar 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.149
 taro and boiling water as required 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.149
 make the dough easy to shape 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.590
 we start from the flour always used 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.590
 a scale in g 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:14.550
 and salt up to 100 grams 30 grams of oil 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.979
 of seeds and two sachets of cream of tartar 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.380
 tartar cream is a natural yeast 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.190
 which is now also found in the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.350
 supermarkets 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.470
 the two sachets correspond more or less 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.020
 at about twenty grams each sachet 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.020
 different so maybe you weigh the wait 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 of the first we add about 300 g of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.290
 very hot water and let's start a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 work the dough first with a 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.440
 wooden spoon since the water is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.950
 very very hot and trying to get 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.170
 a consistency as much as possible 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 rubbery will soon be possible 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.340
 work the dough directly with the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.470
 hands when the dough will be a little 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.009
 cooled you can get help from 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.009
 your children 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.920
 at this point you can start 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 use vegetable glycerol ne 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.000
 they go more or less 10 grams though 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.490
 I always recommend developing a certain 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.610
 eye in the measurements serves to give 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:27.360
 consistency and a little elasticity to 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360
 our mouldable paste 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.600
 if the dough turns out to be too much 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.660
 sticky you can powder there 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.660
 hands of flour and continue to work it 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.860
 now our base is ready and not 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.620
 all you have to do is color it to color it 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.000
 lots of choices available to you 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.000
 both natural and artificial 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.280
 use as many bowls as you can 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.370
 colors you will want to do we will realize 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:12.090
 3 and then divide the dough into three 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.160
 the portions are so many choices 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.770
 we can use dyes 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.390
 natural like spices for example for 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.450
 get the yellow we will use the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.980
 turmeric we can use gods 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.110
 food dyes that are found 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.420
 easily in supermarkets 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.070
 so to make red we will use a 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.470
 food coloring 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.330
 or if you want to use as you 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.060
 advice of natural remedies 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.240
 you can dedicate yourself to research in 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.970
 herbal tinctoria herbalists in this 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.250
 if chlorophyll for example will get 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.300
 the green color 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.300
 let's start with turmeric 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.629
 depending on how intense you want the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.349
 your yellow you can add more or 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.349
 less turmeric 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.130
 stir together for about a minute 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.220
 the dough however becoming cold becomes 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.400
 much more malleable and easy to 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.400
 to work 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.090
 ok this is the yellow now we do in 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.090
 another colors 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.099
 and now let's turn to red and 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.259
 we'll use something else again 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.370
 that is a food coloring can be 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.699
 buy safely in 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.699
 supermarkets 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.490
 the modeling paste thus made yes 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.100
 keeps in a container of 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 metal or plastic closed for some 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.410
 months 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.500
 every time the network resumes it will be 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.500
 always soft and ready for every game 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.070
 done
