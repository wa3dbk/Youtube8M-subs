super easy so let's get started the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.550 
super easy so let's get started the
first<00:00:37.240> thing<00:00:37.390> I<00:00:37.480> did<00:00:37.540> was<00:00:37.840> preheat<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.530> oven

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560

to<00:00:38.890> 400<00:00:39.340> degrees<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:39.970> I've<00:00:40.570> melted<00:00:40.960> half<00:00:41.829> a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
to 400 degrees and I've melted half a

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.990 
to 400 degrees and I've melted half a
cup<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.250> butter<00:00:42.460> which<00:00:42.790> is<00:00:43.000> one<00:00:43.210> stick<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
cup of butter which is one stick and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.569 
cup of butter which is one stick and
I've<00:00:46.660> got<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.990> phyllo<00:00:47.290> pastry<00:00:47.829> I'm<00:00:48.100> going<00:00:48.430> to

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.950 
I've got the phyllo pastry I'm going to
work<00:00:48.670> very<00:00:48.730> quickly<00:00:49.210> but<00:00:49.480> it's<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.690> good<00:00:49.840> idea

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
work very quickly but it's a good idea

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.050 
work very quickly but it's a good idea
to<00:00:50.290> keep<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.680> covered<00:00:50.890> with<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.190> damp<00:00:51.430> cloth<00:00:51.610> as

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
to keep it covered with a damp cloth as

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.640 
to keep it covered with a damp cloth as
you<00:00:52.390> use<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.780> so<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:53.200> doesn't<00:00:53.350> dry<00:00:53.620> out

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
you use it so that it doesn't dry out

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.350 
you use it so that it doesn't dry out
because<00:00:54.100> it's<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:54.430> thin<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:54.880> delicate<00:00:54.970> it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
because it's so thin and delicate it

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.110 
because it's so thin and delicate it
dries<00:00:55.540> out<00:00:55.690> very<00:00:55.750> quickly<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.760> I'm<00:00:57.820> just<00:00:58.000> going

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120
