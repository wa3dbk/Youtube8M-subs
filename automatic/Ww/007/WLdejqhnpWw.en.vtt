together<00:03:41.470> they<00:03:41.890> could<00:03:42.040> do<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.190> themselves

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
together they could do it themselves

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.280 
together they could do it themselves
which<00:03:42.730> is<00:03:42.880> why<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.239> didn't<00:03:43.480> offer<00:03:43.630> our<00:03:43.930> fencing

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
which is why I didn't offer our fencing

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.420 
which is why I didn't offer our fencing
program<00:03:44.650> because<00:03:44.920> if<00:03:45.040> they<00:03:45.160> can<00:03:45.340> do<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
program because if they can do it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.580 
program because if they can do it
themselves<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.720> would<00:03:46.810> be<00:03:46.959> way<00:03:47.320> better<00:03:47.350> for

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
themselves that would be way better for

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.110 
themselves that would be way better for
us<00:03:47.890> because<00:03:48.100> then<00:03:48.250> we<00:03:48.310> can<00:03:48.519> use<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.850> up<00:03:48.910> until

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
us because then we can use it up until

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.340 
us because then we can use it up until
to<00:03:49.330> help<00:03:49.480> somebody<00:03:49.600> else<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:49.959> really<00:03:50.170> needs
