okay<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.900> am<00:00:01.589> building<00:00:01.920> an<00:00:02.040> electric

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay I am building an electric

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.079 
okay I am building an electric
motorcycle<00:00:03.140> and<00:00:04.140> with<00:00:04.440> my<00:00:04.770> father-in-law<00:00:05.520> who

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
motorcycle and with my father-in-law who

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.790 
motorcycle and with my father-in-law who
is<00:00:06.529> building<00:00:07.580> an<00:00:08.580> electric<00:00:09.800> ultralight

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
is building an electric ultralight

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.459 
is building an electric ultralight
airplane<00:00:11.280> we're<00:00:12.090> both<00:00:12.240> working<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> circuit

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
airplane we're both working on a circuit

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.000 
airplane we're both working on a circuit
designed<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.670> run<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.269> DC<00:00:15.990> brushless<00:00:16.199> motor<00:00:16.680> so

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
designed to run a DC brushless motor so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.130 
designed to run a DC brushless motor so
here's<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.520> motor<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.720> currently<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
here's the motor it's currently got a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.750 
here's the motor it's currently got a
propeller<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.980> because<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> good<00:00:20.609> way

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
propeller on it because it's a good way

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.050 
propeller on it because it's a good way
of<00:00:20.789> applying<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.359> load<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.760> we're<00:00:23.760> running<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
of applying a load and we're running a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
of applying a load and we're running a
small<00:00:24.740> processor<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.859> control<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> whole

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
small processor to control the whole

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.429 
small processor to control the whole
thing<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.880> haven't<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:27.779> auto<00:00:27.930> startup

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
thing I haven't got an auto startup

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
thing I haven't got an auto startup
sequence<00:00:28.650> programmed<00:00:29.460> yet<00:00:29.789> although<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.240> have

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
sequence programmed yet although I have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
sequence programmed yet although I have
in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> past<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:32.070> getting<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> way

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
in the past it's it's getting in the way

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
in the past it's it's getting in the way
of<00:00:32.759> being<00:00:33.420> productive<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.050> areas<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
of being productive in other areas so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
of being productive in other areas so
Donnie<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> give<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> prop

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
Donnie is going to have to give the prop

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
Donnie is going to have to give the prop
a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.809> kick<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.559> started<00:00:38.390> here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
a little kick for it to get started here

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.310 
a little kick for it to get started here
are<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.750> batteries<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.260> are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
are the two batteries that are

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
are the two batteries that are
controlling<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> meter<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
controlling it and the meter that

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.400 
controlling it and the meter that
measures<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.489> current<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.870> looks<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.200> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
measures the current it looks like this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.889 
measures the current it looks like this
circuit<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.789> handling<00:00:48.329> about<00:00:48.600> two

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
circuit right now is handling about two

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.319 
circuit right now is handling about two
horsepower<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.489> hope<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.910> ultimately

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
horsepower but we hope to ultimately

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.680 
horsepower but we hope to ultimately
have<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.809> 20<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.059> obviously<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.539> need

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
have about 20 and obviously when we need

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
have about 20 and obviously when we need
more<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.770> stack<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> few<00:00:56.399> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
more we can actually stack a few of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
more we can actually stack a few of
these<00:00:56.579> circuits<00:00:56.940> together<00:00:57.270> or<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> few<00:00:57.870> motors

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
these circuits together or a few motors

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.260 
these circuits together or a few motors
together<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> final<00:00:59.910> motor

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
together this is not the final motor

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.110 
together this is not the final motor
there<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.590> larger<00:01:01.969> here's<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
there it would be much larger here's the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
there it would be much larger here's the
software<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.049> controlling<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.650> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
software for controlling it at this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.660 
software for controlling it at this
point<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.330> I'll<00:01:06.689> start<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:07.530> Donnie

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.899 

going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> spin<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:13.909> go

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
going to spin it that way all right go

00:01:14.909 --> 00:02:07.400 
going to spin it that way all right go
right

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.540 

 was<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.679> was<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.550> piece<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:09.880> paper<00:02:10.270> that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:25.770 

nuff<00:02:18.390> well<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:21.099> think<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.390> hit<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:23.940> 30<00:02:24.940> amps

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
nuff well I think we hit about 30 amps

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.720 
nuff well I think we hit about 30 amps
there<00:02:30.480> say<00:02:31.480> bye-bye
