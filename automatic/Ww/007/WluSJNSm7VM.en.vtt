00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.749 
first step which is the espresso but
then<00:01:48.989> when<00:01:49.169> we<00:01:49.259> get<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.590> second<00:01:50.039> step<00:01:50.279> it's

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
then when we get to the second step it's

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.949 
then when we get to the second step it's
going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.999> read<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.299> barcode<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.749> it's<00:01:51.869> going

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
going to read the barcode and it's going

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.059 
going to read the barcode and it's going
to<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.169> something<00:01:52.469> completely<00:01:52.649> different

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
to do something completely different

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.309 
to do something completely different
because<00:01:53.639> they're<00:01:54.329> different<00:01:54.630> things<00:01:55.049> are

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
because they're different things are

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.559 
because they're different things are
required<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.279> so<00:01:56.459> all<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.239> is<00:01:57.359> take

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
required of it so all you do is take

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.779 
required of it so all you do is take
this<00:01:57.749> push<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.739> and<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.279> see<00:01:59.459> this<00:01:59.609> green

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
this push it down and you see this green

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.459 
this push it down and you see this green
light<00:02:00.029> goes<00:02:00.239> on<00:02:00.389> you're<00:02:01.109> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.289> put<00:02:01.439> your

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
light goes on you're going to put your

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.809 
light goes on you're going to put your
ear<00:02:02.189> cup<00:02:02.459> under<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.499> push<00:02:04.499> that<00:02:04.819> now

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
ear cup under there and push that now

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:06.799 
ear cup under there and push that now
it's<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> make<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.359> couple<00:02:06.569> little

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:06.809 
it's going to make a couple little

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's going to make a couple little
clicking<00:02:07.229> sounds<00:02:07.709> as<00:02:07.859> it<00:02:08.340> goes<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.880> that's

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
clicking sounds as it goes and that's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.790 
clicking sounds as it goes and that's
the<00:02:09.509> pressure<00:02:09.780> building<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.440> machine

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the pressure building up in the machine

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.759 
the pressure building up in the machine
and<00:02:11.039> it'll<00:02:11.819> take<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> minute<00:02:12.269> or<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.900> you'll

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
it's not a lot because it is the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.070

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
like you might see in an Italian coffee

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.300 
like you might see in an Italian coffee
house<00:03:22.780> or<00:03:22.990> something<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:24.190> we're

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
house or something like that but we're

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.590 
house or something like that but we're
going<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.490> put<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.700> back<00:03:24.820> because<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.330> want<00:03:25.510> to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
going to put it back because we want to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.950 
going to put it back because we want to
do<00:03:25.690> our<00:03:25.810> second<00:03:26.170> step<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:28.390> froth

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
do our second step and that is the froth

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.530 
do our second step and that is the froth
milk<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.250> take<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.880> see<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.150> there's

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
milk so we take that see that there's

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.560 
milk so we take that see that there's
the<00:03:31.750> bar<00:03:32.170> code<00:03:32.410> again<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.030> where<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.360> you
