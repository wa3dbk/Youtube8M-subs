00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
we actually tucked it behind this white

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.230 
we actually tucked it behind this white
piece<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.429> tucked<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> up

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
piece right here and tucked it up

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
piece right here and tucked it up
between<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:55.350> bumper<00:01:55.530> cover<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.340> bumper

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
between the bumper cover and a bumper

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.059 
between the bumper cover and a bumper
structure<00:01:57.539> itself<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.229> mean<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:58.920> just

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
structure itself I mean then we just

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.770 
structure itself I mean then we just
continued<00:01:59.459> on<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> push<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.450> there<00:02:00.630> too

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
continued on and push it up in there too

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
continued on and push it up in there too
ran<00:02:00.959> all<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.289> way<00:02:01.380> across<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.280> gave<00:02:02.490> us

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
ran all the way across and that gave us

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.100 
ran all the way across and that gave us
just<00:02:02.880> enough<00:02:03.030> room<00:02:03.359> to<00:02:03.390> come<00:02:03.599> up<00:02:03.689> by<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.869> tail

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
just enough room to come up by the tail

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
just enough room to come up by the tail
light<00:02:07.160> this<00:02:08.160> point<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.640> ahead<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
light this point we can go ahead and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.319 
light this point we can go ahead and
zip-tie<00:02:09.539> our<00:02:09.810> wires<00:02:10.019> in<00:02:10.319> place<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.180> go<00:02:12.180> ahead

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
zip-tie our wires in place and go ahead

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.350 
zip-tie our wires in place and go ahead
and<00:02:12.510> reinstall<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.140> taillights<00:02:14.120> now<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.180> take

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and reinstall the taillights now we take

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.270 
and reinstall the taillights now we take
our<00:02:15.420> black<00:02:15.690> wire<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.200> start<00:02:16.739> running<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.160> up

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
our black wire and start running that up

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.729 
our black wire and start running that up
to<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> front<00:02:17.670> run<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.299> above<00:02:18.569> suspension<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
to the front run it above suspension and

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.650 
to the front run it above suspension and
along<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> frame<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> affirm<00:02:21.540> the

along the frame up to of affirm the
vehicle<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> battery<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.920> make<00:02:23.069> sure<00:02:23.099> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
vehicle to the battery but make sure you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.319 
vehicle to the battery but make sure you
stay<00:02:23.430> away<00:02:23.579> from<00:02:23.640> anything<00:02:23.910> that's<00:02:24.030> moving

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
stay away from anything that's moving

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.780 
stay away from anything that's moving
like<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.319> suspension<00:02:25.650> components<00:02:25.950> or

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
like the suspension components or

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.900 
like the suspension components or
anything<00:02:27.030> hot<00:02:27.329> like<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> exhaust<00:02:28.910> we

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
anything hot like the exhaust we

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.039 
anything hot like the exhaust we
wouldn't<00:02:30.090> take<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> wire<00:02:30.450> pulled<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.870> from<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
wouldn't take a wire pulled up from the

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.539 
wouldn't take a wire pulled up from the
bottom<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.440> eventually<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.040> run<00:02:32.190> into<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
bottom and eventually we run into the

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.420 
bottom and eventually we run into the
positive<00:02:33.150> side<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> battery<00:02:34.250> will<00:02:35.250> cut

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
positive side of the battery will cut

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.069 
positive side of the battery will cut
our<00:02:35.519> wire<00:02:35.639> length<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.420> then<00:02:36.569> add<00:02:36.750> our<00:02:36.900> fuse

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
our wire length and then add our fuse

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.900 
our wire length and then add our fuse
holder<00:02:37.440> we'll<00:02:37.920> take<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.100> few<00:02:38.340> solder<00:02:38.639> and<00:02:38.760> cut

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
holder we'll take a few solder and cut

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.789 
holder we'll take a few solder and cut
it<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.090> half<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:40.109> we'll<00:02:40.350> get<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.620> buck

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
it in half when we'll get the buck

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.960 
it in half when we'll get the buck
connector<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.549> other<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:41.760> we'll<00:02:41.850> get

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
connector and the other one we'll get

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.340 
connector and the other one we'll get
the<00:02:42.030> ring<00:02:42.180> terminal

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.780 

now<00:02:51.350> I'll<00:02:51.470> take<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> second<00:02:52.160> take<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:52.610> slack

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
now I'll take a second take the slack

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:01.450 
now I'll take a second take the slack
our<00:02:53.030> wires<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.660> zip<00:02:54.050> tie<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.260> into<00:02:54.410> place<00:03:00.460> all

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
our wires and zip tie it into place all

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.650 
our wires and zip tie it into place all
right<00:03:01.550> we'll<00:03:01.730> use<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.880> zip<00:03:02.120> tie<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.300> hold<00:03:02.450> our

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
right we'll use a zip tie to hold our

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.870 
right we'll use a zip tie to hold our
fuse<00:03:02.900> holder<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.290> place<00:03:03.700> then<00:03:04.700> we'll<00:03:04.790> go

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
fuse holder in place then we'll go

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.650 
fuse holder in place then we'll go
install<00:03:05.150> our<00:03:05.300> 10<00:03:05.630> amp<00:03:05.780> fuse<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:08.210> we<00:03:08.300> are<00:03:08.420> set

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
install our 10 amp fuse and we are set

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.210 
install our 10 amp fuse and we are set
all<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.110> gotta<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.500> test<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.830> out<00:03:09.980> with<00:03:10.100> a

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
all I gotta do is test it out with a

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.160 
all I gotta do is test it out with a
test<00:03:11.120> light<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:11.630> we<00:03:11.690> go<00:03:11.810> ahead<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.050> try

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
test light and then we go ahead and try

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.810 
test light and then we go ahead and try
it<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.350> trailer<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.890> with<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.790> will

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
it on a trailer and with that that will
