hi<00:00:07.230> guys<00:00:07.500> well<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.670> thought<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:09.809> I'd<00:00:09.930> do<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
hi guys well I thought today I'd do a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.020 
hi guys well I thought today I'd do a
little<00:00:10.380> bit<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.680> a<00:00:12.139> video<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.500> my<00:00:14.030> stitching

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
little bit of a video on my stitching

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.570 
little bit of a video on my stitching
pony<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.920> that<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.010> put<00:00:17.250> together<00:00:18.860> I<00:00:19.860> had<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
pony here that I put together I had a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.100 
pony here that I put together I had a
lot<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> interest<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.540> cam<00:00:21.810> mechanism

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
lot of interest in this cam mechanism

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.010 
lot of interest in this cam mechanism
here<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.070> let<00:00:23.790> me<00:00:23.850> go<00:00:24.000> ahead<00:00:24.030> and<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.720> out

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
here so let me go ahead and get this out

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.700 
here so let me go ahead and get this out
here

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.260 

okay<00:00:31.710> ler<00:00:31.890> guys<00:00:32.460> wanted<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.910> about<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
okay ler guys wanted to know about the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.639 
okay ler guys wanted to know about the
hardware<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> used<00:00:34.140> for<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> cam

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
hardware I used for the for the cam

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
hardware I used for the for the cam
mechanism<00:00:38.339> this<00:00:38.519> is<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.059> probably<00:00:40.050> two

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
mechanism this is just a probably two

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.459 
mechanism this is just a probably two
and<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.499> half<00:00:40.679> inch<00:00:40.949> screw<00:00:41.339> and<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.199> just<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
and a half inch screw and this is just a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.270 
and a half inch screw and this is just a
half<00:00:46.679> inch<00:00:47.690> piece<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> metal<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.409> hole<00:00:49.949> in

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
half inch piece of metal with a hole in

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
half inch piece of metal with a hole in
it<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:51.769> it's<00:00:52.769> threaded<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.519> I<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.179> it's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it and it's threaded with I think it's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.110 
it and it's threaded with I think it's
quarter<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:55.190> quarter<00:00:56.190> by<00:00:56.399> 20<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:56.940> something

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
quarter by quarter by 20 or something

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.779 
quarter by quarter by 20 or something
like<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.510> threads<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.339> actually<00:00:59.670> off

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
like that threads this is actually off

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.390 
like that threads this is actually off
of<00:00:59.819> a<00:01:00.059> baby<00:01:00.269> bed<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.640> tore<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> crib<00:01:03.300> apart<00:01:03.659> and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
of a baby bed I tore a crib apart and

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
of a baby bed I tore a crib apart and
this<00:01:05.400> hardware<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.360> holding<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this hardware was what was holding it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.000 
this hardware was what was holding it
together<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.320> where<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.620> would<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
together so where you would get this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
together so where you would get this
sort<00:01:08.550> of<00:01:08.640> thing<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.350> Lowe's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
sort of thing I really don't know Lowe's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.709 
sort of thing I really don't know Lowe's
Home<00:01:11.460> Improvement<00:01:11.579> Center<00:01:12.329> may<00:01:12.479> have

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
Home Improvement Center may have

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.870 
Home Improvement Center may have
something<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.829> that's<00:01:14.610> what

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
something like this but that's what

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.380 
something like this but that's what
actually<00:01:15.060> works<00:01:15.479> has<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.680> cam<00:01:17.390> mechanism

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
actually works has the cam mechanism

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.310 
actually works has the cam mechanism
inside<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:20.119> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> cam<00:01:22.549> and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
inside of here now this is the cam and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.279 
inside of here now this is the cam and
all<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> really<00:01:25.829> did<00:01:26.039> to<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.329> I'm

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
all I really did to make this was I'm

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.539 
all I really did to make this was I'm
not<00:01:28.500> sure<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> measurements<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
not sure what the measurements are this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.779 
not sure what the measurements are this
is<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.880> an<00:01:30.060> inch<00:01:30.240> wide<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
is about an inch wide here and this

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.980 
is about an inch wide here and this
comes<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.240> probably<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.930> half<00:01:34.289> an<00:01:34.530> inch<00:01:35.990> from

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
comes in probably a half an inch from

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.789 
comes in probably a half an inch from
the<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.310> hole<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.590> from<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the end down to this hole and from this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
the end down to this hole and from this
edge<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.640> probably<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.469> don't<00:01:43.469> know<00:01:43.649> three

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
edge in is probably I don't know three

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
edge in is probably I don't know three
fourths<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> an<00:01:44.490> inch<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.759> something<00:01:45.060> like

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
fourths of an inch or something like

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.139 
fourths of an inch or something like
that<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.829> I<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.100> rounded<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.609> over<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.060> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that and I just rounded it over here in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.469 
that and I just rounded it over here in
this<00:01:48.270> edge<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.579> applied<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.820> beeswax

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this edge and applied some beeswax

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.870 
this edge and applied some beeswax
that's<00:01:51.780> why<00:01:51.929> it's<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.200> shiny<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:53.009> put<00:01:53.729> some

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that's why it's so shiny I put some

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.870 
that's why it's so shiny I put some
beeswax<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> cam<00:01:55.649> nice<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
beeswax on here so that the cam nice and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.789 
beeswax on here so that the cam nice and
easy<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> pony

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
easy on the on the pony

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
easy on the on the pony
anyway<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.579> goes<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.999> here<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:04.170> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
anyway this just goes in here the way I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
anyway this just goes in here the way I
made<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.619> cam<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> had<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.520> math<00:02:05.700> questions

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
made this cam I had some math questions

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.499 
made this cam I had some math questions
about<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.190> way<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> made<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.789> cam<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.360> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
about that the way I made this cam was I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.420 
about that the way I made this cam was I
just<00:02:09.690> drilled<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.080> 5/16<00:02:10.950> inch<00:02:11.190> hole<00:02:11.460> in<00:02:12.230> here<00:02:13.430> at

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
just drilled a 5/16 inch hole in here at

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.610 
just drilled a 5/16 inch hole in here at
this<00:02:14.610> end<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.120> squared<00:02:15.540> down<00:02:15.840> off<00:02:16.230> that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
this end and then squared down off that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.640 
this end and then squared down off that
hole<00:02:16.920> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
hole and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.790 
hole and
cut<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.340> out<00:02:19.459> on<00:02:19.670> my<00:02:19.880> scroll<00:02:20.690> saw<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.590> shop

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
cut it out on my scroll saw in the shop

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440 
cut it out on my scroll saw in the shop
I<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.910> wish<00:02:23.030> I'd<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.300> done<00:02:23.330> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
I really wish I'd have done a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.840 
I really wish I'd have done a
construction<00:02:24.080> video<00:02:24.440> that's<00:02:24.740> how<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.920> made<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
construction video that's how I made the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.550 
construction video that's how I made the
shape<00:02:26.030> here<00:02:26.330> also<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.750> cut<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.440> my

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
shape here also I cut that out on my

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.100 
shape here also I cut that out on my
scroll<00:02:27.890> saw<00:02:28.060> probably<00:02:29.060> use<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.209> band<00:02:29.450> saw<00:02:29.630> or

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
scroll saw probably use a band saw or

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.160 
scroll saw probably use a band saw or
even<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.410> jigsaw<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.040> suppose<00:02:32.050> mm-hmm

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
even a jigsaw I suppose mm-hmm

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.130 
even a jigsaw I suppose mm-hmm
this<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.770> made<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.069> walnut<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.780> first<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.110> I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
this is made of walnut the first one I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.270 
this is made of walnut the first one I
made<00:02:36.380> was<00:02:36.680> made<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:37.100> cherry<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:39.440> split<00:02:40.160> out

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
made was made of cherry and it split out

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.160 
made was made of cherry and it split out
right<00:02:40.550> here<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.850> came<00:02:41.090> when<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.540> was<00:02:41.630> trying<00:02:41.930> to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
right here it came when I was trying to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.530 
right here it came when I was trying to
trying<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.980> use<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.000> walnuts<00:02:44.390> been

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
trying to use it so the walnuts been

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
trying to use it so the walnuts been
holding<00:02:44.870> up<00:02:44.989> pretty<00:02:45.170> well<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.380> actually

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
holding up pretty well this is actually

mahogany<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.810> made<00:02:50.810> these<00:02:51.019> pieces<00:02:51.260> out<00:02:51.560> of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
mahogany I made these pieces out of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.740 
mahogany I made these pieces out of
mahogany<00:02:51.880> there<00:02:52.880> again<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.150> measured<00:02:53.570> down

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
mahogany there again I measured down

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.340 
mahogany there again I measured down
here<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.050> think<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.500> don't<00:02:54.590> know<00:02:55.720> probably<00:02:56.720> 8

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
here I think I don't know probably 8

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.940 
here I think I don't know probably 8
inches<00:02:57.709> or<00:02:57.860> something<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:58.340> that

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
inches or something like that

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.710 
inches or something like that
don't<00:03:00.950> measured<00:03:01.760> down<00:03:01.910> probably<00:03:02.239> 8<00:03:02.390> inches

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
don't measured down probably 8 inches

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.479 
don't measured down probably 8 inches
from<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.110> end<00:03:03.350> or<00:03:03.680> maybe<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.069> measured<00:03:04.370> up

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
from this end or maybe I measured up

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.550 
from this end or maybe I measured up
this<00:03:04.640> rod<00:03:04.850> I'm<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.330> can't<00:03:05.600> remember<00:03:05.870> anymore

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
this rod I'm I can't remember anymore

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.229 
this rod I'm I can't remember anymore
I<00:03:06.590> wish<00:03:07.370> I'd<00:03:07.459> write<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> member<00:03:08.000> men

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
I wish I'd write the member men

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.259 
I wish I'd write the member men
measurements<00:03:08.840> down<00:03:08.989> but<00:03:09.850> inside<00:03:10.850> here<00:03:11.060> when<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
measurements down but inside here when I

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.090 
measurements down but inside here when I
ripped<00:03:11.480> these<00:03:11.630> boards<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> same<00:03:12.560> width<00:03:12.890> I

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
ripped these boards to the same width I

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.680 
ripped these boards to the same width I
had<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> little<00:03:13.519> piece<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.330> strip

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
had a little piece a little strip

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.460 
had a little piece a little strip
leftover<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.510> sort<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.660> added<00:03:17.989> those<00:03:18.170> in

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
leftover so I sort of added those in

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.759 
leftover so I sort of added those in
here<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:20.120> make<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.330> set<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.780> Jaws<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.350> grab<00:03:21.590> what

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
here to make a set of Jaws to grab what

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.319 
here to make a set of Jaws to grab what
I'm<00:03:21.890> working<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.850> seems<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.150> work<00:03:23.180> really

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
I'm working on it seems to work really

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.670 
I'm working on it seems to work really
well<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:23.989> leaves<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.290> little<00:03:24.470> extra

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
well and it leaves you a little extra

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.550 
well and it leaves you a little extra
room<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:25.130> here<00:03:25.250> for<00:03:25.459> your<00:03:25.579> project<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.120> sit<00:03:26.560> so

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
room in here for your project to sit so

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.140 
room in here for your project to sit so
naturally<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.489> course<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.820> have<00:03:29.030> your

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
naturally of course you have your

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.970 
naturally of course you have your
project<00:03:29.360> it's<00:03:29.780> thicker<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.350> leather<00:03:30.560> you're

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
project it's thicker and leather you're

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.220 
project it's thicker and leather you're
only<00:03:31.100> closing<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.269> know<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.750> allows

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
only closing it that you know it allows

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.270 
only closing it that you know it allows
extra<00:03:33.709> room<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.070> here<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.950> made<00:03:37.160> of

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
extra room in here so this is made of

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.979 
extra room in here so this is made of
cherry<00:03:37.549> that's<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.150> same<00:03:38.329> cherry<00:03:38.630> wood<00:03:38.870> that

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
cherry that's the same cherry wood that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.330 
cherry that's the same cherry wood that
I<00:03:39.079> made<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:43.340> first<00:03:44.329> came<00:03:44.630> out<00:03:44.900> of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
I made the the the first came out of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.150 
I made the the the first came out of
which<00:03:46.340> failed<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:47.690> was<00:03:48.590> trying<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.829> cut<00:03:49.010> some

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
which failed I was trying to cut some

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.849 
which failed I was trying to cut some
slots<00:03:49.459> in<00:03:49.640> here<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.910> make<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.709> when

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
slots in here to make this so that when

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.099 
slots in here to make this so that when
you<00:03:52.000> pinch<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.120> together<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.810> know<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
you pinch it together you know it

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.880 
you pinch it together you know it
wouldn't<00:03:54.609> spring<00:03:55.609> apart<00:03:55.970> in<00:03:56.180> there<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:56.660> know

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
wouldn't spring apart in there you know

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.770 
wouldn't spring apart in there you know
kind<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.980> give<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:58.310> relief<00:03:58.780> whether

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
kind of give it a little relief whether

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.330 
kind of give it a little relief whether
it<00:03:59.959> really<00:04:00.200> does<00:04:00.410> anything<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.920> don't<00:04:01.070> see<00:04:01.130> it

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
it really does anything I don't see it

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.670 
it really does anything I don't see it
moving<00:04:01.730> any<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.239> it's<00:04:02.989> pretty<00:04:03.260> hard<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.530> say

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
moving any so it's pretty hard to say

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.340 
moving any so it's pretty hard to say
whether<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:03.980> actually<00:04:04.459> works<00:04:04.730> or<00:04:04.910> not<00:04:05.350> I

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
whether that actually works or not I

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.910 
whether that actually works or not I
noticed<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.160> Tandy's<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.970> they<00:04:08.150> had<00:04:08.920> put

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
noticed on Tandy's that they had put

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.789 
noticed on Tandy's that they had put
some<00:04:10.160> some<00:04:10.670> kerfs<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.269> there<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.079> just<00:04:12.590> tried

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
some some kerfs in there so I just tried

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.860 
some some kerfs in there so I just tried
to<00:04:12.890> do<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.100> same<00:04:13.310> thing<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.660> probably

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
to do the same thing and it probably

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.900 
to do the same thing and it probably
would<00:04:15.170> work<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.530> as<00:04:15.709> well<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:16.430> know<00:04:16.579> whether

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
would work just as well you know whether

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.659 
would work just as well you know whether
I<00:04:17.030> did<00:04:17.180> or<00:04:17.329> didn't<00:04:17.720> have<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:19.220> then<00:04:19.400> down

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
I did or didn't have that and then down

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.270 
I did or didn't have that and then down
here<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.380> don't<00:04:21.380> know<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:21.890> see<00:04:22.100> or<00:04:22.250> not

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
here I don't know if you can see or not

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.360 
here I don't know if you can see or not
I<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:24.020> CH<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.320> in<00:04:24.560> probably<00:04:24.950> came<00:04:25.100> halfway

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
I not CH this in probably came halfway

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.010 
I not CH this in probably came halfway
through<00:04:25.729> this<00:04:25.880> boards<00:04:26.210> probably<00:04:26.570> half<00:04:26.750> inch

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
through this boards probably half inch

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.370 
through this boards probably half inch
thick<00:04:27.320> right<00:04:28.280> here<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.810> notched<00:04:30.110> in

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
thick right here and I notched in

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.129 
thick right here and I notched in
probably<00:04:30.979> quarter

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
probably quarter

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.809 
probably quarter
to<00:04:33.139> give<00:04:33.289> that<00:04:33.499> something<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.550> hold<00:04:34.699> it

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
to give that something to hold it

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.879 
to give that something to hold it
together<00:04:34.969> when<00:04:35.360> you're<00:04:35.539> springing<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.620> ends

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
together when you're springing the ends

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.890 
together when you're springing the ends
together<00:04:37.069> seventh<00:04:37.639> it<00:04:37.729> doesn't<00:04:38.090> fly<00:04:38.300> apart<00:04:38.659> on

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
together seventh it doesn't fly apart on

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.959 
together seventh it doesn't fly apart on
you<00:04:39.050> kind<00:04:39.919> of<00:04:40.039> helps<00:04:40.279> to<00:04:40.310> hold<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.729> and

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
you kind of helps to hold that and

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.820 
you kind of helps to hold that and
there's<00:04:41.300> no<00:04:41.449> glue<00:04:41.749> in<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.080> at<00:04:42.259> all<00:04:42.379> so<00:04:42.680> it's

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
there's no glue in this at all so it's

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.080 
there's no glue in this at all so it's
just<00:04:42.919> held<00:04:43.189> together<00:04:43.310> by<00:04:44.379> I<00:04:45.639> think<00:04:46.639> inch<00:04:46.909> and<00:04:47.060> a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
just held together by I think inch and a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.170 
just held together by I think inch and a
half<00:04:47.560> or<00:04:48.560> inch<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:49.009> quarter<00:04:49.189> stainless

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
half or inch and a quarter stainless

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.600 
half or inch and a quarter stainless
steel<00:04:50.360> deck<00:04:50.629> screws<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.289> broke<00:04:51.979> one<00:04:52.159> off<00:04:52.370> here

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
steel deck screws I broke one off here

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.909 
steel deck screws I broke one off here
so<00:04:52.819> that's<00:04:52.969> why<00:04:53.120> there's<00:04:53.330> two<00:04:53.389> there<00:04:53.919> nothing

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
so that's why there's two there nothing

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.830 
so that's why there's two there nothing
fancy<00:04:55.069> if<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.699> hadn't<00:04:55.999> snapped<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.389> one<00:04:56.629> off

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
fancy if I hadn't snapped that one off

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.540 
fancy if I hadn't snapped that one off
there<00:04:57.020> would<00:04:57.110> only<00:04:57.199> be<00:04:57.349> two<00:04:57.439> and<00:04:58.219> then<00:04:58.370> on<00:04:58.460> the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
there would only be two and then on the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.330 
there would only be two and then on the
bottom<00:04:58.699> I<00:04:59.650> scrolled<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.770> just<00:05:01.039> screwed<00:05:01.249> up

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
bottom I scrolled it just screwed up

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.100 
bottom I scrolled it just screwed up
into<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.699> center<00:05:01.909> that's<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.539> same<00:05:02.810> deck

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
into the center that's the same deck

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.990 
into the center that's the same deck
screws<00:05:03.469> I<00:05:03.680> just<00:05:03.889> screwed<00:05:04.129> up<00:05:04.219> into<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.639> center

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
screws I just screwed up into the center

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.519 
screws I just screwed up into the center
of<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:06.099> cherry<00:05:07.099> block<00:05:07.430> there<00:05:07.789> and<00:05:08.529> that's

of the cherry block there and that's

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.580 
of the cherry block there and that's

look<00:05:26.569> at<00:05:26.689> that<00:05:26.719> cam<00:05:27.169> it's<00:05:27.529> really<00:05:27.919> nothing

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
look at that cam it's really nothing

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.749 
look at that cam it's really nothing
special<00:05:28.629> probably<00:05:29.629> I<00:05:30.129> don't<00:05:31.129> know<00:05:31.219> five<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.729> a

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
special probably I don't know five and a

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.589 
special probably I don't know five and a
half<00:05:31.819> six<00:05:32.150> inches<00:05:32.419> long<00:05:33.189> I'm<00:05:34.189> guessing<00:05:34.669> this

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
half six inches long I'm guessing this

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.490 
half six inches long I'm guessing this
is<00:05:35.659> a<00:05:36.430> in<00:05:37.430> my<00:05:37.759> drill<00:05:38.000> bit<00:05:38.180> set<00:05:38.419> there's<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:39.050> drill

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
is a in my drill bit set there's a drill

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.879 
is a in my drill bit set there's a drill
bit<00:05:39.650> above<00:05:40.009> this<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:41.229> half-inch<00:05:42.229> size<00:05:42.469> I

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
bit above this the half-inch size I

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.679 
bit above this the half-inch size I
don't<00:05:43.159> remember<00:05:43.430> exactly<00:05:43.669> what<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.300> but

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689 
don't remember exactly what it is but

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.200 
don't remember exactly what it is but
that's<00:05:44.779> what<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:45.020> use<00:05:45.229> so<00:05:45.500> that<00:05:45.680> this<00:05:45.770> would<00:05:46.210> you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
that's what I use so that this would you

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.540 
that's what I use so that this would you
know<00:05:47.300> fit<00:05:47.569> in<00:05:47.689> there<00:05:47.870> real<00:05:48.110> easy<00:05:48.349> and<00:05:48.710> then

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
know fit in there real easy and then

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.010 
know fit in there real easy and then
this<00:05:49.669> just<00:05:49.849> sits<00:05:50.089> in<00:05:50.180> here<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:50.509> it<00:05:50.569> toggles

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
this just sits in here and it toggles

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.490 
this just sits in here and it toggles
through<00:05:52.389> you<00:05:53.389> know<00:05:53.509> through<00:05:53.539> that<00:05:53.899> slot<00:05:54.259> that

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
through you know through that slot that

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.100 
through you know through that slot that
you've<00:05:54.649> made<00:05:54.889> here<00:05:55.250> a<00:05:55.509> slot<00:05:56.509> I<00:05:56.539> brought<00:05:56.899> down

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
you've made here a slot I brought down

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.110 
you've made here a slot I brought down
actually<00:05:57.379> a<00:05:57.770> good<00:05:58.099> bit<00:05:58.250> below<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.580> probably<00:05:58.969> not

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
actually a good bit below I probably not

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.350 
actually a good bit below I probably not
to<00:05:59.210> go<00:05:59.330> quite<00:05:59.659> that<00:05:59.689> far<00:05:59.870> because<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:02.120> thing

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
to go quite that far because the thing

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.959 
to go quite that far because the thing
actually<00:06:02.539> stops<00:06:03.139> at<00:06:03.439> 90<00:06:03.860> degrees<00:06:04.250> so<00:06:04.699> I

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
actually stops at 90 degrees so I

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.610 
actually stops at 90 degrees so I
probably<00:06:05.210> got<00:06:05.389> the<00:06:05.539> slot<00:06:05.810> a<00:06:05.870> good<00:06:06.110> bit<00:06:06.259> deeper

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
probably got the slot a good bit deeper

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.409 
probably got the slot a good bit deeper
than<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:06.860> needed<00:06:07.099> I<00:06:07.430> just<00:06:07.819> wanted<00:06:08.149> to<00:06:08.240> make<00:06:08.360> sure

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
than I needed I just wanted to make sure

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.230 
than I needed I just wanted to make sure
that<00:06:08.870> I<00:06:08.899> had<00:06:09.139> room<00:06:09.490> that's<00:06:10.490> all<00:06:10.699> that's<00:06:11.060> all

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
that I had room that's all that's all

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.920 
that I had room that's all that's all
that's<00:06:11.419> for<00:06:11.750> but<00:06:13.360> it's<00:06:14.360> been<00:06:14.509> a<00:06:14.539> pretty<00:06:14.779> good

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
that's for but it's been a pretty good

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.110 
that's for but it's been a pretty good
design<00:06:15.289> and<00:06:15.529> it's<00:06:16.069> a<00:06:16.129> whole<00:06:16.279> lot<00:06:16.310> easier<00:06:16.849> than

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
design and it's a whole lot easier than

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.649 
design and it's a whole lot easier than
a<00:06:17.529> whole<00:06:18.529> lot<00:06:18.710> easier<00:06:19.099> I<00:06:19.129> think<00:06:19.219> than<00:06:20.000> messing

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
a whole lot easier I think than messing

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.490 
a whole lot easier I think than messing
with<00:06:20.689> a<00:06:20.919> stupid<00:06:21.919> wingnut<00:06:22.460> on<00:06:22.639> here<00:06:22.909> that<00:06:23.500> Tandy

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
with a stupid wingnut on here that Tandy

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.860 
with a stupid wingnut on here that Tandy
has<00:06:24.680> on<00:06:24.889> there's<00:06:25.129> you<00:06:26.029> know<00:06:26.060> not<00:06:26.389> to<00:06:26.569> take

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
has on there's you know not to take

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.679

anything<00:06:27.080> away<00:06:27.289> from<00:06:27.409> Tandy<00:06:28.039> but<00:06:28.569> you<00:06:29.569> know

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
anything away from Tandy but you know

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.309 
anything away from Tandy but you know
they're<00:06:30.080> pretty<00:06:31.089> good<00:06:32.089> company<00:06:32.599> all<00:06:33.110> these

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
they're pretty good company all these

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.770 
they're pretty good company all these
holes<00:06:33.589> in<00:06:33.830> here<00:06:34.779> and<00:06:35.779> were<00:06:35.960> either<00:06:36.080> 5/16<00:06:36.889> or

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
holes in here and were either 5/16 or

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.420 
holes in here and were either 5/16 or
somewhere<00:06:38.780> close<00:06:38.960> to<00:06:39.080> 5/16<00:06:39.890> of<00:06:40.010> an<00:06:40.070> inch<00:06:40.280> I

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
somewhere close to 5/16 of an inch I

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.390 
somewhere close to 5/16 of an inch I
think<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:41.080> of<00:06:42.080> course<00:06:42.110> this<00:06:42.470> thing<00:06:42.500> how<00:06:43.190> this

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
think and of course this thing how this

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.230 
think and of course this thing how this
works<00:06:43.640> is<00:06:44.140> you<00:06:45.140> know<00:06:45.230> they<00:06:46.130> just<00:06:46.340> thread<00:06:47.120> this

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
works is you know they just thread this

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.650 
works is you know they just thread this
on<00:06:47.450> here<00:06:47.780> and<00:06:48.940> when<00:06:49.940> you<00:06:50.030> get<00:06:50.120> where<00:06:50.330> you<00:06:50.420> want

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
on here and when you get where you want

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.720 
on here and when you get where you want
it<00:06:50.980> depending<00:06:51.980> on<00:06:52.070> the<00:06:52.190> thickness<00:06:52.310> of<00:06:52.610> your

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
it depending on the thickness of your

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.640 
it depending on the thickness of your
project<00:06:53.270> you<00:06:53.390> really<00:06:53.630> don't<00:06:53.780> need<00:06:53.900> it<00:06:54.050> it's

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
project you really don't need it it's

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.290 
project you really don't need it it's
not<00:06:54.800> meant<00:06:54.980> to<00:06:55.010> clamp<00:06:55.460> that<00:06:55.580> leather<00:06:55.970> you<00:06:56.270> know

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.210 
not meant to clamp that leather you know
like<00:06:56.570> a<00:06:56.600> glue<00:06:57.020> clamp<00:06:57.260> or<00:06:57.620> something<00:06:57.920> like<00:06:58.070> that

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
like a glue clamp or something like that

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.530 
like a glue clamp or something like that
it's<00:06:58.370> just<00:06:58.400> meant<00:06:58.640> to<00:06:58.760> hold<00:06:58.970> it<00:06:59.210> while<00:06:59.360> you're

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
it's just meant to hold it while you're

it's just meant to hold it while you're
doing<00:07:00.170> your<00:07:00.200> stitching<00:07:00.770> now<00:07:01.430> you<00:07:01.490> sit<00:07:01.850> your

watching this already knew how to work
of<00:07:07.040> stitching<00:07:07.400> Pony<00:07:07.640> but<00:07:07.910> when<00:07:08.630> you

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720

comes in handy you just pop the km up
and<00:07:13.970> you<00:07:14.810> know<00:07:14.960> and<00:07:15.670> if<00:07:16.670> it's<00:07:16.760> not<00:07:17.000> tight

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
and you know and if it's not tight

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.550 
and you know and if it's not tight
enough<00:07:17.510> you<00:07:17.750> know<00:07:17.870> you<00:07:17.930> just<00:07:18.140> kind<00:07:18.380> of<00:07:18.410> hold

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
enough you know you just kind of hold

your finger on this over here and you

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.280 
your finger on this over here and you
can<00:07:19.820> twist<00:07:20.120> this<00:07:20.360> till<00:07:20.540> it<00:07:20.630> gets<00:07:20.780> you<00:07:21.260> know

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
can twist this till it gets you know

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.380 
can twist this till it gets you know
where<00:07:21.590> you<00:07:21.710> it's<00:07:22.550> tight<00:07:22.790> enough<00:07:23.060> to<00:07:23.210> hold

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.390 
where you it's tight enough to hold

where you it's tight enough to hold
whatever<00:07:23.630> you're<00:07:23.900> trying<00:07:24.620> to<00:07:24.770> clamp<00:07:25.010> in<00:07:25.280> there

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
whatever you're trying to clamp in there

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.770 
whatever you're trying to clamp in there
but<00:07:26.470> it<00:07:27.470> works<00:07:27.680> really<00:07:27.890> well<00:07:28.570> then<00:07:29.570> what<00:07:29.690> I'm

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
but it works really well then what I'm

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.240 
but it works really well then what I'm
not<00:07:29.930> using<00:07:30.170> I<00:07:30.380> just<00:07:30.620> loosen<00:07:30.890> it<00:07:30.920> up<00:07:31.040> to<00:07:31.160> the

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
not using I just loosen it up to the

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.530 
not using I just loosen it up to the
point<00:07:31.490> where<00:07:31.670> I<00:07:31.700> can<00:07:31.940> flop<00:07:32.540> it<00:07:32.720> down<00:07:32.870> here<00:07:33.200> and

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540 
point where I can flop it down here and

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.570 
point where I can flop it down here and
just<00:07:35.540> kind<00:07:35.840> of<00:07:35.870> let<00:07:36.020> that<00:07:36.170> hang<00:07:36.380> there<00:07:36.580> takes

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 
just kind of let that hang there takes

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.400 
just kind of let that hang there takes
all<00:07:37.730> the<00:07:37.850> stress<00:07:37.880> off<00:07:38.360> of<00:07:38.390> everything<00:07:39.020> and

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.410 
all the stress off of everything and

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.400 
all the stress off of everything and
just<00:07:39.860> to<00:07:40.610> store<00:07:40.880> it<00:07:41.030> when<00:07:41.180> I'm<00:07:41.270> not<00:07:41.420> using<00:07:41.690> like

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.410 
just to store it when I'm not using like

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.770
