security section of Bell Savas so I'm

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.779 
security section of Bell Savas so I'm
going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:15.990> starting<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.430> the<00:00:17.430> actual

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
going to be starting here the actual

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.550 
going to be starting here the actual
data<00:00:17.970> crown<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> back<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> very<00:00:19.410> back

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
data crown is back here in the very back

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
data crown is back here in the very back
of<00:00:19.619> there's<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> lava<00:00:20.070> pit<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.270> we're<00:00:21.420> gonna

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
of there's a lava pit so we're gonna

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.849 
of there's a lava pit so we're gonna
head<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.960> path<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.500> then<00:00:22.619> we're<00:00:22.740> going

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
head on this path and then we're going

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.109 
head on this path and then we're going
to<00:00:22.920> take<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> little<00:00:23.310> shortcut<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.939> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
to take a little shortcut up this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
to take a little shortcut up this
direction<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.289> will<00:00:25.619> show<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> exactly

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
direction and I will show you exactly

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
direction and I will show you exactly
where<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:35.899> there<00:00:36.899> are<00:00:36.989> actually<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
where that is so there are actually a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.260 
where that is so there are actually a
few<00:00:37.469> ways<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.879> follow<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
few ways to get here you can follow the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.810 
few ways to get here you can follow the
path<00:00:39.450> down<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.890> will<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> both

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
path down and then I will show you both

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
path down and then I will show you both
entrances<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> way<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
entrances but this is the way that I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.639 
entrances but this is the way that I
think<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.760> easiest<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
think is the easiest way to get to it so

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
think is the easiest way to get to it so
from<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.280> would<00:00:47.520> turn<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:47.969> into

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
from here you just would turn right into

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
from here you just would turn right into
here<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.600> where<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> lab<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> right

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
here so where we are in the lab is right

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
here so where we are in the lab is right
up<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.420> came<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.289> just

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
up here so we came down here and just

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
up here so we came down here and just
kind<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> cut<00:00:53.010> across<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.090> on

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
kind of cut across this right here on

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
kind of cut across this right here on
the<00:00:54.780> snow<00:00:54.989> bank<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.440> our<00:00:55.829> gonna<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.129> through

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the snow bank and our gonna go through

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
the snow bank and our gonna go through
here<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
here but you can also come from this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.560 
here but you can also come from this
direction<00:00:57.890> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> follow<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> path<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.390> can

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
direction if you follow the path you can

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.880 
direction if you follow the path you can
come<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.870> around<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.379> there's<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> little

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
come up around here and there's a little

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
come up around here and there's a little
gate<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.329> direction<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
gate way up that direction but if you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.490 
gate way up that direction but if you
come<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.610> easier

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
come the other way it's a little easier

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.760 
come the other way it's a little easier
so<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.770> follow<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.340> cave<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.770> simply

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
so you just follow this cave and simply

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.370 
so you just follow this cave and simply
follow<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> path<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.479> too<00:01:12.869> hard

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
follow the path it's not really too hard

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.640 
follow the path it's not really too hard
to<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.980 

now<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.150> presents<00:01:24.540> plus<00:01:24.750> for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
now you have it your presents plus for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and you can get out through this top way

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510
