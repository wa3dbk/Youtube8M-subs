our youth is not passed and why the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.399 
our youth is not passed and why the
school<00:02:02.280> has<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> Lord<00:02:03.000> tape<00:02:03.360> test<00:02:03.840> scores<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
those kids nine days and in the waters

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.700
