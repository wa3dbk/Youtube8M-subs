the stick and he's using a Blue Max
squeegee<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.840> newer<00:01:37.140> tool

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
squeegee this is actually a newer tool

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.380 
squeegee this is actually a newer tool
for<00:01:37.829> when<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.070> first<00:01:38.310> start<00:01:38.610> attending<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
for when we first start attending this

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
for when we first start attending this
actually<00:01:39.810> makes<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> easier<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:40.710> apply

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
actually makes it easier you can apply

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
actually makes it easier you can apply
more<00:01:41.280> pressure<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.970> gives<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> cleaner

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
more pressure and it gives you a cleaner

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.200 
more pressure and it gives you a cleaner
pull<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> squeegee<00:01:43.729> after<00:01:44.729> using<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
pull of the squeegee after using that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.050 
pull of the squeegee after using that
squeegee<00:01:45.710> he<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:46.920> uses<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:49.970> blue<00:01:50.970> paper<00:01:51.210> towel
