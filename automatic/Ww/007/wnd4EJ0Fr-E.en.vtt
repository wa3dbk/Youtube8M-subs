how to create this right here it's a

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.600 
how to create this right here it's a
bathroom<00:00:05.420> linoleum<00:00:06.420> or<00:00:06.919> vinyl

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610

bathroom linoleum or vinyl
you<00:00:09.000> know<00:00:09.090> tiles<00:00:09.559> they're<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.710> actual<00:00:11.099> tires

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
you know tiles they're not actual tires

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.180 
you know tiles they're not actual tires
top<00:00:11.849> tiles<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.540> they<00:00:12.690> come<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.380> now<00:00:14.130> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
top tiles but they come and like now you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.799 
top tiles but they come and like now you
roll<00:00:14.460> them<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.150> paste<00:00:15.420> them<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
roll them out then you paste them on the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.590 
roll them out then you paste them on the
floor<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.199> stuff<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.680> know<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> cheap<00:00:17.100> version

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
floor and stuff you know a cheap version

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.429 
floor and stuff you know a cheap version
so<00:00:19.160> it's<00:00:20.160> using<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.270> procedural<00:00:21.840> textures

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so it's using just procedural textures

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.000 
so it's using just procedural textures
it's<00:00:23.869> using<00:00:24.869> an<00:00:24.960> array<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.230> course<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.830> made

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it's using an array of course I made

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.920 
it's using an array of course I made
this<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.210> right<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.750> did

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.419 
this and you can see right here we did
some<00:00:28.080> normals<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> make<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.189> wavy

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429

alright we can tap out now and let's go
under<00:01:09.780> modifiers<00:01:10.439> let's<00:01:10.890> add<00:01:11.070> an<00:01:11.189> array

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
under modifiers let's add an array

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
under modifiers let's add an array
modifier<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.930> need<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> change

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
modifier and we don't need to change

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.780 
modifier and we don't need to change
anything<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.340> add<00:01:14.490> another

anything so we can just add another

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
anything so we can just add another
modifier<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:19.430> instead<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
modifier but on this one instead of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.109 
modifier but on this one instead of
being<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> X<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.000> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
being the one on the X gonna be one on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.460 
being the one on the X gonna be one on
the<00:01:24.210> Y<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.170> go

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the Y there we go

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
the Y there we go
and<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.250> course<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.729> you're<00:01:26.820> gonna<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:27.030> this

and of course if you're gonna use this

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
and of course if you're gonna use this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
for scene you want to expand that number

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210 
for scene you want to expand that number
by<00:01:29.640> increasing<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> count<00:01:30.650> but<00:01:31.650> since<00:01:32.009> I'm

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
by increasing the count but since I'm

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.410 
by increasing the count but since I'm
just<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.820> want<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> teach<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> how

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
can get started on our textures if I can

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.390 
can get started on our textures if I can
grab<00:01:59.700> my<00:01:59.729> camera

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:16.100 

so<00:02:08.400> I<00:02:08.460> move<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.119> bit<00:02:13.370> all<00:02:14.370> right<00:02:15.110> all

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
all right let's right-click on our tiles

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.320 
all right let's right-click on our tiles
under<00:02:25.830> material<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.640> let's<00:02:26.790> add<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.300> new

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
under material so let's add a new

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.950 
under material so let's add a new
material<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.590> name<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:28.800> tile<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.960> I'm

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
material and name that tile and I'm

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.240 
material and name that tile and I'm
going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> give<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.800> slight<00:02:32.670> yellowish<00:02:33.150> look

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
on the outer edges of our tile because

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.350 
on the outer edges of our tile because
we<00:03:11.100> don't<00:03:11.280> want<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.730> be<00:03:11.820> affected<00:03:12.209> by<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
we don't want that to be affected by the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.940 
we don't want that to be affected by the
texture<00:03:12.840> set<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.230> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:13.800> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
texture set it's going to be like the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.190 
texture set it's going to be like the
mortar<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.520> caulking<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.840> know<00:03:15.959> it's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
mortar the caulking that you know it's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.000 
mortar the caulking that you know it's
just<00:03:16.350> white<00:03:16.709> no<00:03:17.450> will<00:03:18.450> some<00:03:19.010> irregularities

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
just white no will some irregularities

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.990 
just white no will some irregularities
but<00:03:20.220> we're<00:03:20.340> not<00:03:20.459> going<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:20.730> into<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
but we're not going to go into that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.570 
but we're not going to go into that
right<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:22.200> let's<00:03:22.530> click<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:22.920> border<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
right now so let's click on border and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.960 
right now so let's click on border and
then<00:03:23.910> click<00:03:24.180> assign<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:25.830> now<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
then click assign and as you see now the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.190 
then click assign and as you see now the
edges<00:03:27.450> are<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.050> white<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.940> let's<00:03:30.630> go

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
edges are now white and so let's go

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.370 
edges are now white and so let's go
click<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.800> our<00:03:32.280> tile<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.910> click<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:33.959> textures

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
click on our tile and click on textures

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.280 
click on our tile and click on textures
so<00:03:35.100> now<00:03:35.220> anything<00:03:35.670> we<00:03:35.790> make<00:03:36.000> any<00:03:36.330> textures<00:03:37.110> we

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
so now anything we make any textures we

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.650 
so now anything we make any textures we
add<00:03:37.470> they<00:03:38.070> will<00:03:38.220> only<00:03:38.370> affect<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.970> tiles<00:03:39.269> and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
add they will only affect the tiles and

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
add they will only affect the tiles and
not<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.230> border<00:03:40.830> since<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.580> has<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> different

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
not the border since it has a different

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.720 
not the border since it has a different
material<00:03:42.260> new<00:03:43.260> texture<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.550> going<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
material new texture and it's going to

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.750 
material new texture and it's going to
be<00:03:44.850> clouds<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:47.489> going<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.640> be<00:03:47.730> a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
be clouds and this is just going to be a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.320 
be clouds and this is just going to be a
color<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.750> let's<00:03:49.190> leave<00:03:50.190> color<00:03:50.489> as<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
color so let's leave color as it is and

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.240 
color so let's leave color as it is and
I<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.050> want<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.230> change<00:03:52.500> some<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.010> cloud

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
I just want to change some of the cloud

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.600 
I just want to change some of the cloud
settings<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:54.060> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.300> be<00:03:54.739> hard<00:03:55.739> noise<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
settings it's going to be hard noise and

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.300 
settings it's going to be hard noise and
we're<00:03:57.450> going<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.630> increase<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.470> size<00:03:58.709> so

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
we're going to increase the size so

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.150 
we're going to increase the size so
there's<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.910> less<00:04:00.300> noise<00:04:00.630> let's<00:04:01.590> click<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:01.950> both

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
there's a less noise let's click on both

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.770 
there's a less noise let's click on both
actually<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:02.850> we<00:04:02.940> can<00:04:03.060> see<00:04:03.209> what's<00:04:03.390> happening

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
actually so we can see what's happening

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.240 
actually so we can see what's happening
with<00:04:03.900> our<00:04:04.170> material<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:06.739> just<00:04:07.739> like<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> circle

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
with our material I just like a circle

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.160 
with our material I just like a circle
better<00:04:08.400> all<00:04:09.239> right<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.690> now<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:10.050> were<00:04:10.140> to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
better all right so now if we were to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.309 
better all right so now if we were to
render<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.880> it's<00:04:11.880> purple<00:04:12.300> because<00:04:12.990> under

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
render this it's purple because under

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.770 
render this it's purple because under
influence<00:04:13.680> we<00:04:14.520> have<00:04:14.610> color<00:04:14.940> selected<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
influence we have color selected in the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.879 
influence we have color selected in the
default<00:04:16.140> color<00:04:16.350> is

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
default color is

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.029 
default color is
purple<00:04:17.669> or<00:04:17.909> magenta<00:04:17.940> or<00:04:18.659> whatever<00:04:19.049> all<00:04:19.979> right

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
purple or magenta or whatever all right

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.070 
purple or magenta or whatever all right
so<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.430> we<00:04:20.489> can<00:04:20.759> change<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.239> color<00:04:21.479> to

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.809 

slightly<00:04:25.080> yellowish<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.979> we're<00:04:26.430> under<00:04:26.669> that

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
slightly yellowish and we're under that

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.700 
slightly yellowish and we're under that
f12<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.720> now<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.710> can<00:04:28.979> see<00:04:29.449> CLO<00:04:30.449> ish<00:04:30.710> maybe

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
f12 and now you can see CLO ish maybe

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:43.100 
f12 and now you can see CLO ish maybe
too<00:04:32.039> much<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:37.879> 12c<00:04:40.310> let's<00:04:41.310> have<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.330> white<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
too much of 12c let's have it white and

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.529 
too much of 12c let's have it white and
maybe<00:04:43.379> a<00:04:43.500> darker<00:04:44.009> white<00:04:46.610> f12<00:04:47.610> up<00:04:47.940> can't<00:04:48.389> really

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
maybe a darker white f12 up can't really

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.839 
maybe a darker white f12 up can't really
see<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.840> as<00:04:48.930> well<00:04:49.139> behind<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.849> regular

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
see that as well behind the regular

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.320 
see that as well behind the regular
material<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.830> I'm<00:04:53.550> just<00:04:53.909> gonna<00:04:54.060> make<00:04:54.150> this

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
material so I'm just gonna make this

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.409 
material so I'm just gonna make this
stronger<00:04:54.800> just<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.580> guys<00:04:56.819> can<00:04:56.940> benefit

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
stronger just so you guys can benefit

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.529 
stronger just so you guys can benefit
and<00:04:57.599> see<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:57.960> from<00:04:58.110> your<00:04:58.169> computer<00:04:58.409> screen<00:04:58.979> and

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
and see it from your computer screen and

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.089 
and see it from your computer screen and
you<00:05:00.539> know<00:05:00.659> the<00:05:00.750> problem<00:05:01.139> is<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.530> probably<00:05:01.770> made

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
you know the problem is I probably made

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:08.450 
you know the problem is I probably made
the<00:05:02.250> material<00:05:02.569> too<00:05:03.569> strong<00:05:06.830> alright<00:05:07.830> there<00:05:08.430> we

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
the material too strong alright there we

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.379 
the material too strong alright there we
go<00:05:08.699> now<00:05:08.879> you<00:05:08.940> can<00:05:09.150> see<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.389> better<00:05:10.490> go<00:05:11.490> back<00:05:12.259> and

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
go now you can see it better go back and

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.369 
go now you can see it better go back and
that's<00:05:15.389> all<00:05:15.599> the<00:05:15.719> settings<00:05:16.050> we<00:05:16.169> want<00:05:16.319> to

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
that's all the settings we want to

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.770 
that's all the settings we want to
change<00:05:16.590> let's<00:05:17.430> click<00:05:17.729> on<00:05:17.879> a<00:05:17.909> new<00:05:18.120> empty<00:05:18.389> slot

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
change let's click on a new empty slot

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.659 
change let's click on a new empty slot
add<00:05:19.050> new<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.830> let's<00:05:20.280> name<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.729> one<00:05:22.250> CLL<00:05:23.279> for

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
add new and let's name this one CLL for

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.719 
add new and let's name this one CLL for
color<00:05:23.909> and<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:25.289> set<00:05:25.529> the<00:05:25.800> cloud<00:05:26.159> settings<00:05:26.550> are

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
color and the set the cloud settings are

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:27.800 
color and the set the cloud settings are
going<00:05:26.819> to<00:05:26.909> stay<00:05:27.090> as<00:05:27.210> they<00:05:27.360> are<00:05:27.389> we're<00:05:27.779> just

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
going to stay as they are we're just

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.089 
going to stay as they are we're just
going<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.080> change<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.440> color<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:30.349> again<00:05:31.349> yes

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
going to change the color and again yes

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.129 
going to change the color and again yes
any<00:05:35.099> color<00:05:35.759> f12<00:05:36.449> and<00:05:36.599> now<00:05:36.719> you<00:05:36.810> can<00:05:36.930> see<00:05:37.110> a

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
any color f12 and now you can see a

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.589 
any color f12 and now you can see a
variation<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.949> color<00:05:38.190> now<00:05:39.029> the<00:05:39.090> reason<00:05:39.569> that

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
variation of color now the reason that

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.360 
variation of color now the reason that
we<00:05:39.930> didn't<00:05:40.199> change<00:05:40.409> this<00:05:40.590> one<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.889> hard<00:05:41.099> cloud

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
we didn't change this one to hard cloud

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.860 
we didn't change this one to hard cloud
is<00:05:41.759> because<00:05:42.949> the<00:05:43.949> textures<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:45.150> texture<00:05:45.599> this

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
is because the textures the texture this

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.420 
is because the textures the texture this
has<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.409> color<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.889> only<00:05:47.099> going<00:05:47.279> to<00:05:47.340> affect

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
has the color is only going to affect

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.469 
has the color is only going to affect
that<00:05:47.729> texture<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.449> if<00:05:49.440> this<00:05:50.190> color<00:05:50.940> texture

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
that texture and if this color texture

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.959 
that texture and if this color texture
that<00:05:51.599> this<00:05:51.979> texture<00:05:52.979> that<00:05:53.069> we<00:05:53.190> need<00:05:53.310> color<00:05:53.669> it

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
that this texture that we need color it

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.769 
that this texture that we need color it
has<00:05:54.569> a<00:05:54.870> different<00:05:55.349> texture<00:05:55.979> than<00:05:56.129> the<00:05:56.779> first

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
has a different texture than the first

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.600 
has a different texture than the first
one<00:05:58.020> so<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.740> color<00:05:58.949> is<00:05:59.069> going<00:05:59.250> to<00:05:59.340> affect

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
one so the color is going to affect

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.490 
one so the color is going to affect
different<00:05:59.759> spots<00:06:00.210> giving<00:06:00.599> it<00:06:00.690> more<00:06:00.840> variation

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
different spots giving it more variation

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.409 
different spots giving it more variation
I<00:06:01.740> don't<00:06:02.460> know<00:06:02.520> if<00:06:02.580> I'm<00:06:02.669> making<00:06:02.819> myself<00:06:03.060> clear

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
I don't know if I'm making myself clear

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.899 
I don't know if I'm making myself clear
but<00:06:03.690> that's<00:06:03.840> just<00:06:04.199> basically<00:06:05.069> why<00:06:05.669> we're

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
but that's just basically why we're

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.279 
but that's just basically why we're
going<00:06:06.029> to<00:06:06.090> do<00:06:06.240> it<00:06:07.729> okay<00:06:08.729> and<00:06:09.000> let's<00:06:09.960> add

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
going to do it okay and let's add

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.040 
going to do it okay and let's add
another<00:06:10.620> slot<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:12.080> the<00:06:13.080> Flex<00:06:13.379> color<00:06:13.740> and

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
another slot and the Flex color and

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.279 
another slot and the Flex color and
select<00:06:16.050> stencil<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.569> stencil<00:06:18.569> is<00:06:18.779> basically

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
select stencil and stencil is basically

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.969 
select stencil and stencil is basically
a<00:06:19.680> mask<00:06:20.629> the<00:06:21.629> textures<00:06:22.169> that<00:06:22.319> are<00:06:22.500> under<00:06:22.830> this

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
a mask the textures that are under this

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.159 
a mask the textures that are under this
are<00:06:23.340> only<00:06:23.550> going<00:06:23.729> to<00:06:23.819> be<00:06:23.940> affected<00:06:24.419> by<00:06:24.629> this

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
are only going to be affected by this

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.689 
are only going to be affected by this
mask<00:06:26.659> all<00:06:27.659> right<00:06:27.839> so<00:06:28.259> if<00:06:28.740> we<00:06:29.009> were<00:06:29.279> to<00:06:29.430> render

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
mask all right so if we were to render

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:30.580 
mask all right so if we were to render
this

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
this

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.960 
this
change<00:06:30.740> because<00:06:31.220> that's<00:06:31.430> what<00:06:31.640> doesn't<00:06:31.880> do

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
change because that's what doesn't do

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.260 
change because that's what doesn't do
anything<00:06:32.770> all<00:06:33.770> right<00:06:33.830> it's<00:06:34.160> any<00:06:34.430> texture<00:06:35.030> and

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
anything all right it's any texture and

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.560 
anything all right it's any texture and
then<00:06:35.390> that<00:06:35.600> noir<00:06:35.950> for<00:06:36.950> normals<00:06:37.430> this<00:06:37.940> is<00:06:38.150> not

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
then that noir for normals this is not

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.200 
then that noir for normals this is not
going<00:06:38.810> to<00:06:38.870> influence<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.440> color<00:06:40.370> but<00:06:40.880> the

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
going to influence the color but the

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.960 
going to influence the color but the
geometry<00:06:42.110> so<00:06:42.290> now<00:06:43.280> we<00:06:43.340> can<00:06:43.550> make<00:06:43.640> it<00:06:43.790> nice<00:06:43.940> and

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
geometry so now we can make it nice and

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
geometry so now we can make it nice and
bumpy<00:06:44.450> so<00:06:45.200> enable<00:06:45.800> normal<00:06:46.310> and<00:06:46.490> we<00:06:47.420> render<00:06:47.720> and

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
bumpy so enable normal and we render and

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.010 
bumpy so enable normal and we render and
I<00:06:48.500> can<00:06:48.740> see<00:06:48.920> it's<00:06:49.040> nice<00:06:49.310> and<00:06:50.080> bumpy<00:06:52.870> even<00:06:53.870> in<00:06:53.960> a

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
I can see it's nice and bumpy even in a

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.190 
I can see it's nice and bumpy even in a
nice<00:06:54.550> uneven<00:06:55.550> texture<00:06:56.390> you<00:06:56.720> know<00:06:56.750> surface

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
nice uneven texture you know surface

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.750 
nice uneven texture you know surface
texture<00:06:57.620> and<00:06:59.620> we<00:07:00.620> can<00:07:00.830> it<00:07:01.310> looks<00:07:01.580> a<00:07:01.670> little

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
texture and we can it looks a little

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.870 
texture and we can it looks a little
dirty<00:07:02.030> right<00:07:02.330> now<00:07:02.360> it's<00:07:02.690> like<00:07:03.020> yellowish<00:07:03.880> so

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
dirty right now it's like yellowish so

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.770 
dirty right now it's like yellowish so
we<00:07:05.120> can<00:07:05.360> actually<00:07:06.790> let<00:07:07.790> me<00:07:07.850> just<00:07:07.880> decrease

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 
we can actually let me just decrease

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.400 
we can actually let me just decrease
that<00:07:09.020> one

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
that one

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.470 
that one
let<00:07:09.650> it<00:07:09.770> be<00:07:09.890> pure<00:07:10.310> white<00:07:10.520> but<00:07:10.730> decreasing<00:07:11.300> gray

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
let it be pure white but decreasing gray

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.550 
let it be pure white but decreasing gray
there<00:07:12.050> you<00:07:12.230> go

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
there you go

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.420 
there you go
that's<00:07:12.800> much<00:07:13.010> better<00:07:13.460> all<00:07:14.090> right<00:07:14.210> the<00:07:14.570> color

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
that's much better all right the color

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.610 
that's much better all right the color
texture<00:07:16.430> we're<00:07:16.790> gonna<00:07:16.910> just<00:07:17.270> have<00:07:17.630> it<00:07:18.290> pure

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.620 
texture we're gonna just have it pure

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.240 
texture we're gonna just have it pure
white<00:07:18.860> and<00:07:19.130> then<00:07:20.080> bring<00:07:21.080> down<00:07:21.110> the<00:07:21.560> intensity

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
white and then bring down the intensity

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.980 
white and then bring down the intensity
shader<00:07:22.910> I'm<00:07:23.180> not<00:07:23.390> sure<00:07:23.510> what<00:07:23.630> that's<00:07:23.720> called

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
shader I'm not sure what that's called

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.160 
shader I'm not sure what that's called
but<00:07:24.860> up<00:07:25.070> bringing<00:07:25.670> down<00:07:25.850> in<00:07:26.090> color<00:07:26.420> and<00:07:26.660> now

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
but up bringing down in color and now

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.480 
but up bringing down in color and now
this<00:07:27.260> actually<00:07:27.650> does<00:07:27.800> look<00:07:27.980> like<00:07:28.100> a<00:07:28.160> bathroom

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
this actually does look like a bathroom

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.210 
this actually does look like a bathroom
