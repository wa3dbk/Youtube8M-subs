00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
guys tomorrow so I'm gonna tell you with

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.390 
guys tomorrow so I'm gonna tell you with
my<00:02:12.810> class<00:02:13.230> setup<00:02:13.560> where<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.920> right<00:02:14.310> now

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
my class setup where it is right now

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.840 
my class setup where it is right now
it's<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.240> tar-21<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.410> silencer<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
it's the tar-21 with silencer and the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.030 
it's the tar-21 with silencer and the
fall<00:02:18.030> camo<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.110> think<00:02:19.350> my<00:02:19.470> secondary

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
fall camo and then I think my secondary

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.510 
fall camo and then I think my secondary
is<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> spas-12<00:02:20.700> FMJ<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.770> great<00:02:23.040> secondary

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
is a spas-12 FMJ it's a great secondary

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.290 
is a spas-12 FMJ it's a great secondary
better<00:02:24.240> than<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> space<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:25.020> mw3<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:27.000> that

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
better than the space or mw3 I know that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.480 
better than the space or mw3 I know that
for<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> fact<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.990> lot<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.410> things<00:02:28.530> everything<00:02:29.400> in

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
for a fact a lot of things everything in

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.030 
for a fact a lot of things everything in
this<00:02:29.580> game<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.030> overpowered<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.000> guess<00:02:33.480> it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
this game is overpowered so I guess it's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.580 
this game is overpowered so I guess it's
balanced<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.220> old<00:02:35.520> Howard<00:02:35.760> guns<00:02:36.590> alright

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
balanced with old Howard guns alright

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
balanced with old Howard guns alright
