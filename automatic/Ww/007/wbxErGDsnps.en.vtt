screws back in once you have the screws

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.240 
screws back in once you have the screws
in<00:03:01.880> we<00:03:02.030> can<00:03:02.209> connect<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.570> wire<00:03:02.720> harness<00:03:03.250> all

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
in we can connect the wire harness all

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.360 
in we can connect the wire harness all
you<00:03:04.459> have<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.940> grab<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> two<00:03:05.480> ends<00:03:05.780> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
you have to do is grab the two ends and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.130 
you have to do is grab the two ends and
they<00:03:07.370> only<00:03:07.519> go<00:03:07.700> one<00:03:07.940> way<00:03:07.970> plug<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.109> back

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
they only go one way plug it back

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.410 
they only go one way plug it back
together<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.579> locks<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.120> get<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.269> good

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
together so it locks in you get a good

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.470 
together so it locks in you get a good
connection<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.670> then<00:03:13.670> we<00:03:13.790> have<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.090> put<00:03:14.359> it

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
connection and then we have to put it

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.449 
connection and then we have to put it
back<00:03:14.630> into<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.140> little<00:03:15.350> holding<00:03:15.560> clip<00:03:15.799> so

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
back into the little holding clip so

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.830 
back into the little holding clip so
we're<00:03:16.579> going<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.760> kind<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.090> fold<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.630> up<00:03:17.780> like

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
we're going to kind of fold it up like

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.759 
we're going to kind of fold it up like
that<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:19.130> put<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.549> in<00:03:19.640> there<00:03:23.560> once<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.680> have

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
that and put it in there once you have

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.129 
that and put it in there once you have
it<00:03:24.889> in<00:03:24.980> place<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.489> can<00:03:25.670> twist<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:26.780> together

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
it in place you can twist this together

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.509 
it in place you can twist this together
so<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:27.980> locks<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.459> place<00:03:30.340> once<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.400> have

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
so it locks it in place once you have

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.009 
so it locks it in place once you have
the<00:03:31.609> part<00:03:31.760> installed<00:03:32.060> we<00:03:32.269> can<00:03:32.450> put<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.750> washer

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
the part installed we can put the washer

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.840 
the part installed we can put the washer
back<00:03:33.200> up<00:03:33.319> on<00:03:33.470> its<00:03:33.620> feet<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.950> reconnect<00:03:34.760> the
