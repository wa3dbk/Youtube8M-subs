I<00:02:51.220> wanted<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:52.030> something<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.680> thought

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
I wanted to see something that I thought

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.490 
I wanted to see something that I thought
would<00:02:55.000> probably<00:02:55.239> pop<00:02:55.750> up<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.200> think<00:02:56.380> it's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
would probably pop up and I think it's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.470 
would probably pop up and I think it's
going<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:58.000> question

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
going to but I have to do this question

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.380 
going to but I have to do this question
first<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.160> meantime<00:03:00.310> let's<00:03:00.970> put<00:03:01.180> him<00:03:01.270> on

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
first in the meantime let's put him on

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.600 
first in the meantime let's put him on
that<00:03:01.510> quest<00:03:01.860> let's<00:03:02.860> see<00:03:03.040> what<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.340> looks<00:03:03.370> like

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that quest let's see what it looks like

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.040 
that quest let's see what it looks like
oh<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:06.730> pretty<00:03:06.820> cool<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.269> he's<00:03:07.390> flying<00:03:07.600> kind

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
oh it's pretty cool so he's flying kind

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.449 
oh it's pretty cool so he's flying kind
of<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.290> in<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.500> very<00:03:08.650> beginning<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:09.340> a

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
of like in the very beginning and it's a

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.729 
of like in the very beginning and it's a
short<00:03:09.760> fly<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.239> think<00:03:11.110> he's<00:03:11.200> kind<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.410> scoped

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
short fly I think he's kind of scoped

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.280 
short fly I think he's kind of scoped
out<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.890> area<00:03:12.220> for<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.550> evil<00:03:12.930> he'll<00:03:13.930> never

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
