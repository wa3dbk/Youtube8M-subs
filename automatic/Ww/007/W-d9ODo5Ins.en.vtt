00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.970
 your videos out of focus yes that's what you call 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.410
 introduction hey people in this video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.139
 again a tweet video for you 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.360
 and that's about protect photos 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.340
 protect photos is free in the cd 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:25.289
 available and what you can join 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:27.779
 I show you now protect photos can 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.880
 her the photo album app completely per 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 password protection and not just the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.809
 Of course, the photo album app also the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.180
 Camera app and all related apps 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 the just on the photo album on the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 to grab photo albums 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.290
 however, we still have this trick 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 the option all other apps with one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.960
 password 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.280
 we actually go for just once in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.739
 the settings and look 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.510
 protect photos now we need as 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.719
 first enter a password what I 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.920
 really very good 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.480
 before getting any settings 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.059
 You have to do that as you said 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.280
 enter password and my password is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.290
 just do not do anything this simple 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.049
 ok that is to say now my 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.130
 password as yes to those just times 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.799
 to show faster 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 so now we have some slider here 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.090
 or disable and ableton enable buttons 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.170
 and protect photo under the under 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.759
 this button or respectively 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.740
 slider is then again something for 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.689
 a function of the first 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 is fotoprojekt foto there will be 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 photo albums so the photo app locked at 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.619
 protect camera you can imagine 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.100
 camera locked away at protect photos in 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.680
 all apps so if you have that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.750
 photo albums by others so by third 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.750
 apps from third-party apps on the photo albums 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.310
 whoever is able to access it here too 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.259
 a password will be set up 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.540
 then we have protect photos here 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 in wallpaper yes if we in the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.659
 Settings at wallpaper are 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.770
 we first got a wallpapers and 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.270
 choose albums if we can 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.159
 password entered when we got it 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 enabled here so we still pay 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.909
 times and indeed application projects yes that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.710
 is really cool and although can now 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.810
 really every app i can give it to you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.760
 Just show it here 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.220
 I have only disabled around so far 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.440
 such a show 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.030
 and that's really cool too and then 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.410
 we still have set password as I said 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.510
 for me there is nothing now that could be something 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.710
 type in and click on return and then 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.760
 This password will be too 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.890
 set up 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.080
 So I'll just show you that too 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.440
 locked with me yes is such an empty one 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.110
 password I say here so it looks 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.280
 the whole thing works out perfectly 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.380
 impeccable everything and for that it 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.120
 it's really nice for free 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.280
 Let's look at it the whole time like us 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.700
 we get that in, of course 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.770
 Let cydia load and search 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.370
 just after protect photos as I said 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.470
 if you do not find the app resp 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.980
 This quote would just have to cdu 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.940
 update completely current 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.660
 and then the whole thing would have to be 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.250
 Pop up 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.570
 you just go on top of installing 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.670
