00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
more step so you can see this goes all

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.980 
more step so you can see this goes all
the<00:01:41.579> way<00:01:41.850> down<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> bottom<00:01:42.390> makes<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the way down to the bottom makes it a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
the way down to the bottom makes it a
lot<00:01:43.110> easier<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:44.430> board<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.479> know

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
lot easier to to board for you know

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.590 
lot easier to to board for you know
folks<00:01:45.899> older<00:01:46.320> folks<00:01:46.560> younger<00:01:47.009> folks<00:01:47.600> that's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
folks older folks younger folks that's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.859 
folks older folks younger folks that's
another<00:01:48.869> upgrade<00:01:49.439> they<00:01:49.590> made<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.070> year

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
another upgrade they made for this year

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.719 
another upgrade they made for this year
and<00:01:51.869> again<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.350> boarding<00:01:53.009> ladders<00:01:53.310> recessed

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and again this boarding ladders recessed

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.580 
and again this boarding ladders recessed
inside<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.420> splash<00:01:54.810> well<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
inside the splash well here so it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
inside the splash well here so it
doesn't<00:01:55.619> stick<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.219> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> another<00:01:57.509> nice

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
doesn't stick out which is another nice

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.090 
doesn't stick out which is another nice
feature<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.350> way<00:01:58.500> when<00:01:58.680> you're<00:01:58.799> pulling

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
feature that way when you're pulling

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.499 
feature that way when you're pulling
tubes<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.490> things<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.850> ladder<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.240> in

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tubes and things your ladder is not in

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.459 
tubes and things your ladder is not in
the<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.509> see<00:02:03.689> that's<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> lot

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the way so you can see that's not a lot

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.749 
the way so you can see that's not a lot
to<00:02:04.590> change<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.040> outside<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759

exception<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:07.409> again<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
exception of that and then again the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529 
exception of that and then again the
graphics<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.459> let's<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> inside<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
graphics but let's go on the inside and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.230 
graphics but let's go on the inside and
we'll<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.899> over<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
of the elements you just zip this down

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.119 
of the elements you just zip this down
you<00:02:54.000> know<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.299> then<00:02:54.450> snap<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.900> gate<00:02:55.530> shut<00:02:55.889> and

then it kind of gets you cuts the wind

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.470 
then it kind of gets you cuts the wind
out<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.340> cockpit<00:02:59.579> there's<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.239> kind<00:03:00.389> of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
out of the cockpit there's the kind of

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.610 
out of the cockpit there's the kind of
waste<00:03:00.689> design<00:03:01.109> so<00:03:01.669> it's<00:03:03.079> very<00:03:04.079> nice<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.439> have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
waste design so it's very nice to have

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.199 
waste design so it's very nice to have
now<00:03:04.829> this<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.129> another<00:03:05.370> option<00:03:05.849> it's<00:03:05.970> called

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
now this is another option it's called

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.990 
now this is another option it's called
the<00:03:06.419> the<00:03:07.019> Sun<00:03:07.260> top<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.889> you<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.549> see<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.849> got

the the Sun top and you can see it's got

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.149 
the the Sun top and you can see it's got
its<00:03:09.150> own<00:03:09.209> hider<00:03:09.540> here<00:03:09.810> underneath<00:03:10.169> the<00:03:10.680> hell

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
its own hider here underneath the hell

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.550 
its own hider here underneath the hell
or<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.579> aft<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.870> can<00:03:13.109> get<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.319> out<00:03:13.409> of<00:03:13.439> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
or the aft so you can get it out of the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.559 
or the aft so you can get it out of the

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
the step going leading into the bow got

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.000 
the step going leading into the bow got
a<00:05:42.720> little<00:05:42.930> storage<00:05:43.140> compartment<00:05:43.230> there<00:05:43.800> with

a little storage compartment there with

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.250 
a little storage compartment there with
the<00:05:44.100> walkthrough<00:05:44.490> curtain<00:05:44.960> so<00:05:45.960> this<00:05:46.140> is

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
the walkthrough curtain so this is

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.170 
the walkthrough curtain so this is
basically<00:05:46.560> district<00:05:46.980> step<00:05:47.220> and<00:05:47.700> we<00:05:47.910> still

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
basically district step and we still

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.720 
basically district step and we still
have<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.480> bow<00:05:48.660> conversion<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.430> can<00:05:50.550> lift

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
have the bow conversion so you can lift

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.160 
have the bow conversion so you can lift
this<00:05:50.880> up<00:05:51.090> you've<00:05:51.330> got<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.480> cooler<00:05:51.840> here<00:05:52.020> that

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
this up you've got a cooler here that

00:05:52.170 --> 00:06:06.140 
this up you've got a cooler here that
removes<00:05:52.880> so<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:54.060> comes<00:05:54.330> out<00:06:04.910> fold<00:06:05.910> that<00:06:06.090> down

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
removes so this comes out fold that down

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.240 
removes so this comes out fold that down
so<00:06:07.020> this<00:06:07.140> way<00:06:07.290> if<00:06:07.380> you<00:06:07.470> have<00:06:07.560> bow<00:06:07.740> Reuters<00:06:08.130> you

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
so this way if you have bow Reuters you

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.740 
so this way if you have bow Reuters you
can<00:06:08.400> open<00:06:08.670> up<00:06:08.760> you<00:06:09.090> know<00:06:09.180> you've<00:06:09.330> got<00:06:09.540> more
