00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.499
 yeah 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.789
 hi to all andrea is then 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:25.289
 today we meet again 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 videos and this is there the record record of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.349
 three times three singles and beat so 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.180
 5 55 valcke corn was finally finally 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.059
 had come down from maintenance and 5.25 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.670
 by the american hill burns so that's it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.920
 so hill burns champion states 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.899
 united 2014 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.910
 the second to beat felix in a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.070
 competition 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.190
 so that's not a felix that will have 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.719
 defeated 5 55 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 these hills so I'm pretty happy 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.649
 that it's hill because it's a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.179
 guy who I like who is nice 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.120
 on his channel he makes lots of videos 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.579
 to help us progress 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 this is a very good thing that hubert he 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.130
 deserves anyway when we look at his 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 hello i will show you the 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.720
 description I read after it is enough 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.980
 the ucly but still it's only one who 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.410
 is really really impressive 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.100
 because he recognized ak to force the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.730
 plf and pnl skip both less 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 half a second 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.870
 so very quickly and then the execution 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.220
 soil but is really perfect 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 So here it is the merit of this vow 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.520
 there will be many who say he would have 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.090
 well liked it be felix and not felix 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.680
 who will have this world records but hey that's it 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.000
 we all know 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 that's all that felix would be that the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.870
 best here is ivory felix record of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.000
 reggie world records in many others 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.760
 many more evans 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.050
 I believe he has 6 8 7 6 his assets three 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.520
 sets 6-7 years of reign so here we know 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.610
 all that FÃ©lix traces the best but 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.470
 but hey it's the single it's not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.090
 necessarily representative of the level 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.470
 and here I am glad it's 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.479
 Colline and that 's it 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.009
 goes down the world records general so 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.360
 this was really unexpected he 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.350
 would not be a lot of people 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 was expecting ac it's him and that's it 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.680
 our good I think that's what your 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 body will last less than that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 other banks in any case than that of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.550
 mass or that of 5,66 of felix because 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.590
 that frankly there as felix said 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.750
 precisely in the interview with red 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 cabs and community cubes hours a 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 really progressed in voice ya more and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.900
 more of the solver on youtube that post 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 videos with morons of 5.2 12 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.670
 even 5 years below issoire in 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.320
 below 9 or even below 8 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.620
 there it is more than it is more than matt 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.380
 valcu that felix here I think I think 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.700
 Felix will resume the world will resume 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.950
 records to date either one for sure 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.299
 but here I am, to show you the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.299
 reconstruction for you see 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:34.820
 and that's it and that's it for this video 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.050
 so I hope you liked it 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.120
 it was a little video a bit off 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.260
 series that comes out of the lot here 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.610
 I like doing small things 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
 videos like that maybe I'll do it 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.190
 other 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.880
 so here we have all spent a good 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.880
 day has more
