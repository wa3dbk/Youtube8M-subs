00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.850
 I am not very popular yet

 windows phone 8x 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.030
 The design of the smartphone is quite bright and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.520
 modern housing is single color and has 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 in its arsenal 4 colors smartphone 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.020
 made of soft-touch plastic

 it is comfortable to hold in his hand and he 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.789
 does not slip at all and is also pleasant 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.500
 To the touch assembly very high quality

 device sync cable and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.210
 fairly simple headset 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.210
 no bonuses only the most necessary 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.380
 touch screen 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 super lcd with a diagonal of 4 3 inches and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.299
 1280 by 720 pixels with 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 good viewing angles and natural 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.049
 color rendition protective display 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.360
 first generation gorilla glass 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.939
 it is not scratched during operation 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.820
 it still appears at all 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.530
 small scuffs work with the screen 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.320
 quite comfortable in the sun it also 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.270
 Remains readable for cameras 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 at windows phone 8x 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.030
 their 2 front 2 and 1 megapixels and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.579
 back i.e. main on 8 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.649
 megapixels camera settings allows 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.290
 set the white balance and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.110
 exposure and so on also for photo 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.540
 quality photo effects are provided and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.979
 The video is quite good and completely 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.649
 corresponds to the level of modern 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 smartphone device not only has 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.040
 marking beats audio 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.150
 but also fully supports this 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.340
 technology 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.830
 when you turn on beats audio 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.810
 the sound gets deeper and more spacious 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.790
 volume level is enough 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 for my taste even with a small margin 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.940
 smartphone works on dual core 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.970
 a processor with a clock speed of one and a half 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.100
 gigahertz also on board installed one 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.940
 gigabytes of ram storage 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.910
 data 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 16 gigabytes of internal memory is allocated 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.710
 use of memory cards unfortunately not 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.480
 provided for short 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.940
 fast enough with any 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.890
 the tasks posed to cheer 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 which is natural to modern 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.550
 device this support in 7 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 wireless popular protocols 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.830
 data transfer among which Wi fi 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 bluetooth as well as satellite system 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.459
 gps navigation 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.160
 also device supports technology 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.320
 nfc for wireless data transmission 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.820
 battery capacity is a thousand 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.980
 eight hundred milliamp-hours 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.690
 comparing with android competitors what is not 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.739
 may not please windows phone and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:16.440
 work longer controlled device 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.690
 windows phone 8 operating system 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.000
 one of the most important goodies of this 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.100
 the operating system is live 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.340
 icons whose main task 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.160
 display the information you need 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.739
 frequently used application contacts 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.870
 social bookmarking games and any 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.750
 the information of them will always be with you 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.890
 handy or rather under your finger 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.690
 and even more 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.330
 information is updated in mode 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.640
 real time and displayed on 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 lock screen however with a point 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.410
 view interface in my mind windows 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.049
 phone is still inferior to such a competitor 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.700
 like ayos and android pretty poor 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.070
 interface personalization allows 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.230
 change the color and kunak of the phone only to 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.700
 preset colors are also missing 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.560
 ability to sort 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.540
 or group applications in the menu 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.380
 Of course it is not so critical but also 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 the advantage is also the fault 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.030
 the operating system itself works very 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.460
 fast and stable even embedded 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.100
 internet explorer does not cause any 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.200
 complaints unlike his desktop 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.780
 brother in the shell immediately embedded 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.850
 navigation and office suite a 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.920
 also different nice little things 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.990
 additional applications easily 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.880
 downloaded from the online market to 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.610
 Unfortunately, windows phone platform 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.070
 today is very far behind 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.080
 by quantity and most importantly by quality 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.340
 software from their 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.160
 main competitors 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:46.180
 it only remains to hope that this is a question 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:49.300
 I have enough time in my opinion 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.390
 successful to have a good stuffing and externally 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.710
 looks pretty nice and modern 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.230
 housing materials and assembly 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.910
 are at a good high level and not 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.370
 causes no complaints 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.620
 smartphone functionality and features 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.720
 also not separated by the sole of 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.030
 disadvantages of this smartphone is 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.860
 his software platform for now 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.870
 quantity and quality 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.720
 developed software for the platform 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.910
 windows phone 8 is behind the main 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.070
 competitors for a year and maybe even 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.170
 more that's what happens with the hardware 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.570
 Part of everything is super, but the software 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.090
 pumped up but if you don't strive to be 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.800
 in the know of all software innovations and graphics 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.900
 in mobile games for you does not play 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.090
 crucial role then this flaw can 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.550
 boldly discard and more attentively 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.650
 look at this smartphone this 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.110
 phone you can purchase networks 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.570
 mobile phone stores and also on our 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.450
 website at affordable prices and 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:48.450
 remember friends time often kills those 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.450
 who seeks to kill time pierre bahus
