00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
if you want to give it a little more

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.109 
if you want to give it a little more
vintage<00:01:13.470> look<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.490> give<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.030> know

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
vintage look you can give it you know

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
vintage look you can give it you know
six<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.630> seven<00:01:15.990> coats<00:01:16.229> because<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
six or seven coats because then it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
six or seven coats because then it
starts<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> crackle<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.330> clump<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
starts to crackle and clump up a bit and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.310 
starts to crackle and clump up a bit and
so<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.159> starts<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> look<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.390> older<00:01:21.930> style

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so it starts to look like an older style

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.580 
so it starts to look like an older style
can<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> did<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> couple<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.990> extra<00:01:25.320> coats

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
can so I did a couple more extra coats

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.499 
can so I did a couple more extra coats
so<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.100> give<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.670> unique<00:01:27.000> look

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so I could give it that unique look

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.590 
so I could give it that unique look
about<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.180> cool

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
about it and then this is really cool

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
about it and then this is really cool
too<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.500> also<00:01:31.680> opens<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.759> can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
too because it also opens up so you can

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
too because it also opens up so you can
store<00:01:33.299> some<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:33.990> doll<00:01:34.290> drinks<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> here

store some of your doll drinks in here

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.440 
store some of your doll drinks in here
as<00:01:35.400> well

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450
