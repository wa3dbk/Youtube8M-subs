got here is up got an add-on kit with it
as<00:00:27.390> well<00:00:27.830> but<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.980> main<00:00:29.250> line<00:00:29.840> just<00:00:30.840> comes<00:00:31.109> on

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
as well but this main line just comes on

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.639 
as well but this main line just comes on
the<00:00:31.320> outside<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> box<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.660> our<00:00:34.410> hose

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the outside of the box here and our hose

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.430 
the outside of the box here and our hose
attaches<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.110> you've<00:00:37.260> got

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
attaches right here and then you've got

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.600 
attaches right here and then you've got
these<00:00:37.620> drips<00:00:38.360> it's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> gyp<00:00:39.719> take<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:41.370> just

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
these drips it's a gyp take that just

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
these drips it's a gyp take that just
runs<00:00:41.820> along<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:43.250> length<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.870> foot

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
runs along the length of your foot

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.250 
runs along the length of your foot
you'll<00:00:46.200> put<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.860> strips<00:00:47.539> /<00:00:51.079> for<00:00:52.079> my

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you'll put two of these strips / for my

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.450 
you'll put two of these strips / for my
foursquare

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.350 

and<00:00:57.460> these<00:00:57.730> actually<00:00:58.000> have<00:01:00.150> drips<00:01:03.030> every<00:01:04.030> 4

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
and these actually have drips every 4

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.970 
and these actually have drips every 4
inches<00:01:05.670> drip<00:01:06.670> emitters<00:01:06.850> on<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.900> so<00:01:08.830> you're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
inches drip emitters on this so you're

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.860 
inches drip emitters on this so you're
going<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.130> have<00:01:10.440> 44<00:01:11.440> drips<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.610> 1<00:01:13.330> 12<00:01:13.660> inch

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
going to have 44 drips in 1 12 inch

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.740 
going to have 44 drips in 1 12 inch
square<00:01:14.290> which<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:14.770> really<00:01:15.130> ideal<00:01:15.510> for<00:01:16.510> the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
square which is really ideal for the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.240 
square which is really ideal for the
size<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.200> then<00:01:20.350> over<00:01:20.680> here<00:01:20.710> I'll<00:01:20.979> show<00:01:21.010> you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
size and then over here I'll show you

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.030 
size and then over here I'll show you
how<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.729> an<00:01:24.850> add-on<00:01:25.650> kit<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:26.979> you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
how this this is an add-on kit so you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.030 
how this this is an add-on kit so you
can<00:01:27.250> actually<00:01:27.280> attach<00:01:28.320> two<00:01:29.320> systems<00:01:29.920> together

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
can actually attach two systems together

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.540 
can actually attach two systems together
to<00:01:30.790> water<00:01:31.060> two<00:01:31.420> boxes<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:33.160> have<00:01:33.369> these

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
to water two boxes and I have these

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.930 
to water two boxes and I have these
available<00:01:33.700> for<00:01:34.210> four<00:01:34.509> by<00:01:34.720> eight<00:01:35.729> boxes<00:01:36.729> as

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
available for four by eight boxes as

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.520 
available for four by eight boxes as
well<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.740> basically<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.869> will<00:01:41.110> work<00:01:41.259> for

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
well but basically this will work for

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.550 
well but basically this will work for
with<00:01:42.100> one<00:01:42.400> hose<00:01:42.729> attachment<00:01:43.509> so<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.080> assembly

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
with one hose attachment so the assembly

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.790 
with one hose attachment so the assembly
basically<00:01:45.130> entails<00:01:46.410> using<00:01:47.410> these<00:01:47.530> little

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
basically entails using these little

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.350 
basically entails using these little
barbs<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:50.110> like<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.410> use<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.910> some<00:01:51.910> pliers<00:01:52.150> to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
barbs and I like to use a some pliers to

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.870 
barbs and I like to use a some pliers to
hold<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.759> know<00:01:54.850> just

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
hold that with and you know just

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.499 
hold that with and you know just
inserting<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:57.369> into<00:01:57.550> this<00:01:57.790> micro

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
inserting that right into this micro

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.870 
inserting that right into this micro
tubing<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.440> it<00:02:00.130> takes<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.460> little<00:02:00.610> bit<00:02:00.819> of

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
tubing and it takes a little bit of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.389 
tubing and it takes a little bit of
forest<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.929> insert<00:02:02.289> that<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.250> you've<00:02:03.369> got

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
forest to insert that so you've got

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.880 
forest to insert that so you've got
eight<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.880> those<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.330> insert<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.380> then<00:02:05.410> once

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
eight of those to insert and then once

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.180 
eight of those to insert and then once
they're<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.940> tubing<00:02:07.600> like<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
they're in in this tubing like this you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.140 
they're in in this tubing like this you
will<00:02:10.260> just<00:02:11.260> poke<00:02:11.620> them<00:02:11.920> right<00:02:12.370> into<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.940> main

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
will just poke them right into the main

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.210 
will just poke them right into the main
line<00:02:13.710> like<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:14.920> poke<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.940> right<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
line like this poke it right in and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.059 
line like this poke it right in and
that's<00:02:18.220> pretty<00:02:18.880> simple<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:22.890> you've<00:02:23.890> got

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
that's pretty simple to do you've got

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.620 
that's pretty simple to do you've got
eight<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.430> these<00:02:24.550> pieces<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.450> will

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
eight of these pieces and you will

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.120 
eight of these pieces and you will
insert<00:02:26.319> them<00:02:28.140> run<00:02:29.140> into<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> main<00:02:29.620> line<00:02:29.830> and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
insert them run into the main line and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.240 
insert them run into the main line and
it<00:02:30.190> snaps<00:02:30.580> like<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:32.140> then<00:02:32.830> your<00:02:33.040> drip

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
it snaps like that and then your drip
