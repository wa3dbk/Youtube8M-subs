 with the effort be a series of reframes understand why were 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.590

 ok it's good time 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.210
 who would have thought 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 even if the past 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.800
 This is paradoxical 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.820
 you do not see how they do 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.969
 what is needed is to choose the good god 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.770
 it's both just to see 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.960
 he had selected 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 but it was very good 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
 last week see 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.290

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.690
 coriander 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.350

 he will subsequently be 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.069
 the din of compensation 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.970
 all the more relevant as the Afghan forces 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.640
 at the beginning I prepared a dish what I like very much that I call 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.039
 shrimp avocado revisited 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.339

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.150
 impasse by winning the first part in Morocco until after a while to 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.949
 the other 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.949
 the Swiss took off as a simple citizen in a hurry 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.829
 that's what I like but that's the real thing 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.919
 it's a very good one to take for others this annual campaign is at 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.859
 the base of grapefruit juice 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.839

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.919
 I do not understand 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.179
 so to peel the tie we should not be a problem 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.769
 for me the first 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.019
 promeo announcement 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.019

 French of the uicn and primaries 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.639
 bringing it closer not wanted to give a little nudge 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.989
 at the water's edge 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.989

 the shallots that we will add to grapefruit shrimp now 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.849
 it will happen 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.109
 I'm going to consider greens - if you have very good recruits are 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.589
 accusations of Zionist conspiracy against fire 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.239
 final of the c1 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.480
 indeed so beautiful so castlculier already learned yesterday the little things that make 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.409
 dreaming with stéphane for me it's very rewarding 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.409
 so in fact if I did it to bring without small goal 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.869
 the Russian Federation 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.869
 the Marseilles must be the current film on the title the analyst

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.789
 so that's if the work would not be taxed baclofen 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.869
 not in what we do and it must hurt to put on top of our 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.560
 little grapefruit shrimp salad in the game we'll just slipped 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.079
 the lawyer at afp 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.239
 but I'm going to pierce myself with flexibility and without accepting it because we can 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.809
 come I do not know 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.819

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.349
 even 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.430
 and so we see that a little bit of time 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 videotron preserve appearances 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.090

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.610
 nancy it's been five months firm will to go running naked in a world all 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.310
 prepared for the advanced but against it is true that it really becomes 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.529
 serious 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.729
 everything is very serious not trace with our guests 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.729
 afp 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.999
 klaba me I really like the crisis 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.999
 Eurasian 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.460
 thousands of ducks 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.169

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.479
 I think that's what is terrible 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.599
 but she will have one of the brothers so is there I left 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.740
 the Australian chocolate site on the theme of dark chocolate I took the 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.120
 White chocolate

 in the bush 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.620
 this passion fruit 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.550
 my age of 3 23% 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.210
 to taste in the civil war 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.210

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.949
 all the circuits of 5 and 2 years fired on it 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:59.939

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.949
 with the help of stéphane geufroi 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.789
 It was excellent 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.930
 it's very easy to use 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.039
 surprising to the fallout of the only culprit waste
