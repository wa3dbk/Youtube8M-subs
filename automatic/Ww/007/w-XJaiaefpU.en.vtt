white balance for a group of photos now
in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> past<00:00:14.160> we've<00:00:14.400> shown<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.670> how<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
in the past we've shown you how to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.590 
in the past we've shown you how to
correct<00:00:15.660> white<00:00:15.990> balance<00:00:16.130> but<00:00:17.449> usually<00:00:18.449> what

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
correct white balance but usually what

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.870 
correct white balance but usually what
will<00:00:18.750> happen<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.680> take<00:00:19.980> your<00:00:20.460> photos

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
will happen is if you take your photos

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.300 
will happen is if you take your photos
without<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> correct<00:00:22.140> white<00:00:22.439> balance<00:00:22.470> you'll

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
without the correct white balance you'll

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
without the correct white balance you'll
find<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.000> you've<00:00:24.539> taken<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.080> whole<00:00:25.320> bunch<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
find that you've taken a whole bunch of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.830 
find that you've taken a whole bunch of
photos<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.760> incorrect<00:00:27.150> white<00:00:27.630> balance<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
photos with incorrect white balance and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.519 
photos with incorrect white balance and
there's<00:00:30.840> number<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.380> could

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
there's number of things that could

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
there's number of things that could
happen<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> either

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
happen when you do this is that either

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.810 
happen when you do this is that either
you're<00:00:33.989> taking<00:00:34.260> photos<00:00:34.530> outside<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.399> there

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you're taking photos outside and there

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
you're taking photos outside and there
is<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.840> lighting<00:00:37.290> condition<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> changing

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
is the lighting condition is changing

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
is the lighting condition is changing
you've<00:00:38.760> taken<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> over<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.719> period<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.559> time

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you've taken it over a period of time

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
you've taken it over a period of time
where<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.000> light<00:00:42.210> values<00:00:42.750> would<00:00:43.079> be

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
where the light values would be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
where the light values would be
different<00:00:43.620> or<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.100> different<00:00:44.250> rooms<00:00:44.640> or<00:00:45.090> would

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
different or in different rooms or would

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.209 
different or in different rooms or would
have<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.899> concentrations<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.920> color

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
have different concentrations of color

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
have different concentrations of color
of<00:00:47.430> light<00:00:47.700> or<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:49.200> would<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.500> taken<00:00:49.739> at

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of light or you would have taken at

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
of light or you would have taken at
least<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.670> portion<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.390> photos<00:00:51.870> within

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
least a portion of your photos within

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
least a portion of your photos within
the<00:00:52.800> same<00:00:53.039> lighting<00:00:53.340> conditions<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> you'll

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the same lighting conditions and you'll

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
the same lighting conditions and you'll
find<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.809> usually<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.620> happens

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
find that usually this is what happens

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
find that usually this is what happens
so<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.879> example<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.530> at

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so for example if we have a look here at

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.979 
so for example if we have a look here at
this<00:00:58.859> photo<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.850> photo<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.239> taken<00:01:00.270> outside

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
this photo this photo was taken outside

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.460 
this photo this photo was taken outside
now<00:01:01.430> I've<00:01:02.430> taken<00:01:02.609> many<00:01:02.969> photos<00:01:03.390> outside<00:01:03.719> on

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
now I've taken many photos outside on

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
now I've taken many photos outside on
the<00:01:04.619> beach<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.880> were<00:01:05.939> unfortunately

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the beach and they were unfortunately

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
the beach and they were unfortunately
all<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.070> correct<00:01:08.430> white<00:01:08.700> balance

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
all with this in correct white balance

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.270 
all with this in correct white balance
so<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> whole<00:01:09.689> group<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.290> photos<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
so I have a whole group of photos that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690 
so I have a whole group of photos that
are<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.420> bluish<00:01:13.170> red<00:01:13.950> tint<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
are they have this bluish red tint to it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
are they have this bluish red tint to it
that<00:01:15.150> was<00:01:15.299> set<00:01:15.509> incorrectly<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> camera

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that was set incorrectly in the camera

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980 
that was set incorrectly in the camera
and<00:01:16.860> instead<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> correcting<00:01:18.420> each<00:01:18.630> one

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and instead of correcting each one

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.499 
and instead of correcting each one
individually<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.790> show<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.150> how

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
individually we're going to show you how

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.070 
individually we're going to show you how
to<00:01:21.540> create<00:01:21.960> an<00:01:22.640> automated<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> save<00:01:24.810> an

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to create an automated way to save an

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100 
to create an automated way to save an
action<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.159> save<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> correction<00:01:27.330> done<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
action to save the correction done to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.530 
action to save the correction done to
the<00:01:28.229> photo<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.159> apply<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> exact

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the photo and then apply that exact

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.719 
the photo and then apply that exact
correction<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> same<00:01:32.159> group<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.520> photos

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
correction so the same group of photos

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
correction so the same group of photos
now<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> imperative<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:34.740> you're

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
now it is imperative that when you're

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
now it is imperative that when you're
doing<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.310> you're<00:01:35.579> doing<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
doing this you're doing this to the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
doing this you're doing this to the
group<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.829> photos<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.369> has<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> same<00:01:38.909> light

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
group of photos that has the same light

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.980 
group of photos that has the same light
value<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.479> opening<00:01:42.689> up

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
value so you can see this by opening up

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
value so you can see this by opening up
the<00:01:43.170> photos<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.280> group<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
the photos and if you have a group of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.270 
the photos and if you have a group of
photos<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.570> equally<00:01:46.170> off<00:01:46.560> if

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
photos that are all equally off if

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.690 
photos that are all equally off if
they're<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.640> equally<00:01:48.119> red<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.340> yellow<00:01:50.340> or

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
they're all equally red or yellow or

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.749 
they're all equally red or yellow or
whatever<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.520> if

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
whatever it is then you can do this if

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.060 
whatever it is then you can do this if
if<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> group<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> varying

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
if not if you have a group of varying

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.230 
if not if you have a group of varying
different<00:01:56.250> things<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> need<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.030> split

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
different things and you need to split

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.749 
different things and you need to split
them<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:58.170> take<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.500> photos<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.070> put

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
them up just take your photos and put

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.760 
them up just take your photos and put
them<00:01:59.880> in<00:01:59.969> different<00:02:00.000> folders<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.810> categorize

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
them in different folders and categorize

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
them in different folders and categorize
them<00:02:01.950> depending<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> light<00:02:02.820> values<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
them depending on the light values you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
them depending on the light values you
know<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.689> yellow<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.890> red<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.460> forth

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
know to yellow or to red and so forth

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.029 
know to yellow or to red and so forth
and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.509> correct<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.229> each<00:02:07.469> group

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and then you can correct to each group

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
and then you can correct to each group
of<00:02:08.220> photos<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.539> case<00:02:09.750> we're<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
of photos so in this case we're going to

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
of photos so in this case we're going to
correct<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:11.039> photos<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.670> are

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
correct all my photos here that are

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.360 
correct all my photos here that are
slightly<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.270> blue<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
slightly to blue to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.040 
slightly to blue to
incorrect<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.270> we<00:02:15.330> need<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.510> do<00:02:15.690> here<00:02:15.900> is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
incorrect so what we need to do here is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.500 
incorrect so what we need to do here is
a<00:02:16.110> pull<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.620> our<00:02:16.830> actions<00:02:17.340> palette<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:18.300> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
a pull up our actions palette if you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.940 
a pull up our actions palette if you
don't<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> window<00:02:19.800> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
don't have that up just go to window and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.760 
don't have that up just go to window and
actions<00:02:20.760> that'll<00:02:21.570> bring<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.410> we

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
actions that'll bring that up and now we

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.650 
actions that'll bring that up and now we
need<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.220> create<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.610> new<00:02:23.850> action<00:02:24.210> so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
need to just create a new action so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.210 
need to just create a new action so
we're<00:02:24.780> gonna<00:02:24.870> click<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.530> new<00:02:25.650> paper<00:02:25.980> icon

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
we're gonna click on a new paper icon

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.410 
we're gonna click on a new paper icon
here<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.940> we're<00:02:27.630> gonna<00:02:27.720> set<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.560> correct

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
here and we're gonna set this to correct

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.600 
here and we're gonna set this to correct
white<00:02:30.420> balance<00:02:30.450> WB<00:02:31.350> white<00:02:31.590> balance<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.280> I'm

white balance WB white balance and I'm

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.850 
white balance WB white balance and I'm
gonna<00:02:32.790> press<00:02:33.660> ENTER<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.380> gonna<00:02:34.560> start

recording now you notice that there's a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.210 
recording now you notice that there's a
stop<00:02:36.690> button<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.200> there's<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> record<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.100> the

every action that you do in Photoshop

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.950 
every action that you do in Photoshop
will<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.290> recorded<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.510> what<00:02:45.510> we're<00:02:45.660> gonna<00:02:45.750> do

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
will be recorded so what we're gonna do

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.080 
will be recorded so what we're gonna do
here<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.380> we're<00:02:46.530> gonna<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> image

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.930 

adjustments<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.380> variations<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:53.430> what

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
adjustments and variations now what

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.760 
adjustments and variations now what
we're<00:02:54.120> gonna<00:02:54.240> do<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:56.000> set<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:58.230> variation

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
we're gonna do here is set the variation

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.230 
we're gonna do here is set the variation
correct<00:02:59.130> now<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.880> I've<00:03:00.030> shown<00:03:00.210> you

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
correct now this this I've shown you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.490 
correct now this this I've shown you
before<00:03:00.360> how<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> create<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> white<00:03:01.320> balance

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
before how to create the white balance

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.980 
before how to create the white balance
right<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.460> we<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:02.790> original<00:03:03.330> image<00:03:03.570> here<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
right so we have original image here and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.560 
right so we have original image here and
our<00:03:04.620> current<00:03:04.950> pick<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.000> way<00:03:06.090> we<00:03:06.270> correct

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
our current pick and the way we correct

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.900 
our current pick and the way we correct
this<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.960> for<00:03:07.890> example<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.460> have<00:03:08.610> too<00:03:08.790> much

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
this is for example if we have too much

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.450 
this is for example if we have too much
blue<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.360> too<00:03:09.450> much<00:03:09.600> magenta<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.310> just

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
blue and too much magenta then we just

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.130 
blue and too much magenta then we just
need<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.000> opposite<00:03:12.360> go<00:03:12.630> across

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
need to think the opposite go across

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.800 
need to think the opposite go across
here<00:03:13.290> too<00:03:14.130> much<00:03:14.280> blue<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.240> add<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:15.630> green

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
here too much blue so you add more green

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.090 
here too much blue so you add more green
too<00:03:16.680> much<00:03:16.830> magenta<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.700> add<00:03:17.850> yellow<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
too much magenta and you add yellow and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.440 
too much magenta and you add yellow and
essentially<00:03:20.100> correct<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.940> photo<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.420> you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
essentially correct the photo so you

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.820 
essentially correct the photo so you
just<00:03:21.630> need<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> play<00:03:22.020> around<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
just need to play around with the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.290 
just need to play around with the
correcting<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.370> white<00:03:23.520> balance<00:03:23.700> first<00:03:24.060> of

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
correcting the white balance first of

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.090 
correcting the white balance first of
one<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:24.870> photos<00:03:25.110> right<00:03:25.440> over<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.890> group

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
one of your photos right over the group

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.950 
one of your photos right over the group
and<00:03:26.940> we're<00:03:27.090> gonna<00:03:27.180> click<00:03:27.450> OK

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
and we're gonna click OK

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.470 
and we're gonna click OK
we've<00:03:28.320> corrected<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:29.070> right<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.610> now<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.240> is

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
we've corrected that right so now it is

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.780 
we've corrected that right so now it is
to<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.750> correct<00:03:31.110> white<00:03:31.410> balance<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.130> we're

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
to the correct white balance so we're

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.000 
to the correct white balance so we're
just<00:03:32.820> need<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.120> press<00:03:33.330> stop<00:03:33.570> now<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.860> have

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
just need to press stop now and we have

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.580 
just need to press stop now and we have
essentially<00:03:35.460> our<00:03:35.820> correction<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.990> white

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
essentially our correction of white

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
essentially our correction of white
balance<00:03:38.150> action<00:03:39.150> saved<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.590> that's<00:03:40.800> done<00:03:41.070> so

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
balance action saved so that's done so
