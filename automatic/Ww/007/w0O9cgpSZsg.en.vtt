done you just flick the lever again and
it<00:00:31.740> closes<00:00:32.189> leaving<00:00:32.669> no<00:00:33.239> visible<00:00:33.750> trace<00:00:34.020> well

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it closes leaving no visible trace well

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
it closes leaving no visible trace well
apart<00:00:34.920> from<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.280> very<00:00:35.610> obvious<00:00:35.820> lever<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
apart from the very obvious lever of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.920 
apart from the very obvious lever of
course<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> something<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.930> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
course that there is something there so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470 
course that there is something there so
let's<00:00:40.590> head<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.670> tutorial<00:00:42.270> where

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I'll show you how to build this so what

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.029 
I'll show you how to build this so what
you're<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> put<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.170> piston<00:00:46.590> there

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you're gonna do is put your piston there

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.840 
you're gonna do is put your piston there
remember<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.610> floor<00:00:47.850> Heights<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
remember your floor Heights here and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
remember your floor Heights here and
that's<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.149> start<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.649> want

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that's the start and now you just want

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
that's the start and now you just want
to<00:00:52.949> create<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.460> four<00:00:54.360> by<00:00:54.629> two<00:00:55.230> rows<00:00:55.620> sticky

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to create a four by two rows sticky

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.970 
to create a four by two rows sticky
pistons<00:00:56.640> except<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
pistons except for this one which is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
pistons except for this one which is
knocked<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> create

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
knocked out and you just want to create

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.530 
knocked out and you just want to create
a<00:01:03.379> row<00:01:04.379> three<00:01:04.860> sticky<00:01:05.309> pistons<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
a row three sticky pistons here here and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.240 
a row three sticky pistons here here and
here<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.700> also<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:12.500> now<00:01:13.500> we

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
here and also one right here so now we

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
here and also one right here so now we
are<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.150> wire<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
are going to wire these up and the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.999 
are going to wire these up and the
wiring<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:21.060> nice<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:22.350> you've

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
wiring for them is pretty nice or you've

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.890 
wiring for them is pretty nice or you've
got<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> put<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> redstone<00:01:24.210> torch<00:01:24.330> there

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
got to do is put a redstone torch there

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.940 
got to do is put a redstone torch there
a<00:01:25.229> block<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:27.619> there<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:30.590> here<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a block there there there and here and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.649 
a block there there there and here and
you<00:01:33.049> put<00:01:34.049> another<00:01:34.500> redstone<00:01:34.860> torch<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:36.229> and

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
you put another redstone torch here and

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.530 
you put another redstone torch here and
redstone<00:01:39.659> dust<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.540> as

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
redstone dust here here and here and as

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.569 
redstone dust here here and here and as
you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.229> extends<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> Pistons

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you can see this extends all the Pistons

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.950 
you can see this extends all the Pistons
and<00:01:46.729> we'll<00:01:47.729> retract<00:01:48.210> them<00:01:48.360> once<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> turn<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and we'll retract them once you turn it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.090 
and we'll retract them once you turn it
off<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:55.100> get

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
off so now what you want to do is get

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
off so now what you want to do is get
your<00:01:56.250> bearing<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.009> get<00:01:59.280> two<00:02:00.240> hoppers

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
your bearing you want to get two hoppers

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.420 
your bearing you want to get two hoppers
and<00:02:01.670> point<00:02:02.670> them<00:02:02.850> into<00:02:03.329> each<00:02:03.450> other<00:02:03.689> by<00:02:04.140> using

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and point them into each other by using

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.449 
and point them into each other by using
shift-click<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:11.099> nice

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
shift-click and this is a really nice

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.820 
shift-click and this is a really nice
design<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.940> came<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.450> or

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
design I came up with or

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.310 
design I came up with or
an<00:02:13.890> adjustable<00:02:16.520> Jew<00:02:17.520> leg<00:02:17.700> trigger<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
an adjustable Jew leg trigger so you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.370 
an adjustable Jew leg trigger so you
just<00:02:19.500> want<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.710> put<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> comparators<00:02:20.700> they're

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
just want to put the comparators they're

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.760 
just want to put the comparators they're
actually<00:02:22.380> not<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.970> block<00:02:24.320> they're<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.500> there

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
actually not a block they're in there

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:37.850 
actually not a block they're in there
and<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.670> comparators<00:02:33.560> right<00:02:34.670> here<00:02:36.860> pointing

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and the comparators right here pointing

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:47.030 
and the comparators right here pointing
into<00:02:41.300> two<00:02:42.300> blocks<00:02:44.090> now<00:02:45.350> if<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.740> come<00:02:47.010> out

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
into two blocks now if you just come out

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.580 
into two blocks now if you just come out
here<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.120> put<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.630> row<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:51.590> like

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
here and put a row like that and like

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.949 
here and put a row like that and like
this<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:53.820> repeaters<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:59.510> roll

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
this with repeaters and I roll

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.110 
this with repeaters and I roll
redstone<00:03:03.260> what<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:06.260> go<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
redstone what you can do is go like that

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.699 
redstone what you can do is go like that
and<00:03:09.890> run<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> redstone<00:03:11.400> down<00:03:11.610> here<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.709> now

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
and run the redstone down here and now

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:23.360 
and run the redstone down here and now

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
you run the redstone down there and put

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.890 
you run the redstone down there and put
a<00:04:38.419> redstone<00:04:38.990> repeater<00:04:40.660> right<00:04:41.919> there<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.900> set

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
a redstone repeater right there and set

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.000 
a redstone repeater right there and set
it<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:46.900> four<00:04:47.900> ticks<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.620> then<00:04:49.610> another<00:04:49.970> one

dust there there and you want to put one

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.370 
dust there there and you want to put one
redstone<00:06:11.539> repeater<00:06:11.900> there<00:06:12.260> and<00:06:14.380> actually

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
redstone repeater there and actually

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.230 
redstone repeater there and actually
this<00:06:15.530> is<00:06:15.590> another<00:06:16.310> redstone<00:06:16.580> repeater<00:06:17.120> and

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
this is another redstone repeater and

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.980 
this is another redstone repeater and
like<00:06:18.020> that<00:06:18.470> and

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.440 

you<00:06:21.230> just<00:06:21.440> want<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.680> set<00:06:21.890> this<00:06:22.490> one<00:06:22.790> to<00:06:23.090> four

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
you just want to set this one to four

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.940 
you just want to set this one to four
ticks<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:27.010> that<00:06:28.010> should<00:06:28.310> work<00:06:28.520> pretty<00:06:28.790> well

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
ticks and that should work pretty well

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:38.129 
ticks and that should work pretty well
so<00:06:30.950> let's<00:06:31.460> give<00:06:31.640> it<00:06:31.670> a<00:06:31.820> spin

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.800 

I<00:06:38.199> missed<00:06:38.949> this<00:06:39.129> redstone<00:06:39.550> torch<00:06:39.999> right<00:06:40.270> here

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
I missed this redstone torch right here

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.939 
I missed this redstone torch right here
and<00:06:42.749> that<00:06:43.749> was<00:06:44.199> it

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949
