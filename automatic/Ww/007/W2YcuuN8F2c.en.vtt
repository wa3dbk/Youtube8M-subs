00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.550 
brushes I checked them they're fine it's
just<00:07:05.520> I<00:07:05.849> replaced<00:07:06.660> the<00:07:06.780> battery<00:07:07.139> thinking

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
just I replaced the battery thinking

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.510 
just I replaced the battery thinking
that<00:07:07.680> there<00:07:07.830> was<00:07:07.949> a<00:07:08.009> problem<00:07:08.370> with<00:07:08.430> the

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
that there was a problem with the

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.939 
that there was a problem with the
batteries<00:07:08.880> so<00:07:09.030> I<00:07:09.060> paid<00:07:09.360> 25<00:07:10.320> bucks<00:07:10.349> for<00:07:10.680> a<00:07:10.830> new

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
batteries so I paid 25 bucks for a new

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:17.719 
batteries so I paid 25 bucks for a new
battery<00:07:11.160> and<00:07:11.810> it<00:07:12.810> just<00:07:13.080> it<00:07:14.039> won't<00:07:14.160> go<00:07:14.340> so<00:07:16.729> this

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
battery and it just it won't go so this

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.279 
battery and it just it won't go so this
is<00:07:17.820> the<00:07:17.910> only<00:07:18.090> tool<00:07:18.449> that<00:07:18.660> was<00:07:18.720> passed<00:07:19.020> down<00:07:19.169> to

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:19.289 
is the only tool that was passed down to

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:21.589 
is the only tool that was passed down to
me<00:07:19.500> from<00:07:19.620> my<00:07:19.770> father<00:07:20.160> and<00:07:20.460> more<00:07:21.240> than<00:07:21.389> likely

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 
me from my father and more than likely

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.210 
me from my father and more than likely
he<00:07:21.960> used<00:07:22.169> it<00:07:22.380> like<00:07:23.070> this<00:07:24.320> more<00:07:25.320> than<00:07:25.500> like<00:07:25.680> this

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 
he used it like this more than like this

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.430 
he used it like this more than like this
so<00:07:26.760> more<00:07:27.360> than<00:07:27.510> likely<00:07:27.690> I'm<00:07:27.960> the<00:07:28.169> only<00:07:28.289> one

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.370 
so more than likely I'm the only one
