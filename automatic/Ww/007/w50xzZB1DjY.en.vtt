better said almost last but not least we
have<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.140> adapter<00:02:04.290> from<00:02:04.799> DVI<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.750> VGA<00:02:06.750> if

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
have a little adapter from DVI to VGA if

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.469 
have a little adapter from DVI to VGA if
anyone's<00:02:07.680> still<00:02:07.890> using<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:09.330> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
anyone's still using that and then we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.110 
anyone's still using that and then we
have<00:02:09.599> an<00:02:09.720> 8<00:02:09.869> pin<00:02:10.080> 2<00:02:10.349> 6<00:02:10.590> pin<00:02:10.830> adapter<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.849> also

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
have an 8 pin 2 6 pin adapter which also

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.430 
have an 8 pin 2 6 pin adapter which also
can<00:02:12.510> come<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:13.080> here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
can come in here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.310 
can come in here
in<00:02:13.680> case<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.910> not<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.870> graphics

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
in case you do not know this graphics

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.920 
in case you do not know this graphics
card<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:16.890> version<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.340> t9<00:02:17.640> 70<00:02:18.090> requires<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
card or this version of t9 70 requires a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.250 
card or this version of t9 70 requires a
6<00:02:19.290> pin<00:02:19.530> plus<00:02:20.070> an<00:02:20.220> 8<00:02:20.340> pin<00:02:20.550> power<00:02:20.760> connector<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
6 pin plus an 8 pin power connector so I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.770 
6 pin plus an 8 pin power connector so I
think<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.860> second<00:02:23.550> biggest<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.720> terms

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
think it's the second biggest in terms

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.580 
think it's the second biggest in terms
of<00:02:25.970> hungriness<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.270> terms<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.570> power<00:02:27.780> yeah

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of hungriness in terms of power yeah

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.910 
of hungriness in terms of power yeah
right<00:02:28.740> here<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> MSI<00:02:29.670> logo<00:02:29.910> which<00:02:30.300> is

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
right here we see the MSI logo which is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
right here we see the MSI logo which is
illuminated<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.700> shiny<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.300> bright<00:02:33.450> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the graphics card hits above 60 degrees

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.810 
the graphics card hits above 60 degrees
the<00:02:51.480> fans<00:02:51.750> will<00:02:51.960> spin<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.470> it's<00:02:52.710> below<00:02:52.920> 60

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.960 
spin at all which makes it an extremely
quiet<00:02:58.500> card<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.130> also<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.400> lot<00:02:59.520> more<00:02:59.790> easy

together but yeah I'm so right here you
can<00:03:17.670> see<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:18.030> gameplay<00:03:18.510> which<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.990> recorded

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
can see some gameplay which I recorded

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.580 
can see some gameplay which I recorded
with<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.130> shadow<00:03:20.490> play<00:03:21.200> while<00:03:22.200> recording

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
with the shadow play while recording

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.750 
with the shadow play while recording
software<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.160> could<00:03:23.280> call<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.610> it's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
software you could call it it's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.920 
software you could call it it's
basically<00:03:23.880> part<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.390> GeForce<00:03:24.870> experience

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
basically part of GeForce experience

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.350 
basically part of GeForce experience
that<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.590> get<00:03:25.709> with<00:03:25.920> any<00:03:26.100> GeForce<00:03:26.610> card<00:03:26.910> from

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
that you get with any GeForce card from

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.949 
that you get with any GeForce card from
the<00:03:27.810> 600<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.680> up<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.940> course<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.270> 970<00:03:30.780> has

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the 600 and up so of course the 970 has

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.560 
the 600 and up so of course the 970 has
that<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.410> well<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:32.280> course<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.209> same<00:03:33.360> with

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
that as well of course is the same with

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.930 
that as well of course is the same with
some<00:03:34.050> other<00:03:34.230> features<00:03:34.620> like<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.190> misc<00:03:35.520> super

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
some other features like the misc super

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.990 
some other features like the misc super

resolution the new TF ma you probably
already<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.690> because<00:03:39.990> this<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.320> like

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
already have that because this is like

I'm<00:03:48.720> playing<00:03:49.020> on<00:03:49.170> high<00:03:49.350> without<00:03:50.070> any

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
I'm playing on high without any

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.270 
I'm playing on high without any
anti-aliasing<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:52.260> normally<00:03:52.560> averaging

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
anti-aliasing and I'm normally averaging

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.860 
anti-aliasing and I'm normally averaging
about<00:03:53.600> 100<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.870> 110<00:03:55.620> frames<00:03:55.980> maybe<00:03:56.280> 120

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
about 100 to 110 frames maybe 120

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.010 
about 100 to 110 frames maybe 120
sometimes<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.080> dips<00:03:58.320> down<00:03:58.410> into<00:03:59.250> like<00:04:00.020> 7075

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
sometimes it dips down into like 7075

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.370 
sometimes it dips down into like 7075
but<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.860> also<00:04:02.190> get<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:02.550> like<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> max<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.690> 140

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
but I also get a like a max of 140

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.590 
but I also get a like a max of 140
frames<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.790> graphics<00:04:06.120> card<00:04:06.360> runs

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
frames so the graphics card runs

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.449 
frames so the graphics card runs
extremely<00:04:07.170> well<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.980> want<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> see<00:04:08.280> some

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
extremely well if you want to see some

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.250 
extremely well if you want to see some
more<00:04:08.610> games<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.270> recorded<00:04:09.600> with<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> game

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
more games that I recorded with the game

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260 
more games that I recorded with the game
or<00:04:10.560> with<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.130> graphics<00:04:11.459> card<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:11.850> can<00:04:12.180> of

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
or with the graphics card you can of

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.210 
or with the graphics card you can of
course<00:04:12.480> check<00:04:12.630> out<00:04:12.750> my<00:04:12.870> other<00:04:12.930> channel<00:04:13.050> or<00:04:13.470> one

I<00:04:16.890> think<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.160> crunch<00:04:17.400> off<00:04:17.520> for<00:04:17.669> now<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:18.060> case

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
I think it's crunch off for now in case

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.150 
I think it's crunch off for now in case
you<00:04:18.810> were<00:04:19.109> wondering<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.830> should<00:04:19.859> get<00:04:20.130> a

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
you were wondering if you should get a

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.560 
you were wondering if you should get a
new<00:04:20.310> graphics<00:04:20.669> card<00:04:20.730> I<00:04:21.000> will<00:04:21.239> definitely

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
new graphics card I will definitely

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.540 
new graphics card I will definitely
recommend<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:22.169> one<00:04:22.380> because<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.130> amazing

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
recommend this one because it is amazing

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.000 
recommend this one because it is amazing
but<00:04:24.300> yeah<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.870> once<00:04:25.350> again<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.770> think<00:04:25.830> it's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
but yeah and once again I think it's

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.260 
but yeah and once again I think it's
crunch<00:04:26.220> off<00:04:26.310> for<00:04:26.460> now<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:26.789> hope

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
crunch off for now so I hope

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.800 
crunch off for now so I hope
video<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.690> we'll<00:04:27.810> just<00:04:27.930> go<00:04:28.050> flick<00:04:28.229> her<00:04:28.349> out
