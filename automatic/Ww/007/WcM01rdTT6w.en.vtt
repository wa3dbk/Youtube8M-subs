00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
Hallo!

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.799
I'm starting new assembly.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.000
Maybe it will be divided into two stages.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.366
First: assembling and painting the figures.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:17.832
Second: the construction of a mini diorama idea while I will not disclose, because he is still not sure what I'll do.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:25.733
And now video review of a set of figurines of the Soviet assault group 1943-1945 from Zvezda

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:30.999
In a set of 6 figurines of soldiers with a height of about 5 centimeters.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.133
Kit contains 94 parts.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.299
Now separately about each figure.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:48.100
The first fighter is in the hands of the submachine gun system Sudaeva, on the breast a steel breastplate.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:58.033
The second fighter: sitting on your lap, in the hands of heavy machine gun Goryunova, also contains an ammo box.

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:06.466
The third fighter is in the hands knapsack flamethrower Klyuev â€” Sergeev

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:12.799
Fourth soldier: crawling, in the left hand submachine gun system Sudaeva,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.166
and the right binoculars. On chest steel breastplate.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:29.966
Fifth fighter stands on the knee, in the hands of the submachine gun system Shpagina, on chest steel breastplate

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:36.232
Sixth fighter is on his knees, in his left hand a submachine gun Shpagina, 

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:43.299
right tightens the ammunition-box, on chest steel breastplate

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.600
Now on to the contents of the box.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.600
And so what we have inside:

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.233
Manual on one folded sheet in half.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:02:05.566
Shows how to assemble each solder, with the mind all clear, no problems should arise.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:24.399
On another side the painting scheme and a brief historical background.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.700
All kit is located on two sprues. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.133
Good detail, the fin mostly on large parts.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:36.166
Small parts are cast well.

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:57.299
At the end of the video are pictures of the sprues, you can see the detail of the kit.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:05.633
Also in the box is a bonus, a small jar brand glue.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:16.366
Should be interesting, figurines I have never assembled and painted yet.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:18.766
That's it.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:22.099

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:44.266
