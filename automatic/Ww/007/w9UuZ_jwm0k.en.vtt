00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.130
 so expensive 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.660
 hello and welcome to what has been said i know it's only i you 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.299
 thank you for giving them names 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.909
 today I'm going to talk to you about a game that is practiced in schools of 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.079
 fox is in the weak it's about the hawk takes the air 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.679
 it's a game that works fundamentals and that helps 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.739
 develop individual and collective strategies of 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.560
 displacement 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.039
 let's see in detail the principle that the regulation the paintings 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.810
 is a game that is practiced in the field to the three zones 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.199
 the cramped area on the camps reserved for that was dressed up and the 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.800
 area from the land owned by hunters 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 in a real situation, they are hicks that delimit the zones 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.620
 the game starts with a hunter and red hicham who does not have the right to 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.370
 get out of his area and a group of converted vocal riders and zone 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 to zone 3 which is so on for several rounds the goal of the game 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.370
 for the hawks pedaling in zone 3 without being touched by the or 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.620
 the hunters 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.070
 the goal of the game for the hunter is to touch the maximum of permits at each 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.750
 tower 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.130
 each time a keyboard hit the next turn he becomes a hunter in the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.970
 middle zone in addition to the first hunter 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.040
 the game is over when there is only one state left 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.400
 this one is thus designated winner and becomes the hunter of the part 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.000
 next 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 if a stall of the rise of the land boundary he becomes a hunter in the turn 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.880
 following 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.200
 if a state of a fall in his zone in the central zone he becomes 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.510
 hunter on the next turn to facilitate play when there is almost no 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.870
 detailed information, some hunters may be asked to stand by the arm without 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.480
 to let go 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.960
 you will understand it the csa it has the advantage to allow all of joy 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 All the time 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.049
 unlike all the elimination authors he had however to 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.880
 the spirit of adapting the size of the land where the number of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 participants for beginners for example it is better to have a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.789
 smaller pitch to avoid speeding up which could lead to 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.250
 more violent falls 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.140
 it is possible if to adopt the regulation with certain variants that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.570
 allows to work specific techniques for example to forbid 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.040
 hunters touching a hawk that is on a foot or doing well 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.490
 who drive in reverse 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.600
