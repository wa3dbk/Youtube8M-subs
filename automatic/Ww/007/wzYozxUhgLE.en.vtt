00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.240
 today there is a ballmit with 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.650
 Goal shot and we lay especially today 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.389
 the value on the clean 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.619
 execution at the gate and because 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.710
 Ball lugging in the movement always 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:22.910
 the right and fit but the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.539
 inside ripley day only twice 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.880
 touch the forest, not once says 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:34.160
 12 it run 12 and pastor had 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.520
 again on technology process if then 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.520
 back up 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.399
 more who have more about Jacob more 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.809
 Survey the time has the muster 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.809
 foot is everything left 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:04.120
 yes there lies the third you see june 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.120
 take right over it back left 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.000
 a bit across because it should 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.220
 do not do that they push here 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.820
 says and then forward because then run 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.000
 the success against opponents on those 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.250
 aground 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:30.380
 Zack zack goes over it 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:32.060
 back over and over back 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.440
 pull yes, I'll go july 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.460
 Turn it over again 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.460
 but remember 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:59.780
 just has it over so presses 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.229
 fit and go back again and fits 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.229
 clean if he does not go over 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.269
 only so, but really 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.269
 next to the whole foot with it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:31.819
 suppressed left foot over it says 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.380
 Forget the cash and play at the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.390
 At the first station we start moving 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.040
 make two shots then find play 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.750
 the ball to the second station being mine 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.060
 because it's just important that we have the ball 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.380
 not from the out of the stand 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.790
 because they do not play in the game 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.319
 so happens in a free kick 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.239
 that's why I want it all in 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.160
 The movement then goes to the second 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.650
 Station I want that ball directly 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.850
 if possible that is played 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.410
 actually works in a big way and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.239
 whole and always so directly to 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.280
 next station that he has the ball in the 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.220
 Movement can take you up to speed 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.260
 a movement or a ballmitnahme 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.850
 and then when it comes to the goal shoot 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.590
 if not then just a second 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.930
 But there is the clean assumption begs 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.760
 the clean take- along just that once 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.530
 high and then just the clean one 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.290
 Goal shot with the right execution 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.290
 right leg and pull through 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.049
 Whether a ball is not over the gate 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.189
 absolutely crucial if the back 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.629
 to the rear or to the back 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.189
 Leaned or not has, of course 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.459
 already to do with but above all 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.200
 It is crucial if I shot this 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.900
 knee in available 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.969
 so no matter here and I close the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.650
 kneels and gets and ball then he comes 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.599
 then he does not go upstairs 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.549
 but of course I am here and 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.620
 then shoots as the knee is behind the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.480
 ball then goes up often 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.769
 that is a decisive factor 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.310
 Of course, when I go back 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.280
 go 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.980
 but it is crucial that the knee 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.400
 Exercise ball in the shot then he goes 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.400
 not up
