00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620 
problem because there is so many chests
and<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:52.200> only<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.790> get

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and not only that is that you can get

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.959 
and not only that is that you can get
every<00:01:54.960> single<00:01:55.079> chest<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.740> EV<00:01:55.890> all<00:01:56.790> your

every single chest on EV all your

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.969 
every single chest on EV all your
characters<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.259> don't<00:01:58.469> get<00:01:58.619> lucky

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
characters so if you don't get lucky

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.350 
characters so if you don't get lucky
with<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> character<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.180> gear
