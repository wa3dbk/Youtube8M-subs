00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
you had already picked up so I think

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.070 
you had already picked up so I think
that's<00:05:24.760> gonna<00:05:24.880> be<00:05:25.030> an<00:05:25.120> awesome<00:05:25.270> brand<00:05:25.990> new

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
that's gonna be an awesome brand new

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.990 
that's gonna be an awesome brand new
feature<00:05:26.290> in<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.650> game<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.130> the<00:05:27.160> other

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
feature in the game and the other

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.100 
feature in the game and the other
feature<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.390> they're<00:05:28.660> adding<00:05:28.930> for<00:05:29.080> the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
feature that they're adding for the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.740 
feature that they're adding for the
mobility<00:05:29.590> aspect<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.310> you<00:05:31.120> can<00:05:31.300> slide

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
mobility aspect is that you can slide

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.620 
mobility aspect is that you can slide
and<00:05:32.230> it's<00:05:32.860> kind<00:05:33.100> of<00:05:33.190> sort<00:05:34.000> of<00:05:34.120> similar<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.480> a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
and it's kind of sort of similar to a

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.900 
and it's kind of sort of similar to a
dolphin<00:05:35.080> dive<00:05:35.230> but<00:05:35.650> it's<00:05:36.160> a<00:05:36.280> slide<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.790> I

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
dolphin dive but it's a slide and I

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.860 
dolphin dive but it's a slide and I
think<00:05:37.120> that's<00:05:37.240> going<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.420> really<00:05:37.600> improve

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
think that's going to really improve

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.659 
think that's going to really improve
drop<00:05:38.260> shotting<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.800> make<00:05:38.920> drop<00:05:39.250> shotting<00:05:39.520> a

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
drop shotting and make drop shotting a

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.490 
drop shotting and make drop shotting a
lot<00:05:39.880> more<00:05:40.060> effective<00:05:40.450> in<00:05:40.540> this<00:05:40.630> game<00:05:40.810> if<00:05:40.960> you

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
lot more effective in this game if you

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.870 
lot more effective in this game if you
can<00:05:41.680> actually<00:05:42.040> shoot<00:05:42.310> when<00:05:42.550> you're<00:05:42.669> sliding

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
can actually shoot when you're sliding

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.270 
can actually shoot when you're sliding
so<00:05:43.540> I<00:05:43.570> think<00:05:43.690> that's<00:05:43.930> going<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.110> be<00:05:44.230> cool<00:05:44.440> I'm

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
so I think that's going to be cool I'm

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.060 
so I think that's going to be cool I'm
gonna<00:05:45.460> link<00:05:45.730> both<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.180> trailer<00:05:46.660> and<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.320> IGN

in previous Call of Duty's

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.300 
in previous Call of Duty's
you'll<00:06:37.900> be<00:06:38.110> able<00:06:38.200> to<00:06:38.350> like<00:06:38.620> put<00:06:38.860> your<00:06:38.980> own

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
character to look like is how he's gonna

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.760 
character to look like is how he's gonna
look<00:06:44.230> like<00:06:44.410> and<00:06:44.650> I<00:06:45.250> think<00:06:45.550> that<00:06:45.930> maybe<00:06:46.930> even<00:06:47.470> if

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
look like and I think that maybe even if

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.530 
look like and I think that maybe even if
they<00:06:47.890> decide<00:06:48.250> to<00:06:48.280> go<00:06:48.520> beyond<00:06:48.910> call<00:06:49.300> duty

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
they decide to go beyond call duty

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.780 
they decide to go beyond call duty
ghosts<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.050> the<00:06:50.140> future<00:06:50.530> for<00:06:51.160> future<00:06:51.460> call<00:06:51.670> of

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790

duty's<00:06:52.060> if<00:06:53.020> if<00:06:53.410> they<00:06:53.650> develop<00:06:54.010> like<00:06:54.220> a<00:06:54.250> girl

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
duty's if if they develop like a girl

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.070 
duty's if if they develop like a girl
character<00:06:55.120> I<00:06:55.300> think<00:06:55.660> that'd<00:06:55.780> be<00:06:55.960> awesome

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
character I think that'd be awesome

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.540 
character I think that'd be awesome
because<00:06:56.380> we<00:06:56.560> haven't<00:06:56.830> really<00:06:56.950> seen<00:06:57.220> that<00:06:57.280> in

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
because we haven't really seen that in

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.180 
because we haven't really seen that in
call<00:06:57.760> duty<00:06:58.110> thus<00:06:59.110> far<00:06:59.320> I<00:06:59.380> mean<00:06:59.680> I<00:06:59.800> think<00:06:59.830> we've

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
call duty thus far I mean I think we've

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.190 
call duty thus far I mean I think we've
seen<00:07:00.400> like<00:07:00.790> a<00:07:00.820> few<00:07:01.120> people<00:07:01.690> in<00:07:01.780> the<00:07:01.840> campaign

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.200 
seen like a few people in the campaign

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.840 
seen like a few people in the campaign
that<00:07:02.410> are<00:07:02.530> girls<00:07:02.710> or<00:07:02.950> something<00:07:03.280> but<00:07:03.490> our<00:07:03.610> side

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
that are girls or something but our side

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.880 
that are girls or something but our side
characters<00:07:04.360> but<00:07:05.020> if<00:07:05.170> you<00:07:05.290> can<00:07:05.440> actually<00:07:05.740> be<00:07:05.860> a

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
characters but if you can actually be a

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.400 
characters but if you can actually be a
girl<00:07:06.430> character<00:07:06.970> and<00:07:07.210> customize<00:07:08.050> between<00:07:08.380> a

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
girl character and customize between a

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.470 
girl character and customize between a
male<00:07:08.590> and<00:07:08.650> a<00:07:08.800> female<00:07:08.830> in<00:07:09.400> multiplayer<00:07:10.060> I<00:07:10.150> think

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.480 
male and a female in multiplayer I think

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.670 
male and a female in multiplayer I think
that<00:07:10.570> would<00:07:10.660> be<00:07:10.750> a<00:07:10.780> really<00:07:10.990> cool<00:07:11.260> option<00:07:11.560> as

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
that would be a really cool option as

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.590 
that would be a really cool option as
