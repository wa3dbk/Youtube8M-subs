00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.889
 in the same line he faces a request to talk about them 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.310
 different types of interviews but 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 process of your message 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.789
 and it is that all the interviews 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.820
 it means there is nothing that is weird surprising unless 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.179
 constantly affect their morale their 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.999
 although he estimated his dignity one has been prepared so that everything can happen 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.480
 I explain one can not be 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 a young person apparently inexperienced as efficient the company 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.679
 and in the intermediate 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.740
 was interviewing the HR managers who approached their hands 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.090
 Unbeaten lpgc that the parents followed mentioned that they would be the super 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.590
 subordinates 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.980
 even in some companies I've even heard that he interviewed the futures 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.070
 customers 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.520
 in moral and anyone I interviewed is good first of all it remains task 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.770
 our best intention to cause our best image and we feel 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.280
 uncomfortable or mortified why will not be interviewed in that we do not get 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.199
 at your level 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.769
 we represent csi we feel that we are or only for centrist by some young 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.700
 Inverse John, we feel we are too young to be interviewed. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.260
 many more children 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.690
 another important thing to know in an interview is that many types of 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.380
 interest 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.020
 in restructured structures can be one to one strawberries two against 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 one 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.260
 ten against one can be group and ready nn gg of people who are interviewed 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.800
 in groups of 5 is always competing for a position interviewed 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.110
 June a panel 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.360
 which is like a little strange medium but 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.250
 pasalic and the legitimate there are others where the weight very pleasant so at the same time that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.220
 one was relaxing, pulling, repeating, saying things that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 I better have said 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 or on the contrary aggressive interviews where so in which one feels 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.500
 uncomfortable 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.470
 that one had to express what they want to see is how one handles how 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.550
 handles a likewise those situations 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.830
 and how it behaves there are formal interviews in formal companies offices 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.920
 on paper 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.810
 Informal interviews between Franz of even invite the family 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.680
 next to the children to see what their level of education treatment is like 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.090
 I know that for those heights you should be thinking it's not fair one is 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.909
 well well it should not be 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.849
 but in the real world everything happens an interviewer wants to know that 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.069
 person who is going to have the responsibility of a position 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.389
 important 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.389
 an equally important in different facets heÃ©nin different environments 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:31.309
 therefore it is legitimate is valid today ktm not to be surprised try not to 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:35.099
 bother near we have are at a level of vice ministers siegel 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.969
 interviewing is surprising or the format is not what you expected 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.459
 why 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.929
 that will make your chances of causing the best impression and 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.909
 and make it clear that you are the best 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.170
 before as soon as possible then all the interviews and the best of luck 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.559
 thanks bye
