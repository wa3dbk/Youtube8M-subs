00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
I'm saying the right thing about f1

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.030 
I'm saying the right thing about f1
racers<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.840> neck<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
racers so here we go the neck is a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
racers so here we go the neck is a
caramelized<00:01:14.640> wood<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.420> been<00:01:15.630> over<00:01:16.020> killed

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
caramelized wood it's been over killed

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
caramelized wood it's been over killed
for<00:01:16.590> stability<00:01:16.880> there's<00:01:17.880> less<00:01:18.150> moisture<00:01:18.390> in

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
for stability there's less moisture in

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
for stability there's less moisture in
this<00:01:19.229> neck<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.030> an<00:01:21.390> added<00:01:21.920> overkill<00:01:22.920> if

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this neck but as an added overkill if

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
this neck but as an added overkill if
you<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.090> somebody<00:01:24.479> who<00:01:24.659> travels<00:01:25.140> from

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you will for somebody who travels from

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
you will for somebody who travels from
somewhere<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.920> Costa<00:01:26.369> Rica<00:01:26.640> straight<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
somewhere like Costa Rica straight up to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
somewhere like Costa Rica straight up to
to<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.880> Greenland<00:01:31.159> with<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.430> those

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to you know to Greenland with all those

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.270 
to you know to Greenland with all those
extreme<00:01:33.420> changes<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.619> needed<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> guitar<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
extreme changes we needed a guitar that

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.850 
extreme changes we needed a guitar that
was<00:01:35.520> super<00:01:35.909> super<00:01:36.060> super<00:01:36.390> stable<00:01:36.750> neck<00:01:37.619> wise

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
was super super super stable neck wise

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
was super super super stable neck wise
and<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> put<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:38.970> graphite<00:01:39.420> rods<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.900> here

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and so we put two graphite rods in here

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.450 
and so we put two graphite rods in here
as<00:01:40.170> well<00:01:40.460> high<00:01:41.460> contrast<00:01:42.740> inlays<00:01:43.740> that's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
as well high contrast inlays that's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.440 
as well high contrast inlays that's
basically<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.090> maple<00:01:45.899> dot<00:01:46.140> within<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.240> evony<00:01:48.240> dot

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
basically a maple dot within a evony dot

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.090 
basically a maple dot within a evony dot
that<00:01:48.689> gives<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> contrast

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that gives it a little bit of contrast

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.620 
that gives it a little bit of contrast
on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> fingerboard<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> dark

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
on the fingerboard when you have a dark

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.850 
on the fingerboard when you have a dark
fingerboard<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.740> maple

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
fingerboard like that and you have maple

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.109 
fingerboard like that and you have maple
dots<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.399> kind<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> disappear<00:01:55.280> again<00:01:56.280> we

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
dots they kind of disappear again we

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
dots they kind of disappear again we
have<00:01:57.240> our<00:01:57.360> own<00:01:57.390> pick<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.229> are<00:01:58.409> wound

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
have our own pick up so these are wound

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.039
