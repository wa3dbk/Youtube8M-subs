00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.869
 minutes all these days preceding 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.329
 first term conductor's baton 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.099
 it's pounds 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.759
 vysotsky wall so happen that he 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.759
 why so long Chechnya 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.830
 but 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.960
 I 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 I 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.270
 b 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.900
 but 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 square 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 m calculations 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.690
 to children 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.070
 means 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 this percentage of theater plans 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.400
 I mean 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.630
 best stage work 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.870
 but I don't lose things 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.180
 she will only grow stronger on them 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.910
 Here I am 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.799
 this is unique content 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.799
 the minister said she 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.660
 any textbook on the history of Russian 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.080
 eighteenth century music 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.600
 you can read that Russian oil 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.670
 companies like strange 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.700
 one of the most significant 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 works of that time 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 meanwhile his song will become modern 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.590
 revision which differs markedly from 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 responsibility 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.620
 idea to execute this crime 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.370
 belongs to the category appeared in the area 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.060
 artistic director 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.280
 unique orchestras in red 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280
 color a few years ago 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.989
 this is the most team girl approached 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.989
 much earlier 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.429
 well than you were in deep childhood 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.469
 but I thought there was a record like that 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.329
 Russian music was called 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.139
 eighteenth century and there were recorded 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.809
 fragments from Russia 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.429
 not in full orchestra 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.129
 a reduced few 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.499
 of tools 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:41.719
 when just started 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.259
 make music into something forgot sansi 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.149
 question of Nikita symphonic 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.979
 scores why it doesn't sound original 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.839
 and then for many years we went to 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.029
 An orchestra appeared on historical 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.259
 instruments that this score could 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.839
 to master 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.709
 faith 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.409
 besides infrastructure 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.739
 the account is shared with microprocessors 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.869
 service besides that harder 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:09.659
 not easy fate 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.719
 extradition consciousness 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.689
 seventeenth century was taken to put 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.919
 the name of the playwright will move the threads 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.650
 music 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.380
 and therefore we begin our story with the alleged 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.780
 Borisovich princess on the authors of the project 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.780
 Russia 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.259
 he was born in 1740 avant-garde at school and 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.600
 that big place of officials 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.680
 the origin of wealth means 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.660
 allowed to start outwardly but get 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.389
 brilliant education 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.389
 in an academic gymnasium 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.789
 fluent French and 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.979
 German and later Tyumen 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.889
 consisted of translators office buildings 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.779
 not yet transferred to military service 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.019
 post of German secretary by the way 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.329
 Field Marshal General Razumovsky 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.099
 later 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.019
 so for 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.430
 opened before the princess unenviable 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.229
 career prospects 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.629
 but instead 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.619
 completely different 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:07.479
 From memories Nikolay Valuev 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.509
 officials 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.580
 Yakov Borisovich wrote a lot 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.659
 and the most serious poems 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.659
 ahead of that 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.139
 the princessâ€™s social circle was real 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.090
 the champion of Russian writers in addition 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.750
 time sumarokov novikov yesterday 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.610
 police officers 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.949
 in the same years of the book salon dangerous 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.949
 hydrometeorological actions by pirates 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.159
 by the mouth of my characters I first 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.279
 news so that the apparatus is financial 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.279
 pyramid 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:10.089
 before 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:12.569
 while abstaining should be attributed 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.309
 government funds I can hardly percentage of them 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:18.670
 relatives 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.670
 a 1 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.159
 but fate turned out to be favorable 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.430
 and he was saved by his patron 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.309
 to the lower former nobility 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:33.979
 conduct mining 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.229

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.059
 only four years later was at least 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:56.960
 appointed captain for 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.289
 and the students book house food is indicated 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.770
 and in 1785 was first published 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770
 text of the program alexey i'm not used to 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.090
 simultaneously demonstrate it 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.460
 out of action canvas 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.460
 at the same time it is dramatic 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.460
 action Tula Thursday 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.159
 percent on time is not the same 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.339
 it really was pupils 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.050
 if cars 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.059
 at 1915 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:28.210
 do i need to understand 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.210
 delays 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.659
 not excluded 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:37.189
 leave alone 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.099
 so for example percentage points 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.319
 not yet 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.949
 pounds primate 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:44.949
 European Commissioner Dahl 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.939
 to say exactly 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:51.860
 and because housing Russia 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.110
 or they set alone 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.610
 so we will not be cleaner
