00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.710
 we have until now a producer like

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.760

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.190

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.729

 charged 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.340
 Chestnut forests are forests 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.520
 mature have their dynamics already well 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.120
 established where each tree each 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.810
 animal does not have its function in this 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.470
 ecosystem 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.199
 so if we start to extract trees 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.139
 of this ecosystem we are just going to 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.810
 start to disturb that dynamic 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.729
 interesting that there is no there and the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.949
 table that has been given so far aa 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.050
 coexisted with the chestnut long ago 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.930
 time if the social issue is important 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.759
 but I think if we want to have forests 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.770
 of chestnut not only today but from here in 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.690
 the next 10 20 or 50 years 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.039
 we need to take a little more 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.070
 time to assess what it is that is 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:11.319
 happening in reality

 Congratulations sign design are something 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.800
 of 168 trees that are producing in 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.440
 which we are evaluating in 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.590
 the production per tree how much produces 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.980
 when weighing the barricade how much 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.980
 counting 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.069
 and then in the second stage we're going to 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.069
 be doing what is the census 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.100
 a little more to that we go 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:22.430
 and of this intensity 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:29.640
 is a light city established by

 nobel the impact of this negative effect 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.740

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.470
 these are water and win of the organism

 take that we sing production nike the

 peasant and where the activity 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.240
 interesting 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.240
 these are with win win the situation 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:54.970
 60 minimum but I will pass I think is what 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.610
 more important to establish the criteria 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.590
 technical and therefore in terms 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.300
 normative what would be the requirements 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.560
 what a person should meet to 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.110
 take advantage of wood inside a 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.970
 Spanish we need to have information 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.650
 of what is happening and what 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.380
 what can we do for the future 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.450
 so if we have results from the 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.190
 research we will know what we can do 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.190
 and when is it affecting chestnut
