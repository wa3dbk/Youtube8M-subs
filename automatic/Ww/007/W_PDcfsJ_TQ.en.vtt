00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
 good 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.650
 the necessary materials will be 27 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.960
 popsicle sticks 3 barbecue sticks 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.000
 and a white glue 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.710
 and then youtube, so I know it 's the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.560
 fifth video I'm recording 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.579
 state is looking strong at the then 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.600
 It says it's useful and I'm not going there , everything's normal. 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.520
 good 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.520
 so I came back today wanting to assert 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.750
 said artur Jorge, who is the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.420
 Paraguay 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.960
 My original I lost so far because of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.929
 one hour I think we make videos 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.920
 So this is what you 're going to do here. 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:00.649
 but the shape of the 1 so glue that the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.250
 enem format with three planets and a half 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.900
 bad to show you if you are seeing 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 stick glue tenacious remembering what makes 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.460
 all with a popsicle stick two 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.790
 planets that classic pro bank but I know 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.310
 Can you make something else? 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.440
 so here after you did and did 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.390
 this is right here 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.630
 if you can do it like that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.150
 Putting five of you there will give you the same 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.200
 thing one can see men width 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.930
 tomorrow I'll do it here, remembering that here 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 Is the photo in a number not easy? 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:47.030
 accept to vote those of 5 there or that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 nor so 3d will do the 3 1 soon after 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.980
 the computer and soon after I'm going to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.110
 middlemen so tava 1234 right here 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.810
 I left an inch of the way 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.210
 However I came back two four six 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:10.729
 eight sticks sir so I used 8 and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.459
 plus three of five will paste the child 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.519
 it's 123 after they've been rescued 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.610
 there is something and leaves a 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.400
 comment I answer is not 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.440
 showing the bank will look like this - 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.460
 I woke up with the tape here because he 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.880
 it broke 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:36.140
 just to show producer now and at the same time 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:41.800
 so this one you're going to do so goes 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.500
 get one so it will stick in the middle so 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.150
 of another half so goes formal 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.170
 The bank legs are going to make you two. 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.690
 Sometimes only this one here 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.670
 Then you're going to put on that circus of 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:02.420
 Before, remember here that this is going to be here. 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:07.400
 Also the base and then after circus 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.740
 that will put the legs that in those five 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.590
 so here too and so on 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.450
 then just stick a little toothpick up here 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.030
 You're seeing not understand and know right will 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.580
 be formed here the basis of it then neither 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.300
 you go more than orkla creativity 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.830
 made them so easy to keep in the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.480
 tip 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.080
 if he wants I can not jump 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.080
 with him 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.530
 look there format that it is the original is 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.810
 more up here then thereafter you 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.270
 can thus make the boot two halves that 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:50.270
 Up and a straight here will stay 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.600
 Right here is a square bench if 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.580
 more to light it today 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.640
 so if you do not understand a broad thing and 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.700
 sorry for the first video word software 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.030
 For me, this third commenter yes and 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.060
 Channel got really bad for the victim is everything 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.280
 improve and help the channel forget the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.330
 a light xenon 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.330
 so this is good, thanks
