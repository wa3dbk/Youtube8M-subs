think it'll be great for the springtime

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
think it'll be great for the springtime
in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> summertime<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.720> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> heavy

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
in the summertime or it's kind of heavy

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.859 
in the summertime or it's kind of heavy
so<00:01:49.530> i'm<00:01:49.590> guessing<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.950> springtime<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.840> i

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so i'm guessing the springtime but i

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
so i'm guessing the springtime but i
