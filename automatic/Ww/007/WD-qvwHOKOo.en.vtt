again<00:03:42.209> we're<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.570> exactly<00:03:42.900> sure<00:03:43.079> why<00:03:43.440> someone

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
again we're not exactly sure why someone

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500 
again we're not exactly sure why someone
would<00:03:43.980> use<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.549> over<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> Android

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
would use this over the Android

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.539 
would use this over the Android
Marketplace<00:03:45.930> because<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.590> says<00:03:46.739> far<00:03:47.250> fewer

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
Marketplace because this says far fewer

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.340 
Marketplace because this says far fewer
apps<00:03:47.790> only<00:03:48.000> about<00:03:48.269> four<00:03:48.570> thousand<00:03:49.019> at<00:03:49.140> lunch

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
apps only about four thousand at lunch

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.470 
apps only about four thousand at lunch
something<00:03:50.340> else<00:03:50.459> forgot<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.910> mention<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.329> can

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
something else forgot to mention we can

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.170 
something else forgot to mention we can
drill<00:03:51.750> down<00:03:51.930> into<00:03:52.200> particular<00:03:53.130> categories<00:03:53.880> if

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
drill down into particular categories if

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.810
