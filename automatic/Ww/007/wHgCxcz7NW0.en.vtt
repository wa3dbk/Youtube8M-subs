00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
on the other side a lot of times I

on the other side a lot of times I
always<00:02:36.349> fool<00:02:36.739> with<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.099> scissors<00:02:37.459> because

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
always fool with the scissors because

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.270 
always fool with the scissors because

you have to hold them in a weird
direction<00:02:40.629> when<00:02:41.629> you<00:02:41.659> do<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.170> other

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
direction when you do it on the other

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.899 
direction when you do it on the other
side<00:02:42.560> one<00:02:42.799> side<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.159> a<00:02:43.189> little<00:02:43.519> easier<00:02:43.849> than

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
side one side is a little easier than

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.789 
side one side is a little easier than
the<00:02:44.120> other<00:02:44.390> but<00:02:44.659> when<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.109> used<00:02:45.379> to<00:02:45.530> doing

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
the other but when you get used to doing

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.699 
the other but when you get used to doing
it<00:02:46.150> you'll<00:02:47.150> very<00:02:47.420> easily<00:02:47.689> flip<00:02:48.109> your<00:02:48.319> scissors

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
it you'll very easily flip your scissors

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.119 
it you'll very easily flip your scissors
and<00:02:48.950> cut<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.689> the<00:02:50.840> other<00:02:51.019> side<00:02:51.129> so

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129
