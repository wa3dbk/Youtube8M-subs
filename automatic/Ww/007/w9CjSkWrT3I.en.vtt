gunfights is to know when to aim down

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
gunfights is to know when to aim down
sight<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> shoot<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> hip<00:00:59.910> now

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sight and when to shoot from the hip now

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
sight and when to shoot from the hip now
this<00:01:00.840> works<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.980> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
this works really well because if you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
this works really well because if you
can<00:01:02.250> damage<00:01:02.520> an<00:01:02.760> enemy<00:01:03.120> before<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.539> has<00:01:03.780> time

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
can damage an enemy before he has time

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
can damage an enemy before he has time
to<00:01:04.110> aim<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.460> easily<00:01:05.610> win

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to aim then you can really easily win

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
to aim then you can really easily win
that<00:01:06.210> gunfight<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.770> enemy

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that gunfight so if you see an enemy

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
that gunfight so if you see an enemy
close<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.549> start<00:01:09.360> shooting<00:01:09.720> first<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.590> aim

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
close by start shooting first then aim

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.890 
close by start shooting first then aim
now<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.640> you're<00:01:11.850> doing<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.600> sure<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
now as you're doing this make sure that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600 
now as you're doing this make sure that
you<00:01:13.020> continue<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> move<00:01:13.830> towards<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> player

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you continue to move towards the player

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
you continue to move towards the player
so<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> aiming<00:01:15.570> becomes<00:01:15.930> easier<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so that aiming becomes easier for you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
so that aiming becomes easier for you
now<00:01:17.280> immittance<00:01:17.729> even<00:01:18.000> better<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.540> you're

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
now immittance even better if you're

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.780 
now immittance even better if you're
already<00:01:19.170> aiming<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.950> shooting<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> get

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
already aiming on shooting but you get

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
already aiming on shooting but you get
really<00:01:21.090> close<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:22.020> stop<00:01:22.439> aiming<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> start

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
really close then stop aiming and start

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.070 
really close then stop aiming and start
to<00:01:23.400> shoot<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> hip<00:01:23.850> again<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to shoot from the hip again now this

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
to shoot from the hip again now this
might<00:01:25.290> sound<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> bad<00:01:25.890> idea<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
might sound like a bad idea but this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.520 
might sound like a bad idea but this
will<00:01:27.150> keep<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.479> alive<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.380> move

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
will keep you alive because you can move

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
will keep you alive because you can move
much<00:01:28.799> faster<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> hipfire<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.360> makes

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
much faster when you hipfire which makes

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
much faster when you hipfire which makes
winning<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> close-quarters<00:01:31.439> gunfight<00:01:32.040> much

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
winning a close-quarters gunfight much

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.760 
winning a close-quarters gunfight much
easier<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.659> might<00:01:33.990> sound<00:01:34.170> quite<00:01:34.500> hard

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
easier now that might sound quite hard

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
easier now that might sound quite hard
to<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.909> need<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> remember<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to do but all you need to remember is

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
to do but all you need to remember is
that<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> player<00:01:37.590> who<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.740> close<00:01:38.070> by

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that if you see a player who is close by

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.399 
that if you see a player who is close by
start<00:01:39.180> shooting<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> hip<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.020> then

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
start shooting from the hip and then

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
start shooting from the hip and then
pull<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.829> gun<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.030> too

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
pull your gun up but if you get too

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
pull your gun up but if you get too
close<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:43.049> start<00:01:43.439> hip<00:01:43.649> firing<00:01:43.950> again<00:01:44.220> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
close then start hip firing again so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
close then start hip firing again so
that<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.180> move<00:01:45.329> faster<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.350> next

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that you can move faster now the next

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
that you can move faster now the next
way<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> win<00:01:47.159> more<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.520> gunfights<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
way to win more of your gunfights is to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
way to win more of your gunfights is to
walk<00:01:48.990> instead<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.619> running<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
walk instead of running now this is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.160 
walk instead of running now this is
something<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.090> I've<00:01:51.240> said<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> few<00:01:51.540> times<00:01:52.020> in

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
something that I've said a few times in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
something that I've said a few times in
my<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.500> videos<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.700> really

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
my other videos because this really

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
my other videos because this really
helps<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> need<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> win

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
helps you out a lot when you need to win

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590 
helps you out a lot when you need to win
a<00:01:55.619> gunfight<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.790> reason<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
a gunfight now the reason you want to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
a gunfight now the reason you want to
walk<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.409> you're<00:01:58.530> walking<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
walk is because if you're walking and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
walk is because if you're walking and
you<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.490> enemy<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> already<00:02:00.719> have

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you see an enemy then you already have

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
you see an enemy then you already have
your<00:02:01.290> gun<00:02:01.530> ready<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.979> shoot<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.909> you're

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
your gun ready to shoot but if you're

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
your gun ready to shoot but if you're
running<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.869> you'd<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> stop<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.710> pull

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
running then you'd have to stop and pull

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
running then you'd have to stop and pull
your<00:02:05.009> gun<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> could<00:02:06.030> shoot<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
your gun up so that you could shoot so

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.839 
your gun up so that you could shoot so
by<00:02:06.990> walking<00:02:07.590> you'll<00:02:08.039> save<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.789> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
by walking you'll save time in a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
by walking you'll save time in a
gunfight<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.780> lets<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.229> shoot<00:02:10.440> first

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
gunfight which lets you shoot first

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.920 
gunfight which lets you shoot first
which<00:02:11.280> makes<00:02:11.520> getting<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> kill<00:02:12.120> much<00:02:12.450> easier

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
which makes getting the kill much easier

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.520 
which makes getting the kill much easier
now

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
now

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.080 
now
something<00:02:13.800> else<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.459> helps<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.060> out

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
something else that also helps you out

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030 
something else that also helps you out
in<00:02:15.270> gunfights<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:16.020> drop-shotting

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
in gunfights is drop-shotting

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860 
in gunfights is drop-shotting
now<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.819> used<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> floor

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
now this is used to get you on the floor

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.420 
now this is used to get you on the floor
whilst<00:02:19.140> you're<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> gunfight<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.250> an

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
whilst you're in a gunfight with an

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430 
whilst you're in a gunfight with an
enemy<00:02:20.760> which<00:02:21.209> then<00:02:21.450> makes<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.810> much<00:02:22.080> harder

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
enemy which then makes you much harder

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.070 
enemy which then makes you much harder
to<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.650> killed<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> drop<00:02:24.360> shot<00:02:24.569> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to be killed now to do a drop shot you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.540 
to be killed now to do a drop shot you
need<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> go<00:02:25.410> prone<00:02:25.709> whilst<00:02:26.100> you're<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.459> a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
need to go prone whilst you're in a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.400 
need to go prone whilst you're in a
gunfight<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> make<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:27.990> easier

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
gunfight so the make that's easier

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.960 
gunfight so the make that's easier
switch<00:02:28.980> your<00:02:29.160> button<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.730> tactical

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
switch your button out to tactical

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.720 
switch your button out to tactical
instead<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.930> default<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.890> what<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.250> does<00:02:32.520> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
instead of default and what this does is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.040 
instead of default and what this does is
make<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.450> full<00:02:33.780> player

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
make it so that you have full player

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.920 
make it so that you have full player
control<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.680> your<00:02:34.739> analog<00:02:35.670> sticks<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.540> all<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
control in your analog sticks so all you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.420 
control in your analog sticks so all you
need<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.440> push<00:02:37.680> down<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.250> right

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
need to do is push down with your right

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.150 
need to do is push down with your right
thumb<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.760> go<00:02:39.330> prone<00:02:39.630> during<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.080> gunfight<00:02:40.319> now

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
thumb to go prone during a gunfight now

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.979 
thumb to go prone during a gunfight now
this<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.430> perfect<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:41.970> drop<00:02:42.270> shotting<00:02:42.510> but

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
this is perfect for drop shotting but

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.390 
this is perfect for drop shotting but
it's<00:02:43.110> also<00:02:43.319> really<00:02:43.680> good<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:43.950> getting<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
it's also really good for getting the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.759 
it's also really good for getting the
cover<00:02:44.610> really<00:02:44.850> fast<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.019> ever<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.500> me

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
cover really fast so if you ever see me

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.500 
cover really fast so if you ever see me
moving<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.370> down<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.550> my<00:02:47.790> videos<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> lot

it's because I'm always trying to make

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's because I'm always trying to make
myself<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.820> harder<00:02:51.150> target<00:02:51.300> for<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> enemies

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
myself a harder target for the enemies

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.680 
myself a harder target for the enemies
to<00:02:51.959> aim<00:02:52.200> at<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.650> also<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:53.519> killed<00:02:53.820> now<00:02:54.480> once

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to aim at and also be killed now once

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.600 
to aim at and also be killed now once
you<00:02:54.810> start<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.110> build<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.500> your<00:02:55.560> streak<00:02:56.070> it's<00:02:56.310> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
you start to build up your streak it's a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.949 
you start to build up your streak it's a
good<00:02:56.820> idea<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.120> start<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.570> play<00:02:57.720> more

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
good idea to start to play more

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.410 
good idea to start to play more
defensive<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.100> best<00:02:59.310> way<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.519> do<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.000> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
defensive so the best way to do that is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.880 
defensive so the best way to do that is
to<00:03:00.630> make<00:03:00.660> sure<00:03:01.019> you're<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> position<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.800> get

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
to make sure you're in a position to get

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.699 
to make sure you're in a position to get
a<00:03:01.950> kill<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.760> not<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:03.209> killed<00:03:03.569> now<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.200> do<00:03:04.410> this

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
a kill but not be killed now to do this

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.080 
a kill but not be killed now to do this
you<00:03:05.220> need<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.400> make<00:03:05.489> sure<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.880> whenever

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you need to make sure that whenever

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.580 
you need to make sure that whenever
there<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.600> chance<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.989> an<00:03:07.110> enemy<00:03:07.410> being

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
there is a chance of an enemy being

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.590 
there is a chance of an enemy being
nearby<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.640> you're<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.060> position<00:03:09.239> where

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
nearby that you're in a position where

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.729 
nearby that you're in a position where
you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.989> shoot<00:03:10.170> first

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
you can shoot first

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.770 
you can shoot first
now<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.310> isn't<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.760> hard<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.630> make

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
now this isn't that hard but to make

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.420 
now this isn't that hard but to make
this<00:03:12.900> work<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.410> well<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.220> need<00:03:14.370> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
this work really well you need to

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.710 
this work really well you need to
remember<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.819> range<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.360> gun<00:03:15.510> that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
remember the range of the gun that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.810 
remember the range of the gun that
you're<00:03:15.930> using<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:16.980> you're<00:03:17.100> using<00:03:17.310> an<00:03:17.489> SMG

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
you're using so if you're using an SMG

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.640 
you're using so if you're using an SMG
then<00:03:18.450> you'll<00:03:18.630> need<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> target<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.410> close

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
then you'll need a target to be close

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.319 
then you'll need a target to be close
and<00:03:19.920> if<00:03:20.190> you're<00:03:20.310> using<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.640> light<00:03:20.790> machine<00:03:21.120> gun

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
and if you're using a light machine gun

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.270 
and if you're using a light machine gun
then<00:03:21.720> you'll<00:03:21.870> need<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.049> be<00:03:22.200> further<00:03:22.410> away<00:03:22.799> and

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
then you'll need to be further away and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.440 
then you'll need to be further away and
this<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.519> because<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.030> want<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> take

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
this is because you want to take

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.630 
this is because you want to take
advantage<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.019> how<00:03:25.170> good<00:03:25.440> your<00:03:25.650> gun<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.130> so

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
advantage of how good your gun is so

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.800 
advantage of how good your gun is so
make<00:03:26.850> sure<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.060> you're<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> position<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
make sure that you're in a position to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.319 
make sure that you're in a position to
pick<00:03:28.079> off<00:03:28.260> easy<00:03:28.560> targets<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.519> not<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.970> killed

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
pick off easy targets but not be killed

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.420 
pick off easy targets but not be killed
so<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.110> way<00:03:31.320> you'll<00:03:31.739> be<00:03:31.799> able<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.040> continue

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
so this way you'll be able to continue

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.850 
so this way you'll be able to continue
to<00:03:32.459> build<00:03:32.700> your<00:03:32.850> streak<00:03:33.209> but<00:03:33.660> not<00:03:33.900> die<00:03:34.140> now<00:03:34.769> if

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
to build your streak but not die now if

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.229 
to build your streak but not die now if
you<00:03:34.950> combine<00:03:35.160> all<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:35.579> these<00:03:35.760> tips<00:03:36.060> together

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
you combine all of these tips together

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.000 
you combine all of these tips together
then<00:03:36.930> you'll<00:03:37.079> be<00:03:37.200> able<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.410> win<00:03:37.560> more<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:37.890> your

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
