the center but once again it's just a

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.430 
the center but once again it's just a
great<00:01:41.000> layering<00:01:41.270> actually<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.080> take<00:01:42.200> off<00:01:42.320> my

on<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.220> whistle<00:03:55.639> so<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:55.819> think<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.120> goes

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
on this whistle so I think it goes

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.229 
on this whistle so I think it goes
nicely<00:03:56.510> together<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:58.459> one's<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:58.849> from

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
lot of layers too and I think looks a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.390 
lot of layers too and I think looks a
lot<00:04:03.410> better<00:04:03.590> than<00:04:03.889> not<00:04:04.040> wearing<00:04:04.280> any

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
little a necklace that's kind of the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.479

delicate layering piece that i'm going
to<00:04:13.549> keep<00:04:13.669> on<00:04:13.819> all<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.209> time<00:04:14.359> even<00:04:14.569> looks<00:04:14.810> nice

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
to keep on all the time even looks nice

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.890 
to keep on all the time even looks nice
with<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:15.470> long<00:04:16.370> necklace<00:04:16.970> or<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.630> can<00:04:17.780> even

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
with this long necklace or you can even

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.719 
with this long necklace or you can even
add<00:04:18.200> another<00:04:18.560> necklace<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.519> just<00:04:19.669> a

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
add another necklace and this is just a

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.930 
add another necklace and this is just a
gold<00:04:20.000> chain<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.630> think<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.870> gold<00:04:21.139> chain<00:04:21.410> is

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
gold chain and I think a gold chain is

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.480 
gold chain and I think a gold chain is
definitely<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:22.970> must<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.979> like<00:04:25.190> ones<00:04:25.400> that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
definitely a must and I like ones that

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.620 
definitely a must and I like ones that
are<00:04:25.640> really<00:04:25.669> really<00:04:26.090> long<00:04:26.240> because<00:04:26.419> then<00:04:26.539> you

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
are really really long because then you

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.629 
are really really long because then you
can<00:04:26.750> layer<00:04:26.960> them<00:04:27.169> up<00:04:27.320> or<00:04:27.590> double<00:04:27.890> them<00:04:28.010> up

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
can layer them up or double them up

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.909 
can layer them up or double them up
so<00:04:29.120> this<00:04:29.240> one's<00:04:29.449> super<00:04:30.080> duper<00:04:30.530> long<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.740> don't

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
so this one's super duper long I don't

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.129 
so this one's super duper long I don't
even<00:04:31.009> know<00:04:31.159> where<00:04:31.310> it's<00:04:31.460> from<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:32.240> really<00:04:32.990> have

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
even know where it's from I really have

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.790 
even know where it's from I really have
