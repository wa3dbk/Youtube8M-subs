00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.400
 besides now on any on the map 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.940
 mines cyprus finale between komi mikhail 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.699
 Evseev samurai clone 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.689
 Penza in more matching samurai 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.810
 should be shorter and now they want to try 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.740
 to take 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.239
 so all the crowd is this 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.150
 bocharov 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.289
 everything does not drag 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.019
 the reason that flows is a mixture 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.289
 value 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.369
 2 6 3 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 watch the junction 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.730
 one car 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.620
 and basil does not remain 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.340
 all cars 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.830
 divided into two lines here dots lead to 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.050
 center 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.650
 this rush 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.560
 on the first 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.930
 third vertical 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.550
 and it will be rush 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 batik commander on the center 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.060
 d and color 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.200
 in the first minute of potassium weave in the press 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.900
 center 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.020
 so that there is no casting on the mountain all in 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.220
 principle of standard 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.680
 besides rails races 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.120
 conceived 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.950
 I climb on the lighthouse will disassemble bachata as 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.300
 the rest bachatu on water passes this 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.420
 an attempt to take what's in 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.750
 square target 4 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.860
 of course an hour 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.010
 they'll take away the pot just almost 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 they will take him away with either minus 1 minus 2 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.490
 will try now 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.570
 take the number of lots 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.130
 actually hand would 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.710
 from samurai balls 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 somewhere court 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.860
 but on the other hand that they do it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350
 here you now 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.350
 book capture became a couple of pages 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.140
 trying to survive 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.270
 they should have actually 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.710
 as soon as they saw this one is lost 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.550
 fall to the source 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.550
 all six acres that stood here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.890
 700 provided 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.850
 Espanyol field works they would not so much 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.340
 asked to buy 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.790
 and here are these Maccabi machines 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.310
 play suspenders 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.470
 and then Hamid would be much harder 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.399
 charly this 3 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.149
 Ie very well shot hundred 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.149
 the rest of the rush is not taken now 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.089
 the source gets on 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.619
 it turns out 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.759
 I canâ€™t rule out an expert 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.759
 part of the body pulls back on hammer 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.709
 even like very little 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.049
 i have very climbed may 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.389
 we wanted a tube 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.099
 pass meat crush principles clear 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.149
 skeleton 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 Hello 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.499
 would be here one of point two 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.229
 they could part seize it 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.499
 it would be easier for them 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.499
 and now every day could hardly 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.109
 Levitin 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.719
 parts of the experience of the screens are left capture by 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.719
 the road 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.769
 wants trying to charge playing by 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.319
 corpses 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.599
 everyone will take 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.920
 three flashes plus another girlfriend now 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.269
 will take seven 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.319
 wanna fall trying to escape 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.319
 another want of course will not be saved 9 8 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.799
 of course samurai 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.959
 shantsy principle now 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.549
 it's quite shaky 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.549
 and now it will turn out quickly pick up 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.849
 that principle samurai have a chance 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.849
 small of course but there is 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.939
 tactics are actually ways very 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.669
 interesting 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.439
 there are of course a couple of questions how would they 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.029
 really prime 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 there they took their city for example with covers 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:58.179
 as if not under surveillance 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.729
 what would they do if 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.449
 sent in a hurry to capture 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.029
 but on the other hand still 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.899
 12 10 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.859
 against strong enough advertising 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.739
 drum against 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.899
 the best way of hours 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.919
 remains 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.739
 five cars that stand in different places 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.590
 Needless to say no deals 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.590
 thanks 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 14 10 15 10 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:31.819
 quite interesting practice
