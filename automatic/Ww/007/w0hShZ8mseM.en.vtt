00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
recommend you not doing so because there

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530 
recommend you not doing so because there
is<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> bit<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.889> lag<00:00:14.099> when<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.940> try<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.120> do<00:00:15.330> so

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
but the main purpose of this is to try
