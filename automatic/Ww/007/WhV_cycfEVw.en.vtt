00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
attack in this case we're doing fire

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.410 
attack in this case we're doing fire
lightning<00:01:52.380> lightning<00:01:52.710> fire<00:01:53.340> which<00:01:53.970> results

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
lightning lightning fire which results

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.249

them<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> lot<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> sort<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
them up so a lot of the game is sort of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.330 
them up so a lot of the game is sort of
experimenting<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.710> trying<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> figure<00:02:02.130> out

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
experimenting and trying to figure out

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.550

what<00:02:02.520> each<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.909> spells<00:02:03.210> does<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> combine

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
what each of spells does as you combine

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.249 
what each of spells does as you combine
them<00:02:04.799> let's<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.340> ice<00:02:05.899> lightning<00:02:06.899> lightning

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
them let's do ice lightning lightning

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.850 
them let's do ice lightning lightning
Boosh<00:02:09.420> pretty<00:02:10.420> damn<00:02:11.050> cool

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860

what crazy shield lightning see this is

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.860 
what crazy shield lightning see this is
really<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.790> comes<00:02:16.000> down<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.540> you're

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
really all it comes down to is you're

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.690 
really all it comes down to is you're
just<00:02:17.019> like<00:02:17.230> I'm<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.890> tapping<00:02:18.099> stuff<00:02:18.580> at

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
just like I'm just tapping stuff at

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.610 
just like I'm just tapping stuff at
random<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.299> see<00:02:19.900> what<00:02:20.049> happens<00:02:20.379> and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
random and see what happens and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.470 
random and see what happens and
sometimes<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.340> set<00:02:21.519> myself<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.940> fire<00:02:22.000> but

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
sometimes I set myself on fire but

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.520 
sometimes I set myself on fire but
that's<00:02:22.599> part<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.989> fun

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
that's part of the fun

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.770 
that's part of the fun

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
but more importantly it's all about

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.050 
but more importantly it's all about
timing<00:03:00.099> you're<00:03:00.400> essentially<00:03:00.760> trying<00:03:01.000> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
timing you're essentially trying to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.089 
timing you're essentially trying to
explode<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.959> right<00:03:02.109> time<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:02.890> send

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
each of the levels has a time meter so

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.319 
each of the levels has a time meter so
you're<00:03:06.640> trying<00:03:06.819> to<00:03:06.879> get<00:03:06.970> through<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.239> level

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
as fast as possible it seems like they

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.710 
as fast as possible it seems like they
did<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> really<00:03:09.609> good<00:03:09.700> job<00:03:09.849> converting<00:03:10.599> the

of a bitch

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.610

but<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.419> pretty<00:03:16.660> simple<00:03:16.900> here<00:03:17.260> essentially

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
but it's pretty simple here essentially

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.229 
but it's pretty simple here essentially
you<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:17.829> gotta<00:03:18.549> worry<00:03:18.730> about<00:03:18.790> left<00:03:19.150> and

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
you just gotta worry about left and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.670 
you just gotta worry about left and
