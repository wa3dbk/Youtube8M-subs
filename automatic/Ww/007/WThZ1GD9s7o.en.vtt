00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.270
 rahim sterling refuses to sign 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.940
 new wage agreement in 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.369
 100,000 pounds a week 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.859
 what happens at all that this teenager 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.840
 allows itself to sell urgently 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.929
 but something like this this news 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.189
 met on the internet the fans on 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.470
 is rahim sterling really 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.689
 is sarva than it actually is in 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.400
 first we are talking about a footballer 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.680
 20 years and 180000 as requested and he rahim 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.750
 it seems like a lot but we are talking about 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.570
 football player who is under 20 years old 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.940
 matches at the highest level spent more 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.240
 than Messi and Cristiano that is how 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.210
 at least we are talking about an unusual young 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.820
 soccer player him stirling is mega talent 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.310
 second moment in the end of last season 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.190
 as at the beginning of this rahim sterling 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.530
 pulls a football club 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.900
 liverpool and last season when 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.910
 Starridge broke when Suar already thought 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.200
 about something else and not at liverpool circus 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.269
 the ending he smeared 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.399
 it's worth acknowledging somehow after all 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.609
 liverpool was in second place then 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.549
 there is 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:14.210
 who would not say rahim sterling 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.850
 made a real contribution to football success 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.829
 club liverpool and right now raheem 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.469
 Sterling is the most important player 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.170
 moment 3 many sterling does not seem 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.630
 super soccer player say he has a punch 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.079
 weak but maybe it's true that he 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.270
 instability something else and 180,000 on but 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.270
 does not fit the level 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.789
 sterling but friends on with numbers her 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.380
 argue under the age of 21 among the top 5 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.479
 European Sterling Championships 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.850
 just kill everyone with numbers and your 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.499
 statistics 7 assists no longer gave 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.740
 no one 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:54.439
 created moments too most of all and 89 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.329
 successful strokes of my rivals I think 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.719
 cristiano somewhere in this moment 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.549
 sad also rahim sterling 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.450
 can play absolutely on all positions 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.600
 mataki 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.459
 he can play left winger right 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.850
 insider the top ten central striker 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.670
 latera 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.040
 stupidly worthless truth and moment 4 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.740
 liverpool again saves and liverpool per 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.330
 it pays off funny how would that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.700
 save then cry 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.920
 but generally if you like liverpool 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.020
 barely fight for the champions league they 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 for a serious claim to gold 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.570
 pl let him save more and not because 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.820
 that liverpool doesn't want to pay 180,000 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.310
 there are none of his walls, because he did not want much 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.500
 pay and sanchez she has a mkhitaryan liana 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.070
 where are these players liverpool without league 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.980
 champions 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.200
 no trophies and no claims and just 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.660
 Sterling's salary claims 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.030
 seems like veiled questions guys 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.430
 echo and you seriously you will be for the trophy 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.650
 fight or how to invest in the composition 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.430
 buy normal top players or 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.610
 no here 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.880
 Chelsea Arsenal and Real Interest 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.610
 pushing forced liverpool to the dash 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.330
 either you guys are seriously investing in 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.780
 this club 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.090
 either not and already without rakhim sterling it 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.090
