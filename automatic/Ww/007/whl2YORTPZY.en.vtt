the okay so um black sludge obviously

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.680 
the okay so um black sludge obviously
for<00:00:38.820> uh<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.129> HP<00:00:41.129> recovery<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:42.059> could<00:00:42.450> go

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
for uh you know HP recovery you could go

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.680 
for uh you know HP recovery you could go
leftovers<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:45.000> know<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> switch<00:00:45.510> in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
leftovers but if you know you switch in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.959 
leftovers but if you know you switch in
on<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> trick<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.190> poison<00:00:47.460> somebody<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
on a trick you can poison somebody and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.410 
on a trick you can poison somebody and
that's<00:00:48.090> pretty<00:00:48.210> cool<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:50.090> that's<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that's pretty cool so that's what I have

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.279 
that's pretty cool so that's what I have
that<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> v's<00:00:54.230> 208<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> HP<00:00:55.949> that's<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
that there the v's 208 and HP that's a

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.389 
that there the v's 208 and HP that's a
leftovers<00:00:58.289> number<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.890> case<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.129> black

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
leftovers number or in this case a black

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.420 
leftovers number or in this case a black
sludge<00:00:59.699> number<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.719> you'll<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.140> gaining<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
sludge number so you'll be gaining the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.170 
sludge number so you'll be gaining the
maximum<00:01:02.879> amount<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.660> HP<00:01:03.870> back<00:01:05.090> obviously<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
maximum amount of HP back obviously you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.850 
maximum amount of HP back obviously you
want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> max<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> special<00:01:07.470> defense<00:01:07.850> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
want to max out the special defense and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
want to max out the special defense and
so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> need<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> extra<00:01:12.420> bulk<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
so you know you need that extra bulk and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
so you know you need that extra bulk and
a<00:01:13.619> careful<00:01:13.950> nature<00:01:14.280> will<00:01:14.520> also<00:01:14.820> help<00:01:15.030> boost

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a careful nature will also help boost

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.950 
a careful nature will also help boost
that<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.280> leftover<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.689> throw

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that and then the leftover I just throw

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.340 
that and then the leftover I just throw
an<00:01:19.049> attack<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.490> defense<00:01:20.880> before<00:01:21.350> now

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
an attack I had it in defense before now

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.310 
an attack I had it in defense before now
I<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.470> running<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.159> similar<00:01:23.490> spread<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
I was running like a similar spread to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.580 
I was running like a similar spread to
lux<00:01:25.320> EV<00:01:25.799> spread<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> um<00:01:27.960> actually

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
lux EV spread but this is um actually

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
lux EV spread but this is um actually
way<00:01:29.159> better<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.450> need<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
way better you don't really need the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.149 
way better you don't really need the
defense<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> wasn't<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.040> doing

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
defense because it wasn't really doing

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.109 
defense because it wasn't really doing
much<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.939> after<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> curse<00:01:33.659> anyways<00:01:35.119> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
much for you after the curse anyways the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.230 
much for you after the curse anyways the
curse<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.479> makes<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:38.240> found

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
curse really makes up for it and I found

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
curse really makes up for it and I found
that<00:01:39.570> I've<00:01:39.780> always<00:01:40.020> wanted<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.979> bit

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that I've always wanted that little bit

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
that I've always wanted that little bit
of<00:01:41.100> extra<00:01:41.280> attack<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
of extra attack and now I have it so the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.120 
of extra attack and now I have it so the
set<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:45.420> curse<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> star<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
set is this curse which is the star of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
set is this curse which is the star of
the<00:01:47.280> show<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.659> synthesis<00:01:49.290> for

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the show and then you have synthesis for

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.880 
the show and then you have synthesis for
recovery<00:01:50.610> power<00:01:51.570> width<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.960> your<00:01:52.110> awesome

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
recovery power width is your awesome

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
recovery power width is your awesome
powerful<00:01:53.280> stab<00:01:53.729> move<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
powerful stab move which is going to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.840 
powerful stab move which is going to
wreck<00:01:54.930> anything<00:01:55.829> after<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.399> curse<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
wreck anything after one curse and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.030 
wreck anything after one curse and
earthquake<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.060> coverage<00:02:01.009> you<00:02:02.009> want

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
earthquake for coverage you want

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.130 
earthquake for coverage you want
earthquake<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.299> those<00:02:03.540> steel<00:02:03.899> types

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
earthquake or those steel types

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.389
