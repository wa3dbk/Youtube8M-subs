00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:45.940
 good morning in Milan 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.860
 but what I'm saying I don't know French but 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.700
 luckily i'm trying a little 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.140
 motorbike because I have already had 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.720
 to climb one of the most in the saddle 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.970
 big news of 2014 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.820
 the brand new yamaha yz 250 f that changes 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.230
 completely what can change 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.530
 compared to last year 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.390
 throw away creti love the engine when 5 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.090
 valves the carburetor to the advantage of the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.610
 very famous now head- turned engine 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.550
 180 degrees with the new path a 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.190
 choice of engine exhaust manifold 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.430
 with a wet cover a great return 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.900
 also in this sector with the tank 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.840
 which therefore disappears much more engine 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 compact chassis adapted to 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.290
 features of the 250 with specifics 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.360
 specific handkerchiefs the tank comes 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.850
 moved a little further back to 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.650
 allow to gain volume at the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.940
 filter case that now even more 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.860
 easy to reach for 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.840
 special maintenance the ordinary of the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.610
 and come with me every day 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.410
 on the other side that let me see the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.299
 exhaust path that ends in 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.369
 this term 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.900
 very close to the center of gravity of the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.900
 motorcycle that he even requested to the 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.890
 design of a frame 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.049
 asymmetrical with the lower arm 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 very high to allow point 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.890
 the housing of this exhaust that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.740
 live impressed me to be 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 really very short and very tight 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.030
 certainly an area where the springs 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.190
 houses are working and this of yamaha 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.170
 it is certainly a very first step 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.000
 important while also allowed by the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.470
 fact that part of the development of the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.840
 collector sir develops point behind 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.340
 outside of the cylinder a motorcycle 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.840
 that we have just finished finding 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.519
 we are a little tired of the erio formula 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.769
 waiting for us to go home but we are 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.480
 with a smile because if we have passed 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.819
 a really fun day of love 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.230
 very nice to drive much easier 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.150
 above all much more competitive 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.970
 compared to the previous model has 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.160
 did the step but away he was called to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 do then expect to see it in 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.780
 track in the most important races but for 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.390
 now it is promoted with full marks and there 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.810
 we really enjoyed france I don't know 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.810
 already everything
