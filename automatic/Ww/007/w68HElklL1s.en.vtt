00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
size when the dough is double in size

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.249 
size when the dough is double in size
put<00:01:27.390> some<00:01:27.689> flour<00:01:27.990> onto<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.530> bench<00:01:28.740> top<00:01:29.119> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
put the dough onto the bench

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.090 
put the dough onto the bench
add<00:01:33.710> more<00:01:34.710> flour<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:36.770> divide<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.040> dough

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
add more flour and divide this dough

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.960 
add more flour and divide this dough
into<00:01:38.930> four<00:01:39.930> large<00:01:40.229> sized<00:01:40.619> balls<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.610> eight

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
into four large sized balls and eight

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.590 
into four large sized balls and eight
small<00:01:42.479> sized<00:01:42.810> bowls<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.860> has<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.520> equal<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
small sized bowls it has to be equal so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.289 
small sized bowls it has to be equal so
divide<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> dough<00:01:46.380> into<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:48.860> first<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
divide the dough into two first and

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.940 
divide the dough into two first and
divide<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.750> into<00:01:52.530> four<00:01:53.180> like<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.950> then

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
divide one into four like this and then

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.039 
divide one into four like this and then
divide<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.850> into<00:01:57.719> eight<00:01:57.990> equal<00:01:58.350> parts

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
divide the other into eight equal parts

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.249 
divide the other into eight equal parts
so<00:02:01.049> after<00:02:01.619> take<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.250> large<00:02:02.520> pieces<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.540> make

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so after take the large pieces and make

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.280 
so after take the large pieces and make
balls<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.979> from<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.329> press<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> down<00:02:06.810> like

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
balls out from that press it down like

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.580 
balls out from that press it down like
this<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:08.209> then<00:02:09.209> use<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.720> farm

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this and then use a farm

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.490 
this and then use a farm
and<00:02:10.770> make<00:02:11.069> balls<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.720> leave<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.290> on

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and make balls like this and leave it on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.240 
and make balls like this and leave it on
the<00:02:13.560> baking<00:02:14.100> sheet<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.080> after<00:02:16.080> take<00:02:16.890> one
