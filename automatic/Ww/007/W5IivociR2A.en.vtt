00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello here is a connection with recently 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.130
 what happened Chelyabinsk explosion 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.130
 meteorite 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.980
 here meteorite began to attract increased 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.160
 public attention is by the way very 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.049
 interesting fact a blast what is it he suddenly 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.039
 exploded and what is a meteorite flies 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.990
 some stone well a piece of metal if 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.279
 this is an iron meteorite iron nickel 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 Well, a piece of ice if it is a piece of comet 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 a huge snowball flies he enters he 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.940
 the atmosphere is heated train 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.110
 explodes why here's the question why am i 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.410
 Now I will try to answer this question. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.879
 answer tell what I learned in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.360
 Because of this , I learned from 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 completely unimaginable things often 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 it means this is what the body poured into 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 earth's atmosphere what body is like 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.340
 Chelyabinsk meteorite flies with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.370
 speed exceeding the speed of sound well 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.800
 so let's say 100 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.340
 there in the region of 30 kilometers per second to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.519
 and the sound is 0.3 somewhere 0 34 kilometers in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.420
 second it means it's a hundred times faster 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.310
 what is the sound called this 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.439
 hypersonic speed 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.270
 he flies and immediately creates a shock wave 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.390
 even in sparse upper layers 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 the atmosphere of what it is but understandable 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 the thing is that the shock wave glows she 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.500
 hot heated will be compressed air and in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.299
 shock wave it glows like a shock 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 wave of a nuclear explosion for the first time 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.299
 glows to very tightly that is from almost 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 how nuclear weapons are consumed energy 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.920
 bye why why explode 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.390
 explode explain to them now explain 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 meteorite explodes about the same 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.259
 why can say let's steam 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.100
 boiler first about the steam boiler in 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.850
 steam boiler 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.860
 under great pressure is water 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.939
 the pressure is so big that he is me but she 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.829
 it does not boil much hotter type than 100 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.770
 degrees Celsius boiling point 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.010
 water is much hot several times 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.620
 means 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.750
 Well, hundreds of degrees Celsius is not good 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.869
 said several times like this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.130
 hundreds a few hundred and that's when suddenly 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.990
 this cauldron collapses suddenly something with 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.840
 it relieves pressure 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.890
 in this liquid it boils 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.580
 Now imagine this 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.340
 the meteorite flies it creates a shock wave 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.070
 carbon wave so strong that she 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.930
 shining what does it mean what means 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.510
 a meteorite that's a shock 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.870
 the wave is moving the body here it is heavenly she 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:46.810
 lie strongly and it is very tightly compressed and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.620
 not only on the liquid 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.570
 but also on solid in spreads 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.510
 these are the principles we talked about 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.330
 when talked about boiling water potter 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.920
 very tight body if you are sharp 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.020
 unload what will happen to him 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:08.020
 its destruction will occur like an explosion 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.239
 would say boiling yes yes here's actually 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.110
 this is the pressure released here will lead to 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.270
 its destruction dumping destruction and here 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.100
 the most interesting and connected with it 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.080
 firstly these are the TNT equivalent and 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.989
 can be there very good there 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.930
 megatons dozens my ready yes here 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.840
 such here in our atomic 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.489
 carry things so here it is interesting 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.600
 that's all wanted when I wanted you 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:38.489
 it turns out there is still such 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 a very rare phenomenon of course 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.390
 occurs on earth may be times 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.310
 several hundred million years 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.650
 falls right on the ground actually 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.820
 responsibly cometary nucleus shock wave 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.750
 comet nuclei is still saying 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.150
 frozen ice 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.800
 Well, it's clear that she has heated up 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.690
 it is compressed fluid and here it is enough 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.209
 severely slowed down so that both teeth 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.790
 here it is removed this load with not she 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.280
 boil explosion from this explosion is monstrous 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.900
 power shock wave black hits 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.650
 surface of the earth and then what 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.600
 and then you know 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.640
 strike the tank armor on the other side 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.010
 will break away and here our going on inside 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.420
 formation of a huge cavity in the chest 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.260
 no correspondent tens of kilometers 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.530
 a huge cave, but such a model 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.670
 impact on land of this kind here 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.670
 comets good luck in all good
