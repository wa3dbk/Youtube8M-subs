00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 Good day! 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 My name is Yury Spasokukotsky And now I will show you one of the ways to develop the broadest muscles of the back, on mass and width. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 To do this, perform a set of partial amplitude drop set, first tightening with 40 kilograms 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And immediately without rest pulling up with their own weight, which I have about 100 kg. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Those. We start with a total weight of about 140 kg. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 We do until, at least a little, you can shift your weight. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Despite the fact that at the end of the approach you have no strength to pull up to the end. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 All the same, you continue to do in partial amplitude, extremely kill your back muscles. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Thank!
