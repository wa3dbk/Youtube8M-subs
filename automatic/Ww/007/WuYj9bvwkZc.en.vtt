right here and then this little bracelet
so<00:02:05.280> yeah<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.820> completely<00:02:06.299> different

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
so yeah it's a completely different

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
sculpt on the legs too and on the back
here<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.120> meant<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.480> have

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
here you can see it is not meant to have

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.430 
here you can see it is not meant to have
a<00:02:12.840> key

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440

I<00:02:13.470> don't<00:02:14.160> know<00:02:14.280> me<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.820> could<00:02:15.000> maybe<00:02:15.270> had<00:02:15.570> some

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
I don't know me it could maybe had some

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.230 
I don't know me it could maybe had some
more<00:02:16.050> pain<00:02:16.230> apps<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> back<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.970> not

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
more pain apps on the back but not

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210 
more pain apps on the back but not
nearly<00:02:18.510> status<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.200> band<00:02:19.440> ideas<00:02:19.710> what<00:02:20.010> their

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
nearly status a band ideas what their

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.430 
nearly status a band ideas what their
lords<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.150> figures<00:02:21.600> why<00:02:21.780> not<00:02:21.960> painting<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
lords that figures why not painting the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.030 
lords that figures why not painting the
rest<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.460> back<00:02:23.610> looks<00:02:23.880> pretty<00:02:24.120> good

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
rest but so the back looks pretty good

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.100 
rest but so the back looks pretty good
and<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.250> has<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.610> nice<00:02:26.850> paint<00:02:27.300> apps<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.930> on

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and it has the nice paint apps to you on

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.840 
and it has the nice paint apps to you on
it<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.680> head<00:02:28.830> sculpt<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.580> pretty

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
it the head sculpt I think is pretty

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.580 
it the head sculpt I think is pretty
much<00:02:30.060> identical<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.960> other<00:02:31.140> authority

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
much identical to the other authority

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.500 
much identical to the other authority
but<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.700> quite<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> nice

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
but so it's quite a bit a nice

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.220 
but so it's quite a bit a nice

line<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.519> up<00:03:26.640> there's<00:03:27.390> two<00:03:27.660> points<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:28.140> knee

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
line it up there's two points of knee

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.860 
line it up there's two points of knee
articulation<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.730> feet<00:03:30.000> do<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.570> fully

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
articulation and the feet do you fully

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.390 
articulation and the feet do you fully
rotate<00:03:31.320> as<00:03:31.440> well<00:03:31.620> as<00:03:31.680> put<00:03:31.890> four<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> back

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
rotate as well as put four in the back

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.610 
rotate as well as put four in the back
so<00:03:32.670> really<00:03:33.209> good<00:03:33.360> articulation<00:03:33.630> for<00:03:34.320> this

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
so really good articulation for this
