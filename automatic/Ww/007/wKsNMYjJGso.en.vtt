00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
like on something like the vintage and
like<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.620> most<00:00:52.800> bikes<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.360> will

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
like on most bikes really so it will

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
like on most bikes really so it will
that<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:54.870> lead<00:00:55.079> I'll<00:00:55.440> build<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.949> later

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
that will lead I'll build on that later

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
that will lead I'll build on that later
on<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> open<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> main<00:00:57.000> section<00:00:57.480> however

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
on when I open the main section however

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
on when I open the main section however
one<00:00:58.350> feature<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.680> particularly<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.430> when

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
one feature I particularly like is when

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
one feature I particularly like is when
we<00:00:59.789> come<00:00:59.969> around<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.390> side<00:01:00.449> we've<00:01:01.410> got

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
we come around to this side we've got

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.250 
we come around to this side we've got
ourselves<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.309> water<00:01:02.879> bottle<00:01:03.359> holder<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
ourselves a water bottle holder that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.280 
ourselves a water bottle holder that
detaches<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.060> detach<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
detaches you can just detach like that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.190 
detaches you can just detach like that
so<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.549> need<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
so if you do need to be one because of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.570 
so if you do need to be one because of
the<00:01:10.260> fact<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> quite<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.220> rest<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the fact that this is quite a rest of
