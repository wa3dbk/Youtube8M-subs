00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.980
 Hello everyone is Chiaki Miyakawa also opened the e-mail magazine for the first time in six months yesterday 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:14.540
 Thank you very much for getting to this video regardless of 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:20.280
 I think that many people now see me on facebook 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:23.930
 Recently, Toka and go to Sanzenin be an average Toka or orchestrated the I 7000 good five pages 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.370
 Nakatani says strongly and you think for yourself 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:35.030
 After heading a result of the Soviet Union in Toka never of facebook technique 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:40.640
 I was not lacking in know-how or something, but after all I would like my own values â€‹â€‹and fibrillation 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.920
 In the medium of facebook that is the best to know 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.480
 Recently I re-recognized that I just did some work 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.170
 Six months in what is it that's why everyone fold to a free type test named 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.340
 Where is the direction of my value 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.989
 Test that you can easily understand using the study of Wells Dals 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.320
 I received it 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.560
 Did you remember 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:13.870
 Everyone, of course , those who dye and those who do animals will always try something hard every day 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.860
 Work hard if we who have come are struggling I feel it 's but not rewarded in one 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:22.310
 It is only necessary that only high school students go to the correct high school 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:27.680
 Even if it tries hard the same chocolate will work well if there is no mistake in the direction 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.880
 Even if I really want to tell you, let 's analyze the professional town along the free type test by the time of the day at home 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.340
 In my arm Kyoko 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.869
 I prepared a square 8 I remember that there was a type that analyzed 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.700
 Would you please 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:45.219
 Creator type star supporter 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 Absolutely everyone to Neil Maker Trader Accutor Road Mechanic 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:53.890
 Because I thought that there are many people who belong but I have forgotten 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:58.720
 It is said that yesterday's e-mail magazine can seem to be another free type 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.720
 url I put a link , but some of you who have not started your game 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.060
 Once again 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.320
 Please look for including an unknown board 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.600
 In another 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:15.940
 Use this Deus dials square before you do a profile pressure gravestone 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:21.730
 I think today that only the outline of all profiles was understood 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.750
 I 'm calling western square but this square how to raise it 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.530
 First of all 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:33.370
 Up and down which is which do and will continue to divide the Fu that the right-to-left or which is which wealth of teacher 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.930
 Or the Ne by this cut in Yappa person in the conversation between 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.550
 Such also Kayo say kneaded by people above ish a Yappa 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:47.380
 The top , bottom, left and right of the ice will be important 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:50.470
 Well then people who belong to more than half when it is divided into nine according to the judgment criteria that first sold 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.710
 You divided into those who belong want to than half 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.980
 Hanyu even though dream I was beyond the mechanical 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.640
 I think the load and the supporters have a sandy halves 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.720
 Please give me 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.640
 Those who are under- handed are fall metatrader du makers though 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:13.270
 Please hope to have a sandy half tongue same load supporters 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:17.800
 Well then there are many types of criteria that determine what this joy means 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:23.730
 It is good to divide it into something like that, but it only makes sense 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.730
 So communicate us to the upper half of the criteria for determining a lifetime 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.600
 Intuition 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.810
 It is people who rely on instinct to decide one's life 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.450
 When mixed ideas come down 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.560
 It was in Kubo , but it's a smashed, really novel partner is always round with a head and from scratch 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.790
 Anyway 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:53.620
 The very sweet type that produces goods and services is this type 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:56.760
 Then the type in the lower half, on the other hand, exchanges where to put the decision- making machine 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.760
 It is not put in 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:07.510
 What is the meaning of compatibility ? 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.990
 Although it's such that on the basis that you have experience with it Toka myself felt in the skin determine the things 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.800
 Also 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.630
 For example 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:19.100
 I do n't know if I can make it on the job level, but it looks like it's going to work 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:24.560
 Karaii the Tteyuu 5 times great man is though that you have is that should contain what doenjang 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.650
 It feels like a think and I think Toka Korekayu financed these things because this happens will catch 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.820
 It is also a measure in terms of analysis and type 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.290
 Together key procedure is different 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.980
 Well then the next will split the left and right 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.190
 The right type is Boraster Supporter Deal Maker 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:47.200
 If you are a curie, you can take half the radar action and 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:50.770
 It is a mechanic road Accure that I hit left to our house but the same 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:57.100
 Think half of the craters and traders have that qualities 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:00.200
 Then we divide the behavior characteristics if we divide by the right or store 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.900
 a Right half is 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.900
 It is said to be a diplomatic type 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.779
 Say the left half in the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.260
 Not a type of law 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.249
 Called 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.329
 In terms of tragedy it's doing no diplomatic 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:25.289
 Not 's things like that but the lower barrel is bad flight's in that there is no softening 

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:28.679
 It is about where we have the national standard value 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:35.039
 In the case of an outgoing person, the standard is 1 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:37.270
 Toka things the basis of the value of Tteyuu not You're even introverted does not have a left and right talent to 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.680
 When the result and the number are taken 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:45.520
 Oya 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:49.900
 There is a standard, for example, in the day cs business people in the right half are themselves 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:55.180
 I think about how to create a system that does not rotate if there is not 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:57.580
 People in the left half have to make a system that they don't have to do five times 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.700
 That's the type of building 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.570
 On this 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:06.230
 I think I understand that I want to get a good exposure to the racer 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:11.689
 For example, if you are a star type 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:20.329
 That if I do what kind of decision when you are changing decided the business damage and outlook 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:21.649
 At first it is soft upper half or a little pan power Believe your instinct and come with your pin and yet something 

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:23.969
 When you thoroughly good child 

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:30.719
 People 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:33.449
 There are many types of transfers that are relatively successful when relying on such things to decide things 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:39.299
 People are from here from this square 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:43.249
 So the place was this thought also would like to describe the effect of the one-by-one after tomorrow 

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:43.249
 I think I can see it again
