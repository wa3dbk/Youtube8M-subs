00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
looking at Assassin's Creed a bit from

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.349 
looking at Assassin's Creed a bit from
the<00:00:39.859> outside<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.429> thinking<00:00:40.789> maybe<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.300> should

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
the outside and thinking maybe I should

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.910 
the outside and thinking maybe I should
jump<00:00:41.629> in<00:00:41.780> but<00:00:41.929> maybe<00:00:42.170> it's<00:00:42.379> I've<00:00:42.530> missed<00:00:42.800> too

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
jump in but maybe it's I've missed too

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.439 
jump in but maybe it's I've missed too
much<00:00:43.039> everything<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.789> happened<00:00:44.059> before<00:00:44.180> in

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
much everything that happened before in

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.599 
much everything that happened before in
the<00:00:44.479> brand<00:00:44.750> happened<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:45.859> we're<00:00:46.339> assuming

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
the brand happened and we're assuming

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.029 
the brand happened and we're assuming
that<00:00:46.909> right<00:00:47.120> but<00:00:47.750> it's<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.140> new<00:00:48.350> start<00:00:48.679> it's<00:00:48.949> a

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
that right but it's a new start it's a

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.859 
that right but it's a new start it's a
new<00:00:49.159> narrative<00:00:49.339> start<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.329> is

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:50.869 
new narrative start and that is

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:52.930 
new narrative start and that is
symbolized<00:00:51.350> by<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.649> completely<00:00:52.219> new<00:00:52.399> context

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
symbolized by a completely new context

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.789 
symbolized by a completely new context
for<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.180> present<00:00:53.510> day<00:00:53.600> now<00:00:54.140> you've<00:00:54.530> seen<00:00:54.739> a

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
for the present day now you've seen a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.079 
for the present day now you've seen a
little<00:00:55.100> bit<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.250> an<00:00:55.339> evolution<00:00:55.760> with<00:00:55.879> Black

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
little bit of an evolution with Black

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.219 
little bit of an evolution with Black
Flag<00:00:56.329> we're<00:00:56.570> not<00:00:56.690> going<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:56.869> do<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.049> same

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
Flag we're not going to do the same

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.660 
Flag we're not going to do the same
thing<00:00:57.439> this<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:57.859> what<00:00:58.100> we're<00:00:58.250> doing<00:00:58.280> with

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
thing this is what we're doing with

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.619 
thing this is what we're doing with
unity<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.149> really<00:00:59.659> the<00:00:59.930> beginning<00:01:01.449> for<00:01:02.449> this

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
unity is really the beginning for this

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.630 
unity is really the beginning for this
new<00:01:03.079> cycle<00:01:03.680> of<00:01:03.769> Assassin's<00:01:04.220> Creed<00:01:04.430> games

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
new cycle of Assassin's Creed games

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.630 
new cycle of Assassin's Creed games
because<00:01:05.059> it's<00:01:05.210> new<00:01:05.449> we<00:01:06.140> can<00:01:06.289> actually<00:01:06.679> explain

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
because it's new we can actually explain

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.160 
because it's new we can actually explain
it<00:01:07.789> properly<00:01:07.909> because<00:01:08.360> nobody<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:08.990> going<00:01:09.110> to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
it properly because nobody is going to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.859 
it properly because nobody is going to
feel<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:09.679> redundant<00:01:10.009> right<00:01:10.569> so<00:01:11.569> i

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
feel like it's redundant right so i

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.690 
feel like it's redundant right so i
would<00:01:12.110> say<00:01:12.289> that<00:01:12.319> Assassin's<00:01:12.979> Creed<00:01:13.190> unity<00:01:13.220> is

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
would say that Assassin's Creed unity is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.660 
would say that Assassin's Creed unity is
probably<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.780> best<00:01:14.990> entry<00:01:15.799> point<00:01:16.069> for<00:01:16.549> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
probably the best entry point for the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.850 
probably the best entry point for the
franchise<00:01:16.819> since<00:01:17.450> AC<00:01:17.750> 1<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:18.470> now<00:01:18.500> we're<00:01:18.710> may

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
franchise since AC 1 so now we're may

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.639 
franchise since AC 1 so now we're may
first<00:01:19.130> 2014<00:01:19.819> I<00:01:20.000> guess<00:01:20.149> that<00:01:20.330> puts<00:01:20.509> us<00:01:20.690> five

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
first 2014 I guess that puts us five

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.570 
first 2014 I guess that puts us five
weeks<00:01:21.920> give<00:01:22.159> or<00:01:22.220> take<00:01:22.459> from<00:01:23.299> e3<00:01:23.569> yep<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.580> what's
