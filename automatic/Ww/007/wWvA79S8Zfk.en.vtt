00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
ages 8 and up and there is the bumblebee

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
ages 8 and up and there is the bumblebee
Camaro<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.989> sound<00:00:40.320> system<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
Camaro and there is a sound system so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
Camaro and there is a sound system so
bumblebee<00:00:41.670> doesn't<00:00:42.000> talk<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.660> talks<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bumblebee doesn't talk he just talks to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.190 
bumblebee doesn't talk he just talks to
his<00:00:43.350> sounds<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> radio<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.079> see

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
his sounds on the radio so you can see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
his sounds on the radio so you can see
it's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> two-in-one<00:00:46.640> transforming<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's a two-in-one transforming and it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.360 
it's a two-in-one transforming and it's
really<00:00:48.930> cool<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.559> press<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> button

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.610 

so<00:00:52.910> doesn't<00:00:53.150> really<00:00:53.330> need<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.110> be<00:00:54.290> eight

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
so doesn't really need to be eight

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.570 
so doesn't really need to be eight
enough<00:00:54.890> but<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:55.160> think<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:58.100> he's<00:00:58.370> got<00:00:58.550> a

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
enough but I think and he's got a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.280 
enough but I think and he's got a
removable<00:00:59.030> weapon<00:00:59.540> so

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
removable weapon so

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.030 
removable weapon so
we'll<00:01:01.680> hear<00:01:01.860> him<00:01:02.070> talk<00:01:02.370> later<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> program

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
we'll hear him talk later in the program

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
we'll hear him talk later in the program
so<00:01:05.040> he's<00:01:05.159> pretty<00:01:05.339> easily<00:01:05.640> control<00:01:06.180> there's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so he's pretty easily control there's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
so he's pretty easily control there's
just<00:01:06.600> two<00:01:06.780> buttons<00:01:07.020> left<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:08.070> forward<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
just two buttons left right forward and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.260 
just two buttons left right forward and
back

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
back

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
back
and<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.260> use<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> mix<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.100> joysticks<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and you use a mix of joysticks to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
and you use a mix of joysticks to
achieve<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.420> he<00:01:13.110> goes<00:01:13.290> six<00:01:13.619> kilometers<00:01:14.220> an

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
achieve that he goes six kilometers an

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.480 
achieve that he goes six kilometers an
hour<00:01:14.960> which<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.590> scale<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
hour which if you scale it up it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:50.830 
hour which if you scale it up it's
ninety<00:01:17.940> four<00:01:20.720> let's<00:01:21.720> take<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> look

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.480 

it<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> quite<00:01:52.229> fiddly<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.799> different<00:01:53.219> any

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it is quite fiddly so different any

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.929 
it is quite fiddly so different any
modern<00:01:53.789> toy<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.390> days

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.099 

Spanish<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> type<00:01:59.179> once<00:02:00.179> his<00:02:00.359> buddy<00:02:00.600> he<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
Spanish and type once his buddy he is

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:07.800 
Spanish and type once his buddy he is
awesome

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.809 

and<00:02:08.810> we're<00:02:09.080> still<00:02:09.320> going

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.009 

all<00:02:14.329> right<00:02:14.829> weapon

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:03:35.800 

field

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.300 

all<00:03:36.810> right<00:03:37.020> we<00:03:37.170> finally<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.680> bumblebee<00:03:38.130> out

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
all right we finally not bumblebee out

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.270 
all right we finally not bumblebee out
of<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.580> packet<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:40.470> seemed<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.800> take<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:41.010> lot

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
of the packet it seemed to take a lot

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.090 
of the packet it seemed to take a lot
for<00:03:41.460> a<00:03:41.550> simple<00:03:41.880> remote-control<00:03:42.510> car<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.890> you

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
for a simple remote-control car and you

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.560 
for a simple remote-control car and you
put<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.310> 9-volt<00:03:44.760> battery<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.630> remote

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
put a 9-volt battery in the remote

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.470 
put a 9-volt battery in the remote
control<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.700> from<00:03:50.700> memory<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.390> was

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
control and from memory I think it was

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.170 
control and from memory I think it was
three<00:03:51.840> double<00:03:52.410> A<00:03:52.470> batteries<00:03:52.670> in<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.850> vehicle

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
three double A batteries in the vehicle

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.830 
three double A batteries in the vehicle
itself

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.240 

so<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.959> need<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.140> Phillips<00:04:01.500> head<00:04:01.680> screwdriver

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
so you need a Phillips head screwdriver

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.980 
so you need a Phillips head screwdriver
to<00:04:02.640> open<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.329> battery<00:04:03.480> compartment

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.650

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
combination error rear-wheel drive was

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.090 
combination error rear-wheel drive was
transforming<00:04:32.590> they<00:04:33.590> actually<00:04:33.860> did<00:04:33.980> pretty

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
transforming they actually did pretty

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:48.850
