probably<00:00:37.359> one<00:00:37.629> that<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.929> mean<00:00:38.140> as<00:00:38.980> far<00:00:39.280> as<00:00:39.399> I<00:00:39.489> can

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
probably one that I mean as far as I can

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.799 
probably one that I mean as far as I can
remember<00:00:39.670> one<00:00:39.999> of<00:00:40.089> the<00:00:40.149> worst<00:00:40.329> qualifying

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
remember one of the worst qualifying

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
sessions we'd had we generally good in

sessions we'd had we generally good in
the<00:00:43.179> wet<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.629> I<00:00:44.489> felt<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.819> tires<00:00:46.089> were

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
the wet and I felt that the tires were

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.759 
the wet and I felt that the tires were
switched<00:00:46.569> on<00:00:46.780> but<00:00:46.960> they<00:00:47.050> weren't<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.440> didn't

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
switched on but they weren't I didn't

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:48.630 
switched on but they weren't I didn't
have<00:00:47.859> a<00:00:47.890> lot<00:00:48.039> of<00:00:48.100> grip<00:00:48.309> when<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.550> was

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
have a lot of grip when I was

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.790 
have a lot of grip when I was
aquaplaning<00:00:49.089> a<00:00:49.300> lot<00:00:49.449> it<00:00:49.629> was<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:50.140> visibility

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
aquaplaning a lot it was the visibility

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.279 
aquaplaning a lot it was the visibility
was<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:53.769> can't<00:00:54.039> really<00:00:54.219> see<00:00:54.659> 10<00:00:55.659> meters<00:00:56.050> and

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
was you can't really see 10 meters and

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.319 
was you can't really see 10 meters and
20<00:00:56.889> meters<00:00:57.129> in<00:00:57.219> front<00:00:57.309> of<00:00:57.460> he<00:00:57.579> was<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.999> was<00:00:58.120> very

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
20 meters in front of he was it was very

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.520 
20 meters in front of he was it was very
very<00:00:58.479> difficult<00:00:58.569> especially<00:00:59.049> when<00:00:59.379> there's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
very difficult especially when there's

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.369 
very difficult especially when there's
other<00:00:59.649> cars<00:00:59.889> in<00:00:59.979> front<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.569> rain<00:01:01.749> was<00:01:02.079> it

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
was heavy and some parts of the circuit

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.000 
was heavy and some parts of the circuit
than<00:01:04.120> others<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.570> there's<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.110> lot<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.290> streams

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
than others and there's a lot of streams

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.560 
than others and there's a lot of streams
coming<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.550> lot<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.790> rivers<00:01:07.060> coming<00:01:07.270> across<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
coming a lot of rivers coming across the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.900 
coming a lot of rivers coming across the
track<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.050> you<00:01:08.770> kind<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.100> always<00:01:09.280> feather<00:01:09.700> in

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
track so you kind of always feather in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
can we get back to the front how can we

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.010 
can we get back to the front how can we
get<00:01:39.340> some<00:01:39.460> points<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.000> how<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.690> we<00:01:40.810> were<00:01:40.960> in

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
get some points and how can we were in

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.250

the<00:01:41.110> race<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:41.590> for<00:01:41.950> myself<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.460> still<00:01:42.820> believe

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
the race and for myself I still believe

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.390 
the race and for myself I still believe
there<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.650> possibility<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.310> could

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
there is that possibility you could

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.820 
there is that possibility you could
still<00:01:45.640> win<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.850> race<00:01:46.030> from<00:01:46.210> back<00:01:46.360> there

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
still win the race from back there

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.070 
still win the race from back there
something<00:01:47.830> magical<00:01:48.370> happens<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.930> did

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
something magical happens and and it did

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.050 
something magical happens and and it did
you<00:01:50.200> know<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.470> was<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.650> magical<00:01:50.980> race<00:01:51.130> for<00:01:51.280> me

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.920 

well<00:01:55.060> first<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.330> all<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.450> don't<00:01:55.570> feel<00:01:55.780> I'm

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
well first of all I don't feel I'm

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.730 
well first of all I don't feel I'm
passing<00:01:56.350> over<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> crown<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:57.190> feel<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:58.470> still<00:01:59.470> have

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
passing over a crown I feel I still have

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.710 
passing over a crown I feel I still have
number<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.160> my<00:02:00.250> car<00:02:00.490> until<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.330> last<00:02:01.510> race

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
number one of my car until the last race

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.150 
number one of my car until the last race
so<00:02:01.900> i<00:02:01.930> don't<00:02:02.140> have<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.290> pass<00:02:02.560> over<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:03.100> yet

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
so i don't have to pass over just yet

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.490 
so i don't have to pass over just yet
but<00:02:03.520> um<00:02:03.790> now<00:02:04.510> i'm<00:02:04.630> very<00:02:04.660> happy<00:02:04.990> for<00:02:05.170> him<00:02:05.320> you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
but um now i'm very happy for him you

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.080 
but um now i'm very happy for him you
know<00:02:05.530> if<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:06.340> great<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.700> he<00:02:06.790> could<00:02:06.910> do<00:02:07.000> it

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
know if it's great that he could do it

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.090 
know if it's great that he could do it
for<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> country<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.870> I<00:02:08.200> know<00:02:08.800> he's<00:02:08.950> had<00:02:09.070> a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
for the country and I know he's had a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.060 
for the country and I know he's had a
huge<00:02:09.460> warm<00:02:10.060> welcome<00:02:10.360> back<00:02:10.510> here<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.930> I<00:02:11.110> think

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
huge warm welcome back here and I think

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.640 
huge warm welcome back here and I think
he's<00:02:12.280> probably<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:13.300> overwhelmed<00:02:14.080> trying<00:02:14.470> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
he's probably just overwhelmed trying to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.190 
he's probably just overwhelmed trying to
sit<00:02:14.860> back<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.090> absorb<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.870> too<00:02:17.050> much

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
sit back and absorb it but it's too much

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.910 
sit back and absorb it but it's too much
to<00:02:17.380> absorb<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:19.050> I'm<00:02:20.050> sure<00:02:20.110> he's<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.530> bubbly

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to absorb so I'm sure he's just bubbly

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.460 
to absorb so I'm sure he's just bubbly
bubbly<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.480> enjoying<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.050> he's<00:02:23.230> number

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
bubbly is and enjoying it he's number

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.810 
bubbly is and enjoying it he's number
one<00:02:24.570> he's<00:02:25.570> got<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.020> year<00:02:26.820> then

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
one he's got it for a year then

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.170 
one he's got it for a year then
hopefully<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> try<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.840> take<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.140> back
