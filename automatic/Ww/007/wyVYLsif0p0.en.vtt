it out yesterday the same spot it it did

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.710 
it out yesterday the same spot it it did
pretty<00:00:29.279> good<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.820> wasn't<00:00:30.210> too<00:00:30.300> bad<00:00:30.510> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
pretty good it was wasn't too bad it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
pretty good it was wasn't too bad it
took<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> little<00:00:31.050> longer<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.859> set<00:00:32.099> up

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
took a little longer to get it set up

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.180 
took a little longer to get it set up
than<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.480> originally<00:00:33.690> thinking<00:00:34.190> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
than what I was originally thinking it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.400 
than what I was originally thinking it
probably<00:00:35.280> took<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.120> close<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> 20<00:00:36.899> minutes<00:00:37.230> up

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
probably took me close to 20 minutes up

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
probably took me close to 20 minutes up
see<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.370> time<00:00:38.640> down<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.120> little

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
see if I can get that time down a little

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
see if I can get that time down a little
bit<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:39.809> since<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.040> second

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
bit this time since it's my second

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.770 
bit this time since it's my second
go-around<00:00:42.739> it's<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.399> about<00:00:44.700> crack<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.629> dawn

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
go-around it's just about crack of dawn

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.330 
go-around it's just about crack of dawn
right<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.360> I'll<00:00:49.170> launch<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.860> here

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
right now but I'll launch it out here

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.680 
right now but I'll launch it out here
and<00:00:51.140> we'll<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.469> how<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.739> goes<00:00:56.360> well<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> boats

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and we'll see how it goes well the boats

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860 
and we'll see how it goes well the boats
out<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> water<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.620> doing<00:00:58.920> well<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
out on the water it's doing well the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.889 
out on the water it's doing well the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
seat that I made sits too low for me

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.320 
seat that I made sits too low for me
it's<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.589> real<00:01:04.860> comfortable<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.150> I'm

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

just sitting on the bucket like that and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
just sitting on the bucket like that and
that's<00:01:09.000> actually<00:01:09.780> something<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.500> came<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.890> with

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's actually something I came up with

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
real quick just for a battery box but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.690 
real quick just for a battery box but
all-in-all<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:15.840> quite<00:01:16.080> well<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
all-in-all it's it does quite well I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.440 
all-in-all it's it does quite well I
have<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> 27<00:01:18.619> pound<00:01:19.619> thrust<00:01:20.180> mini<00:01:21.180> Kota

trolling<00:01:21.750> motor<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> honestly<00:01:23.040> at

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
trolling motor on here and honestly at

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.440 
trolling motor on here and honestly at
27<00:01:23.850> pound

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
27 pound

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.649 
27 pound
I'm<00:01:24.780> sorry<00:01:25.140> 28<00:01:25.680> pounds<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.939> bit<00:01:27.119> much<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
I'm sorry 28 pounds that's a bit much I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.399 
I'm sorry 28 pounds that's a bit much I
think<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.950> 20<00:01:29.640> pound<00:01:29.960> trolling<00:01:30.960> motor<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.320> be

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
think a 20 pound trolling motor would be

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.280 
think a 20 pound trolling motor would be
more<00:01:31.680> than<00:01:31.920> adequate<00:01:32.840> but<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.159> see

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
more than adequate but as you can see

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.910 
more than adequate but as you can see
its<00:01:37.290> first<00:01:37.710> second<00:01:39.140> when<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> open<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> all

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
its first second when you open it all

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
its first second when you open it all
the<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> puts<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> lot<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.119> force<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the way up it puts a lot of force on the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
the way up it puts a lot of force on the
back<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> moving<00:01:46.860> along<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.399> good

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
back so moving along at a pretty good

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.440 
back so moving along at a pretty good
clip

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
clip

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.719 
clip
my<00:01:50.260> opinion<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.740> think<00:01:50.770> that's<00:01:51.130> that's<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:51.550> bit

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
my opinion I think that's that's a bit

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:59.070 
my opinion I think that's that's a bit
much<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:55.950> did<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.190> together<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.180> lot<00:01:58.510> faster

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
much I did get it together a lot faster

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.050 
much I did get it together a lot faster
but<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.740> probably<00:01:59.979> had<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.430> together<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
but I probably had it together in the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.180 
but I probably had it together in the
water<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.420> about<00:02:01.600> ten<00:02:02.020> minutes<00:02:02.229> which<00:02:02.950> is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
water in about ten minutes which is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.330 
water in about ten minutes which is
pretty<00:02:03.700> good<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.330> if<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.770> decide<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.190> buy<00:02:06.310> a

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
pretty good and if you decide to buy a

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.130 
pretty good and if you decide to buy a
boat<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:07.119> definitely<00:02:07.810> want<00:02:08.080> to

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
boat like this you definitely want to

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.400 
boat like this you definitely want to
get<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.679> 12-volt<00:02:09.459> inflate<00:02:10.209> it's<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.170> little

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
get the 12-volt inflate it's a little

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.110 
get the 12-volt inflate it's a little
motor<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:12.040> they<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.520> plug<00:02:12.790> into<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
motor that they just plug into the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.140 
motor that they just plug into the
fort's<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:14.410> blows<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.950> up<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.430> did<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.060> by

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
fort's and it blows it up I did it by

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.300 
fort's and it blows it up I did it by
hand<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.570> first<00:02:16.720> time<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.290> took<00:02:17.470> ten<00:02:17.950> minutes

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
hand the first time it took ten minutes

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.680 
hand the first time it took ten minutes
