we're<00:00:08.060> talking<00:00:08.390> today<00:00:08.510> about<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:08.900> metabolic

we're talking today about the metabolic

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.920 
we're talking today about the metabolic

makeovers specifically how the five

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.710 
makeovers specifically how the five

reporting now again if you look at the
story<00:00:19.820> I<00:00:19.880> guess<00:00:20.090> we<00:00:20.240> should<00:00:20.420> start<00:00:20.510> with<00:00:20.689> level

think that's a good idea so let's talk
about<00:02:05.539> extra<00:02:06.109> about<00:02:06.679> adding<00:02:07.219> cellular

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
about extra about adding cellular

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.749 
about extra about adding cellular
renewal<00:02:08.390> by<00:02:09.170> improving<00:02:10.039> energy<00:02:10.250> production

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
renewal by improving energy production

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.510 
renewal by improving energy production
at<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.240> cell<00:02:11.480> level<00:02:11.660> that's<00:02:12.319> extras<00:02:12.920> primary

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
at the cell level that's extras primary

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.840 
at the cell level that's extras primary
benefit<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.270> finally<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.290> add<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.890> low<00:02:16.310> gold

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
benefit and finally you add a low gold

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.080 
benefit and finally you add a low gold
why<00:02:17.270> would<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.720> do<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.080> because<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.830> low

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
why would we do that because a low

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.880 
why would we do that because a low
synergizes<00:02:20.090> everything<00:02:21.050> like<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.740> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
synergizes everything like that like the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.490 
synergizes everything like that like the
conductor<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.580> symphony<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:23.420> low<00:02:23.690> works<00:02:24.290> to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
conductor of a symphony a low works to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.740 
conductor of a symphony a low works to
bring<00:02:24.680> all<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.310> together<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:26.030> enhances

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
bring all of that together it enhances

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.990 
bring all of that together it enhances
the<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.290> bioavailability<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:28.310> nutrients<00:02:28.910> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
the the bioavailability of nutrients and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.520 
the the bioavailability of nutrients and
the<00:02:29.150> supplements<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:29.900> your<00:02:29.990> diet

the supplements and in your diet

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.230 
the supplements and in your diet
it<00:02:30.860> protects<00:02:31.790> throughout<00:02:32.060> the
