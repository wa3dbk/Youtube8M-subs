00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.090
 everything is more childhood 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 against 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 good is a game that we have controlled 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.660
 from beginning to end 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.180
 we already had the victory 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.699
 we are down we are in the town hall 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.070
 but in 5 10 minutes the control of 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.010
 incomprehensibly match and the bosc 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 took the opportunity to start a minute of 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 nibali and the vows and visual and looked at the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.580
 session there is practically very little left 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.860
 there are five minutes left and the team 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.050
 of trying to do it between the cÃ©rvoles 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.610
 approaches the goal in a way 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.850
 little grill could not be and 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.850
 good 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:34.130
 and then it cost to think about services 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.130
 is that 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 i 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.720
 well sometimes this situation in football 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:15.450
 I can give any kind of 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:15.450
 explanation is not playing well 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.580
 normally we do not close the game and the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 opposite with many fewer occasions than 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.870
 us soccer 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.900
 and a lot and very much it makes us two goals and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.370
 get back in the encounter then 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.530
 Well, I say what 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.560
 with respect to the change, see if the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.769
 you do defensive because they put more 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.239
 defenses and give control to the contrary 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.129
 if you put them offensive 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.409
 international players 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.239
 as are the lid and seleznov the team does not 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.390
 it has to feel the contrary I think 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.620
 you have to raise the level by being 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.620
 in a state of greater 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.630
 homeland tribes and then review 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.160
 account also but as a summary I would say 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.480
 that has no explanation that ten 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.310
 minutes make us two goals because 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 because any team to do the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.120
 goals need a lot of time and many 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.850
 occasions and to us it has not been repeated 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.920
 this situation in the last matches and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.920
 good is a worrisome situation 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.830
 Y 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.659
 that is a but 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.320
 the measurement equipment that we see in what 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.320
 physical condition is we will decide when
