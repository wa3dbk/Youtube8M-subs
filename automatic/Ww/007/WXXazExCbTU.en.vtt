00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.980 
going on top of course so
you<00:02:13.620> don't<00:02:13.740> even<00:02:13.920> need<00:02:14.070> space<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.990> so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
you don't even need space for that so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.590 
you don't even need space for that so
I'm<00:02:16.260> gonna<00:02:16.440> hook<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.980> eight<00:02:17.190> speakers<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
I'm gonna hook up eight speakers the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.180 
I'm gonna hook up eight speakers the
other<00:02:18.840> nine<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> backend<00:02:19.590> going<00:02:20.070> do

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
other nine in the backend going do

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
other nine in the backend going do
nothing<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.000> connecting<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> at<00:02:21.690> all

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
nothing so I'm not connecting it at all

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.240 
nothing so I'm not connecting it at all
and<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.470> speakers<00:02:22.800> aren't<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> be

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and the speakers aren't going to be

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.110 
and the speakers aren't going to be
wired<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.670> series<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:25.110> gonna<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.410> dull<00:02:25.740> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
wired in series and it's gonna be dull I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.160 
wired in series and it's gonna be dull I
don't<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.240> if<00:02:27.390> there's<00:02:27.540> enough<00:02:27.810> power<00:02:27.990> but

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
don't know if there's enough power but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.840 
don't know if there's enough power but
sure<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.740> enough<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> get<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> loud<00:02:29.520> enough

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
sure it's enough to get it loud enough

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.370 
sure it's enough to get it loud enough
to<00:02:29.970> hear<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.350> jam<00:02:31.350> out<00:02:31.560> pretty<00:02:31.740> good<00:02:32.010> and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to hear and jam out pretty good and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.720 
to hear and jam out pretty good and
here's<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.620> system<00:02:35.070> right<00:02:35.190> here<00:02:35.250> all<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
here's the system right here all the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.420 
here's the system right here all the
equipment<00:02:36.590> except<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.860> handle<00:02:38.190> which<00:02:38.310> I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
equipment except for the handle which I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.680 
equipment except for the handle which I
want<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.760> created<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.240> handle<00:02:39.570> but

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
want to get created with the handle but

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.410 
want to get created with the handle but
I'll<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.620> after<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.190> done<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.610> do<00:02:42.000> have<00:02:42.300> to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
I'll do that after I'm done I do have to

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.930 
I'll do that after I'm done I do have to
glue<00:02:42.600> those<00:02:42.750> speakers<00:02:43.170> together<00:02:43.760> because<00:02:44.760> as

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
glue those speakers together because as

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.150 
glue those speakers together because as
you<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.240> both<00:02:45.450> speakers<00:02:46.020> do<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.770> chariot

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you know both speakers do to chariot

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.370 
you know both speakers do to chariot
over<00:02:47.370> time<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.880> bind<00:02:48.120> off<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.900> glue<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.260> so

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
over time and bind off the glue them so

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.890 
over time and bind off the glue them so
I'll<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.710> some<00:02:49.770> glue<00:02:50.540> but<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:51.750> is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I'll have to get some glue but here is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.260 
I'll have to get some glue but here is
stage<00:02:52.170> 2<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.070> can<00:02:53.340> see<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.910> parts

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
stage 2 which you can see all the parts

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.620 
stage 2 which you can see all the parts
and<00:02:55.160> there's<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.370> speaker<00:02:56.880> oh<00:02:59.510> you<00:03:00.510> don't

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
and there's the speaker oh you don't

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.290 
and there's the speaker oh you don't
think<00:03:00.750> later
