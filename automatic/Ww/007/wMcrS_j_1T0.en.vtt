short like really like tough spikes do
not<00:00:36.690> soft<00:00:37.020> clean<00:00:37.290> grows<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> tree<00:00:39.890> some<00:00:40.890> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
not soft clean grows in a tree some of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
not soft clean grows in a tree some of
them<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.160> could<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.460> two<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> seven<00:00:42.120> pounds

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

them they could get two to seven pounds
is<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> average<00:00:43.320> size<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:44.040> get

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is pretty much the average size they get

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.040 
is pretty much the average size they get
heavy<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.930> ones

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
heavy now we got three different ones

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.450 
heavy now we got three different ones
this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.739> we're<00:00:46.890> waiting<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
this is the one we're waiting for it to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.200 
this is the one we're waiting for it to
ripen<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> split<00:00:50.910> if

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
ripen and they kind of start to split if

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
ripen and they kind of start to split if
you<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> starts<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you could see that it starts to kind of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.400 
you could see that it starts to kind of
split<00:00:52.890> open<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.820> its<00:00:53.969> own<00:00:54.289> you've<00:00:55.289> been

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
keeping them outside because it does

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
keeping them outside because it does
