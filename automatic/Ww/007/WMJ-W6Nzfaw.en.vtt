00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.300 

that's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> Torquay<00:00:54.870> millimeter<00:00:55.230> ho

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.270 

just<00:00:59.940> switched<00:01:00.150> on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> odd<00:01:00.630> so<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.920> that's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just switched on the odd so and that's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.950 
just switched on the odd so and that's
just<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> pyrex<00:01:03.000> dish<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:06.200> for<00:01:07.200> cooking

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.010 
there's the burner nice cherry red color
very<00:01:31.810> hard<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.440> can<00:01:32.590> see<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.600> plate<00:01:34.869> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
very hard and you can see the plate is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.410 
very hard and you can see the plate is
absolutely<00:01:35.170> lifting<00:01:35.800> off<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.070> thing<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
absolutely lifting off this thing so

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:54.490 
absolutely lifting off this thing so
look

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:07.440 

probably<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:56.400> best<00:01:56.610> way<00:01:56.790> again

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.859 

okay<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.289> it's<00:02:08.619> been<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.950> for<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.869> few

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
okay so it's been going for a few

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.220 
okay so it's been going for a few
minutes<00:02:11.170> now<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:13.540> see<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.930> that's

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
minutes now and you can see that that's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
minutes now and you can see that that's
hecho<00:02:14.830> que<00:02:15.040> hay<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.030> 530<00:02:16.870> degrees<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.790> know

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
hecho que hay just 530 degrees I know

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.780 
hecho que hay just 530 degrees I know
what<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.239> in<00:02:19.330> Fahrenheit

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.080 

okay<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.569> this<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.260> Fahrenheit<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:28.250> goes<00:02:28.940> over

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
okay so this is Fahrenheit it goes over

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.970 
okay so this is Fahrenheit it goes over
Towson<00:02:29.599> degrees<00:02:29.810> Fahrenheit<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.470> seems<00:02:30.680> I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
Towson degrees Fahrenheit it seems I

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.100 
Towson degrees Fahrenheit it seems I
don't<00:02:31.940> know<00:02:32.000> 921<00:02:32.780> down<00:02:33.049> here<00:02:36.879> H<00:02:37.879> an<00:02:38.450> aqua<00:02:38.870> juice

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
don't know 921 down here H an aqua juice

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.430 
don't know 921 down here H an aqua juice
but<00:02:40.069> anyway<00:02:40.370> I'm<00:02:41.360> telling<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.840> now<00:02:42.019> this

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.500 
but anyway I'm telling you now this
gives<00:02:42.739> out<00:02:42.950> savage<00:02:43.220> another<00:02:43.640> heat<00:02:43.849> I<00:02:46.510> can't

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
gives out savage another heat I can't

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.320 
gives out savage another heat I can't
get<00:02:47.629> much<00:02:47.750> closer<00:02:47.989> not<00:02:48.260> let's<00:02:48.440> see<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:50.150> turn

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
get much closer not let's see I can turn

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.069 
get much closer not let's see I can turn
it<00:02:50.480> down<00:02:50.599> I'm<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.019> going<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:53.810> going
