00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.500
 Now let us ask John to read the Bible for us. 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.500
 Thank you 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.500
 Today our class is from the first book of Corinthians. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.100
 It contains very famous love articles 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.600
 When we think of God as love, this verse is revealed in a new way (1 John 4:16). 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.700
 At this moment, think about Him. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.400
 Love in all aspects is beyond perfection 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 This we can all read in 1 Corinthians 13 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.200
 So I will use a special version of the Bible today. 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.700
 It is called "The new version of the comprehensive self-annotation directly interprets the original original version of the Bible" 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900
 You want to hear it, let's get started. 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.800
 It is not a very popular version 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.000
 Because it is controversial about the interpretation of the Bible 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 But the Bible is inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16). 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.400
 Let us explain the scriptures in the scriptures. 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.800
 Then understand how the perfect god shows by example what is love 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.700
 We started from the fourth quarter 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 Love is patience, the Lord takes himself 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.200
 Wait patiently until he proves the death penalty for all human beings for the first time (Gen. 3:13, Rom. 5:12). 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.500
 Love is kindness, lovingly drowning the whole world (Genesis 6-8) 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.600
 Later, kindly sent wild animals such as lions and bears (1 Kings 20:36, 2 Kings 2:23-24, 17:25) 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.500
 To tear people into pieces, and to gracefully fall over the years 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.700
 Famine, plague, disease, and misfortune to different countries (Gen. 41:25-32, 21:1-14, Num. 11:3-34, 21:1, 2 Kings 8:1, 7-11) 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.900
 Love is not awkward, but he calls his name "bad" (ie jealous of other worshipped and respected gods) (Exodus 34:14) 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.200
 Jealousness is obviously different from jealousy and greed 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600
 They have nothing to do with jealousy. 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.500
 Jealousness is obviously a virtue worthy of appreciation 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.700
 We must do a good spiritual lesson to cultivate jealousy. 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.200
 Love is not boastful 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.100
 But God wants every page of the Bible 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.900
 Show off His power, greatness, grace, integrity, authority (Joshua 4:24, Psalm 63:2, 145:3, Job 37:22-23, 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.800
 (Isaiah 66:18-19 mourning 1:18, etc., actually open every page) 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 Also ask us to worship him as the Most High God (John 4:23-24, Rev. 4:11, Ps. 95, Eze. 46:2-3) 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.900
 (“Give the glory of the name of the Lord to him... worship Him”) (Psalm 29:2) 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.000
 Just to prove that he is not proud of himself 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.400
 Love is not a shy thing (that is, a shameful thing) 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.300
 Even the threat is to be smeared in the face of others (Malachi 2:3) 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 Love is not seeking your own benefits 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.400
 Just ask everyone to completely worship Him (Deut. 6:13, Matthew 28:17-20, Acts 17:24-31, Luke 9:23) 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.100
 (“No matter what you do, do it for the glory of God” 1 Corinthians 10:31) 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.000
 Also ask us to be wholehearted 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.300
 Fully obey Him in every aspect of life 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.400
 Love is not easy to get angry, usually well thought out 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.800
 Immediately hit the sinner to death (2 Sam. 6:6-7, Gen. 19:26, 38:3-10, Lev. 10:1-2) 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.400
 Love is not counting people's evil 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.100
 But...with a booklet, the exception 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.900
 a book specially used to write down the mistakes made by people 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.700
 (“The dead are judged according to what they have written in these books.” Revelation 20:12) 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.900
 So that He can teach them in the future 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.800
 A book like this is very practical in marriage. 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.700
 Love is not like unjust 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.600
 But it consists of letting the enemy flow into the river (Psalm 58:10). 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.000
 And hit the baby on the rock to get happiness. 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.200
 (“Bless your child fall on the rock, that man is blessed.” Psalm 137:9) 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.400
 Love is just like the truth 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.800
 Even sending out the Holy Spirit to mislead people (2 Thess. 2:11-12) 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.900
 Or seeing that the Bible is actually wrong, no exception. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 (The most simple example of talking about mistakes is Genesis (and the rest of the scriptures)) 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.700
 Love is all things tolerant (ie protect people) 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.500
 But exceptional when abandoning and attacking people (Judges 10:13-14, Deut. 28:15-68) 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.600
 Believe in everything, 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.900
 Exceptions to the tester (Gen 16:4, 22:1, 2:1-4, 32:31, 2:8) 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.200
 Looking forward to everything, 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.800
 I hope that you can suppress your rational doubts (Mark 12:29-30, Jer. 9:23-24, Luke 5:31-32, Rev. 20:10). 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.600
 So he doesn't need to send you to accept eternal punishment. 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.000
 Endure all things 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.600
 Forever, eternal, endless endurance 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.300
 (1 Cor. 11:31, Ps. 45:6, 4:17, 25:41, 46, 1:2:17, Rev. 14:11, 9:47-48, etc...) 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.300
 So that He can let those who love Him eternal worship of him. 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.900
 Other human beings will be punished and tortured forever. 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.100
 This is impulsive, sloppy, cruel, jealous, and boastful. 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.200
 Discourses that are ashamed, eager to be worshipped, and willful (but full of love) 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.600
 God, thank you for being so cruel, loving people, loving judgments and misleading people. 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.600
 (Source: The text in the Bible, as I just wrote) 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.300
 Friend, if you find out that she is not a virgin tonight 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.400
 We can help you throw stones at you tomorrow morning, everyone, right? (Deuteronomy 22:13-21) 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.400
 Amen 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.710
 Thanks John, now we stand up and sing the 45th poem.
