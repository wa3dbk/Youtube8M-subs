00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
things and that is how I wire power to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.109 
things and that is how I wire power to
my<00:00:14.009> tortoise<00:00:14.519> which<00:00:14.730> machine<00:00:15.379> so<00:00:16.430> what<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.670> I

went to radio shack and bought an
adjustable<00:00:22.859> voltage<00:00:23.840> transformer<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.460> plugged

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
adjustable voltage transformer I plugged

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.720 
adjustable voltage transformer I plugged
it<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.970> power<00:00:27.269> strip<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.189> I<00:00:29.189> set<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> on

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it into a power strip and I set it on

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.130 
it into a power strip and I set it on
seven<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.599> half<00:00:30.630> volts<00:00:31.289> i<00:00:32.870> bought<00:00:33.870> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
seven and a half volts i bought this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.130 
seven and a half volts i bought this
little<00:00:34.890> adapter<00:00:35.540> you<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> buy

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little adapter you don't have to buy

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.840 
little adapter you don't have to buy
that<00:00:37.380> adapter<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.309> cut<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> wire

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that adapter you can just cut the wire

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.970 
that adapter you can just cut the wire
and<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.559> know<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.890> wire<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.790> your

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
and you know just wire right into your

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.810 
and you know just wire right into your
wires<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> switch<00:00:44.850> machines<00:00:45.379> but<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
wires for the switch machines but I

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
wires for the switch machines but I
bought<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.329> adapter<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.899> plug<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
bought that little adapter to plug in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.040 
bought that little adapter to plug in
and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.950> split<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.489> into<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.780> feeder

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and then I split it into the feeder

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.220 
and then I split it into the feeder
wires<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.620> switch<00:00:52.920> machines<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
wires from switch machines and then the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.400 
wires from switch machines and then the
wires<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.829> run<00:00:56.070> down<00:00:56.219> each<00:00:56.489> table<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.410> just

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
wires just run down each table and just

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
wires just run down each table and just
tap<00:00:58.590> into<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.609> power<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.719> such

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
tap into it for your power from such

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.600 
tap into it for your power from such
machines<00:01:03.140> like<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.320> said<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> said<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.280> seven

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
machines like I said I said it for seven

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.859 
machines like I said I said it for seven
and<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> half<00:01:05.850> volts<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:10.140> uh<00:01:11.689> what<00:01:12.689> that

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and a half volts so that uh what that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.270 
and a half volts so that uh what that
does<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.369> power<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.610> pretty<00:01:14.939> slowly<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:16.409> I'll

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
does is power I'm pretty slowly and I'll

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.640 
does is power I'm pretty slowly and I'll
demonstrate<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:21.740> there<00:01:22.740> goes<00:01:23.040> nice<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.520> slow

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
demonstrate it there goes nice and slow

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.819 
demonstrate it there goes nice and slow
looks<00:01:25.650> good<00:01:26.009> sounds<00:01:26.820> nice<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:30.320> have<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> double

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
looks good sounds nice I have a double

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
looks good sounds nice I have a double
cross<00:01:32.040> over<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.520> power<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
cross over here and I just power to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:47.490 
cross over here and I just power to
machines<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.439> switch

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.140 

that's<00:01:48.500> how<00:01:48.710> i<00:01:48.740> did<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.040> i<00:01:49.400> got<00:01:49.580> one<00:01:49.820> on<00:01:49.970> this

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
that's how i did that i got one on this

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.560 
that's how i did that i got one on this
end<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:52.250> one<00:01:52.460> on<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.760> end<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:58.420> another<00:01:59.420> thing

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
end the one on this end so another thing
