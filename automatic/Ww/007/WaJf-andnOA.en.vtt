and a protein powder so I get the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.939 
and a protein powder so I get the
protein<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.019> day<00:00:25.140> when<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> start<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> day

and I lost 24 pounds and I got back to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.299 
and I lost 24 pounds and I got back to
basically<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> wait<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.210> high<00:00:33.360> school<00:00:34.309> but

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
basically what I wait in high school but

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
basically what I wait in high school but
I<00:00:35.370> did<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.149> different<00:00:36.300> reason<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
I did it for a different reason but I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.630 
I did it for a different reason but I
mean<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> lose<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.370> weight<00:00:38.489> but

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
mean I want to lose a little weight but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.470 
mean I want to lose a little weight but
I<00:00:39.120> didn't<00:00:39.629> dream<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.320> happen<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.480> did

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
I didn't dream this would happen I did

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.889 
I didn't dream this would happen I did
it<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:43.730> after<00:00:44.730> i<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> stint<00:00:45.629> put<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it because after i had this stint put in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.220 
it because after i had this stint put in
I<00:00:46.760> realized<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.940> even<00:00:48.420> though<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> happens

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I realized that even though it happens

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.610 
I realized that even though it happens
quite<00:00:49.379> often<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> after<00:00:50.870> he<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> bypasses

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
quite often that after he have bypasses

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
quite often that after he have bypasses
you<00:00:52.860> lose<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> veins<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.910> they're

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you lose the veins because they're

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.750 
you lose the veins because they're
thinner<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> weaker<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:55.079> arteries<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
thinner and weaker than arteries the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
thinner and weaker than arteries the
truth<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.660> clogged<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.190> which<00:00:59.190> means

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
truth is that it clogged up which means

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.250 
truth is that it clogged up which means
that<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.910> cholesterol<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.570> still<00:01:00.780> calling

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that the cholesterol was still calling

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.219 
that the cholesterol was still calling
buildup<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.539> vein<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.899> part<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> my

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
buildup in my vein it was part of my

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
bypassed oh and thank God I could take

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.000

the<00:01:07.350> stents<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> happen<00:01:09.119> again

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
the stents I don't want to happen again

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
the stents I don't want to happen again
so<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> did<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.490> research<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.270> saw

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so I did all this research and I saw

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.789 
so I did all this research and I saw
