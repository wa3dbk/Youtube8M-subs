00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.130
 tom how to record a song at home 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.699
 conditions that is about home studio 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.439
 sound recordings roughly speaking in the past 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 lessons I talked about how to write 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.480
 drum about how to record bases and read 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 a small introductory lecture on general 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.150
 sound recordings at home at home 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 recording budget i.e. without 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.660
 strong big global huge 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.809
 costs here in this release I want you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 talk about how to record a guitar and 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.210
 so friends as i said i'm a little bit 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.100
 I repeat that an hour 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:52.079
 record guitar if you use 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.960
 gam guitar is desirable through the net 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 sound that is only taking advantage of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 wire connect the wiring to the guitar 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 connect the dock right your sound 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.329
 card if you have an external sound card 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 and it may even have an entrance for 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.840
 guitars separately that is the input which 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 will probably be a small preamp 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 here are the ones like line 6 online sex 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 online then what else is there m-audio they have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.380
 there are such sound cards too 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
 many now all sorts of Chinese fakes 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.150
 too 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 guitar inputs separately and for 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 microphone, too, separately, respectively 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.720
 here but if you use the built-in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 sound card like me also sound 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.150
 card for a laptop then you just stick it in 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 your wire in the mic input or in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.810
 linear if you have it I don't have 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.790
 linear so only mic 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 and I remove the gain 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.860
 There is in the settings there microphone gain 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.799
 I clean it too and actually 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.799
 just recording straight straight into the guitar 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.950
 rig where I already exhibit everything 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.560
 combo amps 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.780
 and everything else is the most important 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.290
 guitar recording feature is that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.770
 need to record a few takes for what 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.130
 everything is very simple for thick sound 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.100
 of course you can immediately once for 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.040
 write and pile combo there the most 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 drive the most power more bass for more 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.850
 total you will have tram chic sound but 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.140
 actually in the mix this sound 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.890
 lose because he will 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.690
 uninteresting but if you write down 3 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.350
 let's track one on light over 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.300
 drive to another is also possible to 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.070
 overdrive but through another combo through 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.650
 a little bit different sound 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.840
 lead one to the right and ear to the other 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.790
 left ear and in the middle are you anything 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.550
 also write more more maybe 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.670
 tough but not too tough one can 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.100
 in general what is the right left almost on 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.640
 clear sound to record with just a clang 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.160
 with such that you have in total it will give 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.870
 awesome effect awesome effect because 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.940
 what you can't play 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.530
 every time is exactly the same 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.690
 equally that is you will have a small 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.140
 imposing all the same it will also give 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.450
 awesome effect of horus such 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.720
 so this is one of the main aspects 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.920
 guitar recording is doblo doblo need 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440
 write and 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.950
 You can also write us to the salon 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.080
 w 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.730
 but I don’t know well, maybe it’s worth it too 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.490
 it all depends on what song and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.440
 do you need a dense solo sound there for example 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.270
 such a light is needed 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.350
 Also do not forget your friends about what 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.150
 guitars can be used as a kind 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.920
 placeholder space that is possible 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.120
 to wind awesome doing 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.130
 roar and just play 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.790
 such light notes but that is all 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.159
 background sounded and 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.599
 a little quieter in the mix do it 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.590
 it will be wonderful just 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.319
 Well, actually we will deal with this now 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.540
 everything is already screwed up will be in the last 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.189
 probably learned in the intelligence where we 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.430
 hear the final material 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:12.329
 so let's go write guitar let's go 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:16.190
 friends are with me I will not torture you 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.650
 recording all of the double of i just show 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.479
 one record option and plus the one under 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.479
 a spoon which basis I spoke 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:29.720
 filling the whole atmosphere of your song 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.720
 So I went and all the intricate 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.510
 Well, somehow I wrote it down now 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.850
 the main part of the guitar and and i will lose 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.660
 two times I will not write it in it 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.090
 see at the very end now I 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.770
 I will write the very one under the spoon creating 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.660
 the atmosphere will need to be 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.720
 screw and willow 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.070
 roar like someone who says chorus 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.070
 to be further 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.110
 but 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.169
 but 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.580
 unexpectedly cool happened 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.530
 so here are friends without overloading the guitar 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.449
 wild what kind of amplifier we would write 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.900
 their three light doblo which 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:12.199
 turned this just meat made 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.180
 and naturally here's a spoon she just 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.580
 chic i think she's gorgeous i love 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.160
 such songs and actually i'm from them 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.870
 feel it would be amazing myself would not 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.180
 loved my songs it would be weird 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.430
