00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.269 
cinema4d a lot of people don't well I
think<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.859> there's<00:00:23.010> many

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
think now they do because there's many

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.410 
think now they do because there's many
tutorials<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:23.970> it

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
tutorials about it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.160 
tutorials about it
but<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:26.070> quick<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> render

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
but it's just really quick the render

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.450 
but it's just really quick the render
settings<00:00:28.410> I'm<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.039> give<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.279> some

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
settings I'm just going to give you some

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.010 
settings I'm just going to give you some
recommended<00:00:29.939> render<00:00:30.599> settings<00:00:32.719> one<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.870> those

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
recommended render settings one of those

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.310 
recommended render settings one of those
I'll<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.920> show<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.130> my<00:00:35.640> preset<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.600> need<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
I'll just show you my preset I need to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.299 
I'll just show you my preset I need to
make<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> new<00:00:37.739> preset<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:40.010> there's<00:00:41.010> some

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
make a new preset because there's some

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.080 
make a new preset because there's some
other<00:00:42.090> things<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.660> add<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
other things I need to add to it so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.310 
other things I need to add to it so
basically<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> ambient

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
basically what I use is ambient

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
basically what I use is ambient
occlusion<00:00:46.500> which<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.489> shadows<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.570> then

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
occlusion which is shadows and then

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
occlusion which is shadows and then
global<00:00:49.559> global<00:00:50.370> illumination<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:52.070> when<00:00:53.070> if

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
global global illumination which when if

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
global global illumination which when if
you<00:00:53.309> put<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> light<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.940> it'll<00:00:54.649> show

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you put a light in it'll show

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.660 
you put a light in it'll show
reflections<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:56.760> it'll<00:00:57.510> UM<00:00:58.520> sample<00:00:59.520> all

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
reflections and then it'll UM sample all

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.630 
reflections and then it'll UM sample all
around<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.469> make<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.500> better<00:01:01.920> than<00:01:02.250> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
around it and make it better than just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
around it and make it better than just
the<00:01:03.510> regular<00:01:05.450> thing<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.930> actually

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the regular thing right here actually

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
the regular thing right here actually
it's<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> show<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.580> mine

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it's not going to show up for mine

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's not going to show up for mine
because<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> render<00:01:09.750> settings<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> say

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
because of the render settings so say

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
because of the render settings so say
you<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.070> usually<00:01:14.909> whenever

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you want to you want usually whenever

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
you want to you want usually whenever
people<00:01:15.420> render<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.049> there's<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> black

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
people render out there's a black

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
people render out there's a black
background<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:19.170> between

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
background right here or in between

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
background right here or in between
these<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.400> obviously<00:01:21.119> annoying<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> get

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
these which is obviously annoying to get

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.789 
these which is obviously annoying to get
out<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> logo<00:01:23.850> part

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
whenever I first started or whenever I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.039 
whenever I first started or whenever I
first<00:01:28.140> started<00:01:28.439> using<00:01:28.710> cinema<00:01:29.250> 4d<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:30.630> always

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
first started using cinema 4d I always

first started using cinema 4d I always
get<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> black<00:01:32.220> background<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.180> never

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
get that black background and I never

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.580 
get that black background and I never
knew<00:01:33.630> how<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:35.030> well<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
knew how to get it out well get just the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
knew how to get it out well get just the
logo<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.460> whatever<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.090> rendering<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
logo or whatever I was rendering out so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.889 
logo or whatever I was rendering out so
a<00:01:41.009> simple<00:01:42.000> fix<00:01:42.150> here<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> save<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.950> then

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
a simple fix here is go to save and then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.170 
a simple fix here is go to save and then
click<00:01:45.899> alpha<00:01:46.350> channel<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.909> even

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
click alpha channel and then some even

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
click alpha channel and then some even
hit<00:01:48.509> straight<00:01:49.049> alpha<00:01:49.350> channel<00:01:49.680> which<00:01:49.890> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
hit straight alpha channel which I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.080 
hit straight alpha channel which I
sometimes<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:52.430> but<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> gonna<00:01:53.970> be

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sometimes do but this is like gonna be
