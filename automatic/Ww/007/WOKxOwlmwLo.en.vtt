spray like that no you pump it up you

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.880 
spray like that no you pump it up you
pump<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.910> up<00:02:17.060> until<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:17.870> feel<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.769> you

have enough pressure and you pump it up

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.300 
have enough pressure and you pump it up
some<00:02:20.510> more<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:21.319> prior<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:22.040> little

valve I hear popping up right there now

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.920 
valve I hear popping up right there now
it<00:02:31.760> doesn't<00:02:31.970> necessarily<00:02:32.299> have<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> pop<00:02:32.720> up

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
it doesn't necessarily have to pop up

but I'm just saying you have to put

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.699 
but I'm just saying you have to put
sufficient<00:02:34.250> pressure<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.060> there<00:02:35.329> now<00:02:35.930> here's

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
sufficient pressure in there now here's

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.789 
sufficient pressure in there now here's
the<00:02:36.920> secret<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:38.269> order<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.720> get<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.260> perfect

your project you have to purge the air
out<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.590> important<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.160> have<00:02:49.370> a

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
out and it's important that you have a

enough to be able to accommodate the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.710 
enough to be able to accommodate the
flow<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:55.489> most<00:02:55.700> important<00:02:56.120> thing<00:02:56.239> again<00:02:56.510> is

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
flow the most important thing again is

flow the most important thing again is
to<00:02:57.170> remember<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.040> purge<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:59.030> air<00:02:59.269> out<00:02:59.599> just

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
to remember to purge the air out just

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.240 
to remember to purge the air out just
like<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:02.019> now<00:03:03.019> just<00:03:03.319> because<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.650> purge<00:03:04.010> it

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
like this now just because you purge it

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.280 
like this now just because you purge it
right<00:03:04.430> there<00:03:04.640> doesn't<00:03:05.540> mean<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.079> you're

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
right there doesn't mean that you're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.940 
right there doesn't mean that you're
ready<00:03:07.040> let<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.850> sit<00:03:08.030> there<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.239> few<00:03:08.450> seconds

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
ready let it sit there a few seconds

ready let it sit there a few seconds
there's<00:03:09.950> plenty<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.370> material<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:10.940> there

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
there's plenty of material in there

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.020 
there's plenty of material in there
remember<00:03:12.319> one<00:03:12.500> gallon<00:03:12.859> will<00:03:12.950> go<00:03:13.040> about<00:03:13.190> 450<00:03:13.940> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
remember one gallon will go about 450 to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.390 
remember one gallon will go about 450 to
500<00:03:14.510> square<00:03:14.569> feet<00:03:14.930> once<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.130> air<00:03:16.370> is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
500 square feet once the air is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900 
500 square feet once the air is
completely<00:03:17.329> out<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.319> system<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
completely out of the system then you

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.599 
completely out of the system then you
bring<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.569> out<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.319> start<00:03:22.099> your<00:03:22.220> spray

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
spraying never let go of the trigger if

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.039 
spraying never let go of the trigger if
you<00:03:36.260> have<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.950> let<00:03:37.099> go<00:03:37.370> let<00:03:37.910> someone<00:03:38.239> hold<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
into the bucket and let go that way your

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.349 
into the bucket and let go that way your
droplets<00:03:44.810> fall<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.260> there<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.790> start<00:03:47.120> over

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
droplets fall in there to start over

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.659 
droplets fall in there to start over
again<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.319> have<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.099> same<00:03:49.370> thing

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
again you have to do the same thing

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.150 
again you have to do the same thing
start<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.419> here<00:03:50.720> wait<00:03:51.410> till<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.680> stops<00:03:51.919> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
start in here wait till it stops the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.610 
start in here wait till it stops the
droplets<00:03:52.639> bring<00:03:53.419> it<00:03:53.569> out<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.959> start<00:03:54.290> spraying

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
droplets bring it out and start spraying

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.589 
droplets bring it out and start spraying
some<00:03:54.950> more<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.090> way<00:03:56.269> you'll<00:03:56.419> have<00:03:56.450> a

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
some more and this way you'll have a

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.379 
some more and this way you'll have a
perfect<00:03:57.079> floor<00:03:57.290> no<00:03:57.530> droplets<00:03:58.120> bring<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.239> in

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
perfect floor no droplets bring it in

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.400 
perfect floor no droplets bring it in
let<00:03:59.750> go<00:04:00.160> okay<00:04:01.160> you<00:04:01.790> do<00:04:01.940> not<00:04:02.120> start<00:04:02.540> spray<00:04:03.139> here

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
let go okay you do not start spray here

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.170 
let go okay you do not start spray here
and<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.950> way<00:04:04.069> to<00:04:04.099> the<00:04:04.250> bucket<00:04:04.579> let<00:04:04.760> go<00:04:04.940> and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
and on the way to the bucket let go and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.550 
and on the way to the bucket let go and
bring<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:05.480> in<00:04:05.660> because<00:04:06.139> then<00:04:06.290> you'll<00:04:06.380> have<00:04:06.500> a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
bring it in because then you'll have a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.920 
bring it in because then you'll have a
series<00:04:06.919> of<00:04:06.950> droplets<00:04:07.519> along<00:04:07.669> the<00:04:07.940> way<00:04:08.120> it's

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
series of droplets along the way it's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.920 
series of droplets along the way it's
always<00:04:09.169> start<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.950> stop<00:04:10.609> inside<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.750> bucket

a<00:04:12.319> lot<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.400> people<00:04:13.610> say<00:04:13.849> all<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.180> sprayer

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
a lot of people say all the sprayer

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.980 
a lot of people say all the sprayer
drips<00:04:15.049> all<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.379> time

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
drips all the time

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.390 
drips all the time
the<00:04:16.140> sprayer<00:04:16.380> does<00:04:16.560> not<00:04:16.710> drip<00:04:16.950> all<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.220> time

the sprayer does not drip all the time

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.860 
the sprayer does not drip all the time
it's<00:04:17.610> just<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.940> don't<00:04:18.060> know<00:04:18.150> how<00:04:18.360> to<00:04:18.420> use<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
it's just you don't know how to use the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.870 
it's just you don't know how to use the

sprayer the correct way to use the
sprayer<00:04:21.210> is<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:22.020> start<00:04:22.350> in<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> bucket<00:04:23.040> purrs

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310

remember<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.580> sprayer<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.180> fantastic<00:04:49.080> if<00:04:49.800> you

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
remember the sprayer is fantastic if you

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.040 
remember the sprayer is fantastic if you

it<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.500> not<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.830> sprayers<00:04:53.160> fault

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
it it's not the sprayers fault

it it's not the sprayers fault
it's<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.240> operators<00:04:54.750> fault<00:04:55.050> because<00:04:55.260> he's

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
it's the operators fault because he's

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.760 
it's the operators fault because he's
not<00:04:55.530> following<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:56.010> right<00:04:56.190> technique

not following the right technique
remember<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:58.950> is<00:04:59.160> not<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.550> start<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.060> stop

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
remember this is not a start and stop

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.600 
remember this is not a start and stop
technique<00:05:00.840> like<00:05:01.050> an<00:05:01.200> acid<00:05:01.560> stain<00:05:01.800> if<00:05:02.100> this

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
technique like an acid stain if this

technique like an acid stain if this
were<00:05:02.760> an<00:05:02.880> acid<00:05:03.240> stain<00:05:03.480> this<00:05:03.690> is<00:05:03.900> what<00:05:04.080> would

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
were an acid stain this is what would

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.980 
were an acid stain this is what would
happen<00:05:04.650> if<00:05:05.160> you're<00:05:05.910> spraying<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.480> an<00:05:06.660> acid

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
happen if you're spraying like an acid

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.410 
happen if you're spraying like an acid
stain<00:05:07.230> you<00:05:07.470> would<00:05:07.650> spray<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.610> every<00:05:09.090> time<00:05:09.300> you

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
stain you would spray and every time you

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.200 
stain you would spray and every time you
let<00:05:09.600> go<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.320> have<00:05:10.470> droplets<00:05:11.010> coming<00:05:11.760> out<00:05:11.940> see

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
let go you have droplets coming out see

those<00:05:12.330> droplets<00:05:12.540> falling<00:05:12.930> okay<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:13.920> spray

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
those droplets falling okay you spray

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.400 
those droplets falling okay you spray
again<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.820> then<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.390> let<00:05:15.540> go<00:05:15.690> there's<00:05:16.260> some
