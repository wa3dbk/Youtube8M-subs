00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
exactly what the extraction tab is used

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.969 
exactly what the extraction tab is used
for<00:01:38.820> well<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> main<00:01:40.590> things<00:01:40.619> you're

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
going to be doing in the extraction tab

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.530 
going to be doing in the extraction tab
is<00:01:42.810> turning<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.500> or<00:01:43.740> into<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.329> got

is turning your or into you know in got

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
is turning your or into you know in got
to<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:46.290> armed<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.340> once<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to make it into armed so once you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.149 
to make it into armed so once you
extractor<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:48.810> n<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.409> multiples<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
extractor or into n got in multiples of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.679 
extractor or into n got in multiples of
10<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.790> how<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.000> works<00:01:51.180> you're

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
10 because that's how it works you're

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
10 because that's how it works you're
going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> come<00:01:51.990> back<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> material<00:01:52.950> menu

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
going to come back to the material menu

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.330 
going to come back to the material menu
now<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> material<00:01:54.659> menu<00:01:55.229> works<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.680> based

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
now how the material menu works is based

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.209 
now how the material menu works is based
on<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> number<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> bars<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:58.219> increases

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
on the number of bars you use increases

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.760 
on the number of bars you use increases
the<00:01:59.610> level<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.990> armor<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:01.680> going

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the level of the armor that you're going

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.300 
the level of the armor that you're going
to<00:02:01.860> make<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:03.149> turn<00:02:03.390> increases<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.439> armor

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
to make and in turn increases the armor

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.850 
to make and in turn increases the armor
value<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> move<00:02:07.439> through<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
value now as you move through the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580 
value now as you move through the
materials<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> progress<00:02:09.440> you're<00:02:10.440> going

already<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.800> you'll<00:03:26.580> be<00:03:26.760> able<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.120> select

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
already on it you'll be able to select

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.000 
already on it you'll be able to select
it<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.840> as<00:03:27.990> soon<00:03:28.170> as<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.290> select<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.710> it<00:03:28.890> will

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
it and as soon as you select it it will

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.850 
it and as soon as you select it it will
give<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> countdown<00:03:29.820> timer<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:31.650> is

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
give you a countdown timer and that is

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.350 
give you a countdown timer and that is
the<00:03:31.890> amount<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.490> time<00:03:32.700> until<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.150> fully

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
the amount of time until it's fully

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.840 
the amount of time until it's fully
research<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:35.010> process<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.670> will

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
research so in this process it will

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.570 
research so in this process it will
destroy<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.600> item<00:03:36.990> you<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:38.070> armor<00:03:38.400> or

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
destroy the item you know armor or

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.490 
destroy the item you know armor or
weapons<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:39.240> in<00:03:39.390> turn<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:40.050> will<00:03:40.410> allow<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.370> to

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
weapons but in turn it will allow you to

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.530 
weapons but in turn it will allow you to
create<00:03:43.500> gear<00:03:44.040> with<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.700> specific<00:03:44.880> trait<00:03:45.420> that

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
create gear with the specific trait that

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.790 
create gear with the specific trait that
your<00:03:45.690> research<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.230> yeah<00:03:46.350> you're<00:03:46.500> going<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.680> be

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
your research so yeah you're going to be

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.640 
your research so yeah you're going to be
sacrificing<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.360> know<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> piece<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.810> gear<00:03:49.260> for

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
sacrificing you know a piece of gear for

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.350 
sacrificing you know a piece of gear for
research<00:03:50.070> but<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.700> long<00:03:50.910> term<00:03:51.120> you're

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
research but in the long term you're

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.699 
research but in the long term you're
going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.600> able<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.810> use<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.110> trait

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
going to be able to use that trait

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.440 
going to be able to use that trait
that's<00:03:53.130> going<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.430> benefit<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.000> more<00:03:54.240> than

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
that's going to benefit you more than

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.300 
that's going to benefit you more than
that<00:03:54.600> one<00:03:54.870> piece<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.260> armor<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.130> now<00:03:56.250> you're

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
that one piece of armor so now you're

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.560 
that one piece of armor so now you're
going<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.520> see<00:03:56.640> me<00:03:56.760> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.209> extraction

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
going to see me going to the extraction

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.470 
going to see me going to the extraction
tab<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.640> another<00:03:59.640> cool<00:03:59.910> thing<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.360> can

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
tab and another cool thing that you can

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.220 
tab and another cool thing that you can
do<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.230> can<00:04:01.260> break<00:04:01.770> down<00:04:01.800> gear<00:04:02.520> for

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
do is you can break down gear for

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.100 
do is you can break down gear for
materials<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> extraction<00:04:04.950> tab<00:04:06.110> another

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
materials in the extraction tab another

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.010 
materials in the extraction tab another
port<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.500> tab<00:04:07.770> is<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.100> improvement<00:04:08.820> tab<00:04:09.020> now

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
port in tab is the improvement tab now

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.290 
port in tab is the improvement tab now
the<00:04:10.080> primary<00:04:10.440> use<00:04:10.770> of<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:11.130> tab<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.670> going<00:04:12.209> to

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
the primary use of this tab is going to

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.320 
the primary use of this tab is going to
be<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.660> improve<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.920> rarity<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.000> items

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
be to improve the rarity of the items

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.699 
be to improve the rarity of the items
that<00:04:15.480> you've<00:04:15.600> created<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.530> have

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
that you've created so you here I have

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.390 
that you've created so you here I have
some<00:04:16.739> items<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.220> made<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:19.590> one<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.920> a<00:04:19.950> basic

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
some items I made this one is a basic

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.670 
some items I made this one is a basic
rarity<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.880> know<00:04:20.970> normal<00:04:21.450> however<00:04:22.169> with<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
rarity you know normal however with the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.170 
rarity you know normal however with the
use<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:22.979> these<00:04:23.280> special<00:04:23.700> items<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.150> can

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
use of these special items I can

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.610 
use of these special items I can
increase<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.750> rarity

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
increase the rarity

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.800 
increase the rarity
and<00:04:25.740> as<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.790> can<00:04:26.910> see<00:04:26.940> there's<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.330> percent

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
and as you can see there's a percent

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.370 
and as you can see there's a percent
chance<00:04:28.110> there<00:04:28.530> now<00:04:28.979> as<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.460> add<00:04:29.669> more<00:04:30.380> of

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
chance there now as you add more of

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.659 
chance there now as you add more of
these<00:04:31.620> items<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.669> increase<00:04:33.090> your<00:04:33.270> chance<00:04:33.660> of

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
these items you increase your chance of

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.490 
these items you increase your chance of
improving<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:36.000> rarity<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.720> item<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.350> it's

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
improving the rarity of the item so it's

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.040 
improving the rarity of the item so it's
somewhat<00:04:37.830> like<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.040> gamble<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:39.630> less<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.840> use

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
somewhat like a gamble the less you use

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.710 
somewhat like a gamble the less you use
the<00:04:40.470> less<00:04:40.650> chance<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.490> have<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:41.720> improving

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
the less chance you have of improving

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.110 
the less chance you have of improving
its<00:04:42.900> rarity<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.860> most<00:04:44.070> part<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.580> normally<00:04:44.940> go

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
its rarity the most part I normally go

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.939 
its rarity the most part I normally go
you<00:04:45.360> know<00:04:45.510> one<00:04:45.990> hundred<00:04:46.260> percent<00:04:46.290> if<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.770> have

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
you know one hundred percent if I have

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.530 
you know one hundred percent if I have
the<00:04:47.130> if<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.430> have<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.639> I'll<00:04:47.970> go<00:04:48.180> one<00:04:48.300> hundred

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
the if I have it I'll go one hundred

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.150 
the if I have it I'll go one hundred
percent<00:04:48.570> because<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.410> don't<00:04:49.590> want<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> risk<00:04:49.889> it

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
percent because I don't want to risk it

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.129 
percent because I don't want to risk it
you<00:04:50.699> know<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:51.270> not<00:04:51.360> really<00:04:51.540> worth<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.960> and

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
you know it's not really worth it and

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.469 
you know it's not really worth it and
the<00:04:52.800> reason<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:53.130> say<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.610> because<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:54.300> can

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
the reason I say that is because you can

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.080 
the reason I say that is because you can
lose<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.900> item<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.620> know<00:04:55.740> if<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.010> doesn't<00:04:56.400> you

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
lose the item you know if it doesn't you

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.300 
lose the item you know if it doesn't you
know<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.300> chance<00:04:57.630> is<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.889> item<00:04:59.160> will

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
know the chance is that the item will

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.939 
know the chance is that the item will
come<00:04:59.490> through<00:04:59.729> and<00:04:59.880> become<00:05:00.270> a<00:05:00.510> more<00:05:01.289> rare<00:05:01.620> type

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
come through and become a more rare type

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.189 
come through and become a more rare type
of<00:05:01.979> that<00:05:02.220> item<00:05:02.400> but<00:05:03.060> if<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.720> doesn't<00:05:03.930> go

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
of that item but if it doesn't go

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.750 
of that item but if it doesn't go
through<00:05:04.229> you're<00:05:04.710> gonna<00:05:04.830> lose<00:05:05.100> that<00:05:05.160> item<00:05:05.580> it's

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
through you're gonna lose that item it's

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.670
