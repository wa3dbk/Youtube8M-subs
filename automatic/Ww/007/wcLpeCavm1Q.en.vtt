so<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.039> more<00:00:17.279> complicated<00:00:17.789> coordinated

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so here is more complicated coordinated

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.929 
so here is more complicated coordinated
groove<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> 16<00:00:20.130> old<00:00:20.279> high<00:00:20.400> hat<00:00:20.580> pattern

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
groove with the 16 old high hat pattern

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.840 
groove with the 16 old high hat pattern
and<00:00:21.869> good<00:00:22.830> showmanship<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> always<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> matter

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
and good showmanship is always a matter

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
and good showmanship is always a matter
of<00:00:23.970> coordination<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.689> course<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.050> practice

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
of coordination of course and practice

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.890 
of coordination of course and practice
but<00:00:26.550> always<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:27.090> sure<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.480> your<00:00:27.599> plane

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
but always make sure that your plane

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
but always make sure that your plane
does<00:00:28.170> never<00:00:28.380> suffer<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:29.760> your<00:00:29.970> showmanship

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
does never suffer from your showmanship

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
does never suffer from your showmanship
it's<00:00:30.630> completely<00:00:31.109> irrelevant<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.859> you're

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's completely irrelevant if you're

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
it's completely irrelevant if you're
playing<00:00:32.579> suffers<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.510> doesn't<00:00:33.840> make<00:00:33.930> any

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
playing suffers it doesn't make any

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.569 
playing suffers it doesn't make any
sense<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> should<00:00:35.160> rather<00:00:35.370> not

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
sense at all and you should rather not

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.170 
sense at all and you should rather not
do<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.770> here's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.180> complicated

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
do that so here's a more complicated

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:56.890 
do that so here's a more complicated
groove<00:00:39.540> goes<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.559> this

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.330 

okay<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.020> next<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:59.900> a<00:01:00.900> throw<00:01:01.470> not<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.860> twirl

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
okay the next one is a throw not a twirl

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
okay the next one is a throw not a twirl
but<00:01:02.580> an<00:01:02.670> actual<00:01:02.850> throw<00:01:03.330> I<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.200> use<00:01:04.380> these

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but an actual throw I like to use these

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.200 
but an actual throw I like to use these
a<00:01:04.590> lot<00:01:04.740> because<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.160> just<00:01:05.309> looks<00:01:05.580> great<00:01:05.940> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a lot because it just looks great and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
a lot because it just looks great and
here's<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.870> simple<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.410> on<00:01:07.620> using<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.610> call

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
here's a very simple one on using I call

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.720 
here's a very simple one on using I call
this<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> offbeat<00:01:09.600> throw<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.520> doing

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
this the offbeat throw and I'm doing

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:22.930 
this the offbeat throw and I'm doing
that<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.910> the<00:01:12.000> high<00:01:12.150> hand<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.780> goes<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.050> this

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.190 

when<00:01:23.940> you<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> I'll<00:01:24.690> practice<00:01:25.050> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
when you do this I'll practice this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.020 
when you do this I'll practice this
remember<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> always<00:01:25.979> catch<00:01:26.370> on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> beat

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
remember to always catch on the beat

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.990 
remember to always catch on the beat
that's<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.050> trick<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> remember<00:01:29.700> when

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that's a trick you have to remember when

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.520 
that's a trick you have to remember when
you<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.390> lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.660> threads<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.170> always<00:01:31.380> want

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
you do a lot of threads you always want

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.580 
you do a lot of threads you always want
to<00:01:31.590> catch<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.670> beat<00:01:32.900> okay<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.440> want

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to catch on the beat okay and you want

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
to catch on the beat okay and you want
to<00:01:34.680> catch<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.190> do<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> movement<00:01:35.910> in<00:01:36.090> time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to catch and do the movement in time

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.109 
to catch and do the movement in time
even<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> sticks<00:01:37.530> flying<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> air<00:01:38.400> make

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
even if it sticks flying in the air make

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.580 
even if it sticks flying in the air make
sure<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.390> throw<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.350> catch

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
sure you throw it up in time you catch

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
sure you throw it up in time you catch
it<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:40.920> time<00:01:40.950> okay<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.600> helps<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it in time okay that really helps the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
it in time okay that really helps the
whole<00:01:43.140> process<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.619> working<00:01:44.400> these<00:01:44.670> tricks

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
whole process of working these tricks

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.780 
whole process of working these tricks
into<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.390> playing<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.400> catch<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:49.110> beat

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
into your playing so I catch on the beat

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.050 
into your playing so I catch on the beat
he's<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.940> pattern<00:01:51.180> against<00:01:51.420> low<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.940> can

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
he's the pattern against low as you can

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.950 
he's the pattern against low as you can
see<00:01:57.330> catching<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.289> bead

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.860 

I<00:02:10.030> also<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.330> use<00:02:11.600> twirls<00:02:12.020> when<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> play

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
I also like to use twirls when I play

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.960 
I also like to use twirls when I play
more<00:02:14.950> holistic<00:02:15.950> kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.490> stuff<00:02:16.670> around<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
more holistic kind of stuff around the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.900 
more holistic kind of stuff around the
drums<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:17.690> what<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.350> usually<00:02:18.590> do<00:02:18.920> then<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.700> use

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
drums so what I usually do then is I use

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.760 
drums so what I usually do then is I use
the<00:02:20.120> real<00:02:20.360> twirl<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.319> I<00:02:21.350> showed<00:02:21.620> you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the real twirl the one I showed you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.750 
the real twirl the one I showed you
earlier<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.810> only<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:23.959> one<00:02:25.330> turn<00:02:27.280> okay<00:02:28.280> like

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
earlier but only do one turn okay like

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.190 
earlier but only do one turn okay like
this<00:02:29.000> or<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.989> just<00:02:30.650> one<00:02:30.920> half<00:02:31.220> turn<00:02:31.459> up

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
this or like this just one half turn up

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.110 
this or like this just one half turn up
so<00:02:33.200> I'll<00:02:34.040> work<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.340> into<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.610> pattern<00:02:34.790> like

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
so I'll work this into a pattern like

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:48.680 
so I'll work this into a pattern like
this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750 

you
