some<00:00:33.199> of<00:00:33.289> the<00:00:33.350> crucibles<00:00:33.770> it's<00:00:34.010> just

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
some of the crucibles it's just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.430 
some of the crucibles it's just
phenomenal<00:00:34.340> but<00:00:34.850> I<00:00:35.060> played<00:00:35.690> three<00:00:35.960> shots<00:00:36.230> in<00:00:36.380> a

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
phenomenal but I played three shots in a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.140 
phenomenal but I played three shots in a
row<00:00:36.470> which<00:00:36.800> were<00:00:36.950> quite<00:00:37.310> tricky<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.880> at<00:00:38.060> the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
row which were quite tricky and at the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.819 
row which were quite tricky and at the
beginning<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.540> break<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.020> after<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.650> it

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
beginning the break and after that it

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.680 
beginning the break and after that it
was<00:00:39.890> probably<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.420> probably<00:00:41.420> one<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.570> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
was probably the probably one of the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.970 
was probably the probably one of the
quickest<00:00:42.020> I've<00:00:42.170> ever<00:00:42.320> made<00:00:42.500> because<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:42.800> was

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
quickest I've ever made because I was

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.770 
quickest I've ever made because I was
always<00:00:43.100> in<00:00:43.280> position<00:00:43.640> from<00:00:43.850> then<00:00:43.970> on<00:00:44.120> okay

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
always in position from then on okay
