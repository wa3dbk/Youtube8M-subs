00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.239
 on the 9th 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.550
 the right signals what an impossibility 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 unlikely they actually see the most important part of the anti-social set 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 Rangnick the company offers them is incomprehensible 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 I have signals of relaxation 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.270
 by 0 4 percent 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.790
 »Continue St 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.510
 February are used in which Christians by Daniel Foppa 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.680
 directly from which I do not want to hold him admissible holds the Greek 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.650
 Harald v should therefore apply 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.830
 because rather stifled both suffered a concrete tip off 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.810
 There are some that are easy for anyone to beat under the reassurances 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.020
 recognize 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.880
 At this meeting, both dogs slowly walk towards each other 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
 and now the brown bitch starts to turn her eyes away 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.260
 even the black bitch calms down 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.850
 They finally decide to come on the move and run 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.050
 a bow around each other 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.260
 the slow movements are to turn away the look and the samples 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.150
 signal to the opposite that one is careful and the friendlier 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.070
 Intention more 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 and do not want to scare the other one 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.170
 Here the white shepherd dog goes straight to the bitch 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.570
 whereupon she stops very quietly 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.710
 the male goes slowly towards her again and lays down again several times 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.130
 about the catch 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 the bitch stays calm and the dog goes inside 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.220
 slowly around her to report to her because this is too intrusive 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.219
 she goes away 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 to stop that we know from the previous example so far 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.189
 go that a dog completely freezes 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.069
 Here's a hurdle in Simlish proclaiming a Husky half-breed 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.109
 to come 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:18.439
 she does not move at times 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 always freezes almost completely 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:30.859
 as the reprimand she obtrusively approves Schmandt briefly 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.289
 what would be answered 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.829
 that he shows a particularly noticeable appease signal 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 he turns the lateral body game to her 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.900
 He repeats this signal when greeting the arriving dogs 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.699
 No 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.609
 completely natural part of the communication so you will not only 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.239
 shown if they really conflict and should be avoided 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.539
 or already running 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:23.259
 so they could be called courtesy Screven healthy people 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.060
 also use for them 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.390
 It is considered rude to constantly sting your eyes when you look at yourself 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.340
 entertains 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.500
 you shorten the Wittmann you look to the side man nods his head 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.830
 einnickt and as is the connected is prevented, for example, as 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.319
 impossible to achieve very fast and head-on approach it is considered 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.869
 polite in oral communication in Pürgen 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:52.269
 approach and take the pace out of the movement 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.099
 slowed movements signalize they are raised 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.039
 I approach so that you can adjust to it there is none of mine 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.449
 Aggression out 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:05.320
 but 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.820
 What is at least as important to us is the dog owners too 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.540
 schools 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.030
 learn about the appeasement signals that they see 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.370
 when the federal government uses it when it is important that he may use it 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.300
 for example when we think of the scene where 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.490
 Percent of white shepherd dog running on the trail and a man is coming 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.270
 opposite 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.930
 and the dog simply has the need in the 2 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.009
 to dodge above and should be his master, so to speak 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.819
 Splatter end between myself and the approaching persons I would 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.659
 He now lives enough 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.450
 give the command a foot and not allow it 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.460
 may go to the crop body side i would make it practical 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.889
 give a negative information that he is actually polite 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.400
 want to be and soothing or 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.199
 even the need to dodge because he feels insecure 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.439
 but if I lead the leash behind the body 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.889
 Insider I understood what you want then who on this page 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.210
 then conflicts do not even come up 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.000
 so i can actively browse my dog's little things in everyday life 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 help 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.769
 in trade 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.469
 on the 9th 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 on the 9th
