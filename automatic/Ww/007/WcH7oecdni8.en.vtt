 get that mail immediately on mine 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.370
 website and the person wrote 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.259
 What does it look like and has somebody ever? 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 lost 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.710
 make a video about it as it is then 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.550
 has and so on and so on and that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.560
 I thought I'll do a video 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.730
 about that 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 I already lost my person and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
 Although my grandpa of the city ​​very much 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.719
 Near 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.670
 I'm practically 17 years old 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.110
 to Germany 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.210
 after I left germany 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.280
 with three and my parents are in israel 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.090
 remained 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.800
 He was like my father really made me 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.899
 supports 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.039
 surprisingly private too very close and me 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.480
 do not know but always such a connection 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.870
 since he was not the spokesman 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.420
 He did not talk much but you child 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.909
 it certainly sometimes you have such a 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.939
 special connection to one and at 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.460
 that was the case for my grandfather 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.990
 and he eventually had dementia 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.430
 get and yes he has me even 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 no longer recognized or 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.600
 did not know who is ours anymore 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.979
 yes and died from a year 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.170
 and at the beginning it was pretty 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.700
 heavy 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.619
 I have the taken quite emotional 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 and now even my grandma lays in 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 Hospital and I say it that way I come 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.509
 now the old will say the old 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 I die the way they die 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.360
 just that was just life and me 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 meanwhile I have resigned myself to it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020
 and 2 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.340
 the thing so I pretty much see that 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.040
 rational we come here to this world 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.040
 and eventually we will go again 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.400
 that we are not here forever on this 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.930
 planet and we just have to be happy 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.860
 that we are here every one of us 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.810
 exploit moment 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.240
 I do not know who died with you 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.660
 or if you lost but then 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.020
 so now his parents are using every moment 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.300
 off mobile phone go up or down 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.500
 or pharmacy your mum I do not know 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.760
 where she lives and sit down and talk 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.280
 half an hour with him 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.050
 who does that already of you who sits 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.790
 talking to his parents and talking 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.590
 with whom he prefers to do that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.220
 facebook dear mobile phone dear friend 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.500
 league what do I know that makes use of times 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.620
 every moment if you still 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.840
 Grandparents have gone there and drive 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.510
 uses every minute up 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980
 very important 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 and that fills you with one 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.900
 good feeling and then you have that too 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.640
 What we can do is the best 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.349
 from that 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.340
 everything else at the national level is what people see 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.349
 will die 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.569
 that gets the whole area away 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.250
 normal you will someday 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.769
 That's why it just makes that easy 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:29.730
 the best of it 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:31.230
 and this world is just about everything 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.120
 Temporarily everything we have got it 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.480
 Temporarily even our body belongs to us 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.840
 Not 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.560
 that's why i would say life like that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.690
 to watch a game and the best of it 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.159
 play by bringing new people 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.549
