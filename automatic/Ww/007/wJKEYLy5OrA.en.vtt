00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
then you can go back up on the elevator

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
then you can go back up on the elevator
and<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.430> loop<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.810> that's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and get your loop I don't think that's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.899 
and get your loop I don't think that's
the<00:01:34.140> best<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.979> because<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.700> he's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the best way to do it because if he's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
the best way to do it because if he's
out<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.299> open<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.780> his<00:01:36.960> area<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.470> effect<00:01:37.950> damage

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
out to open in his area of effect damage

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
out to open in his area of effect damage
will<00:01:39.030> kick<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.540> ass<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.960> you'll<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.439> to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
up that and it's a little bit of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.070 
up that and it's a little bit of
rhythmic<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.240> watch<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> way<00:02:34.810> I'm<00:02:34.930> doing

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
rhythmic if you watch the way I'm doing

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.720 
rhythmic if you watch the way I'm doing
it<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.500> first<00:02:35.770> started<00:02:36.100> trying<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.430> smash

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
it like I first started trying to smash

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.760 
it like I first started trying to smash
it<00:02:36.970> but<00:02:37.300> if<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.540> keep<00:02:37.990> pushing<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.500> real

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it but if you just keep pushing it real

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.370 
it but if you just keep pushing it real
slow<00:02:39.130> it'll<00:02:39.790> get<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.300> up<00:02:40.480> there<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.230> you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
slow it'll get you up there and then you

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.230 
slow it'll get you up there and then you
can't<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.830> behind<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.310> pillars<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.820> yeah

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
can't get behind the pillars so yeah

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.449 
can't get behind the pillars so yeah
it's<00:02:43.480> best<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.990> keep<00:02:44.260> him<00:02:44.500> stuck<00:02:44.860> behind<00:02:45.070> a

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
it's best to keep him stuck behind a

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.490 
it's best to keep him stuck behind a
pillar<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.330> can<00:02:46.570> blast<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.080> shit<00:02:47.350> out<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
pillar so you can blast the shit out of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.640 
pillar so you can blast the shit out of
him<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.860> not<00:02:48.280> get<00:02:48.550> hit<00:02:48.760> by<00:02:48.910> his<00:02:49.060> AoE<00:02:49.450> attack<00:02:50.050> so

falling back in right now it was about

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.770 
falling back in right now it was about
11:30<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.950> night<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.610> we're<00:03:03.760> not<00:03:03.940> sure<00:03:04.300> if<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
11:30 at night so we're not sure if the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.710 
11:30 at night so we're not sure if the
timer<00:03:05.080> went<00:03:05.470> off<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.190> 24<00:03:06.640> hours<00:03:06.970> or<00:03:07.390> if<00:03:07.600> he

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
timer went off for the 24 hours or if he

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.900 
timer went off for the 24 hours or if he
just<00:03:08.019> randomly<00:03:08.260> spawn<00:03:08.830> back<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.550> tried<00:03:09.820> to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
just randomly spawn back in we tried to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.970 
just randomly spawn back in we tried to
get<00:03:10.030> him<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.180> respawn<00:03:10.660> again<00:03:11.019> but<00:03:11.470> we<00:03:11.620> couldn't

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
get him to respawn again but we couldn't

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.009 
get him to respawn again but we couldn't
so<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.519> think<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.209> was<00:03:13.330> probably<00:03:13.630> because<00:03:13.780> at<00:03:13.959> a

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
so I think it was probably because at a

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.960 
so I think it was probably because at a
timer<00:03:14.290> but<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.220> funny<00:03:15.489> loved<00:03:15.790> that

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
timer but it was just funny loved that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.570 
timer but it was just funny loved that
we<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.209> still<00:03:16.480> down<00:03:16.690> here<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.200> he<00:03:17.530> respawned

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
we are still down here and he respawned

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.490 
we are still down here and he respawned
and<00:03:18.670> then<00:03:19.000> I'd<00:03:19.120> spoil<00:03:19.450> my<00:03:19.630> deathtrap<00:03:20.200> I'm<00:03:20.350> like
