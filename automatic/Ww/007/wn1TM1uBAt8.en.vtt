00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.030
 Y 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.030
 all right 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.820
 good 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.039
 in the previous video I already teach you to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 do an exfoliating for feet in this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.440
 I'm going to teach you how to make a video 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 Exfoliating 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.750
 the hand for a manicure 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.450
 and then different exfoliants because not 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.760
 the skin of the hands is the same as the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.920
 skin of the feet skin of the feet 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.130
 I usually do a little rougher that's why 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.960
 I recommend you use flaxseed 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.800
 but I forgot to mention something in the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 another video that 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.230
 If you do not have flaxseed do not worry 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.829
 it is necessary the sugar already has the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.059
 effect of being an exfoliant then 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.670
 no dance itself but not perfect 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.350
 in this case good on this occasion 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 I'll teach you to make a scrub 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.680
 hands a little more delicate for the same 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.050
 that we're going to start 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.350
 apply sugar 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.340
 here I have approximately 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.659
 5 tablespoons of sugar and so on 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.260
 as in the previous video 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.730
 We are going to use coconut oil 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.100
 very well 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.000
 you use everything 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.000
 what I have left 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.850
 and I will use oil 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.590
 grape the grape oil I know 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.220
 I recommend because apart from having a 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.120
 very very rich aroma and it helps us 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.330
 hydrate a lot what these parts are 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.150
 For example, I have dry weather and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.970
 it helps us a lot in our parts 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.500
 I do not have grape oil and what I 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.700
 I use it's grape farm the appointment is for 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.670
 The hair 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.370
 and it leaves a very nice texture in the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.030
 hair and I is what he uses in this 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.340
 I do not have time grape close I have 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.550
 this good is practically the same 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.950
 but it comes with an atomizer but this 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.560
 is the one that I use the normal line to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.080
 sometimes with some accounts to whom apart 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.050
 When you unclog it or when you apply it, it smells 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.440
 too much now then 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.410
 in this case I will use this 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.620
 let's apply 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.799
 a little bit not much 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.959
 as what is civic is a little more 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 thick this is more liquid for the same 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.580
 of the atomizer if it is thick add a 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.080
 a little more 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.080
 and we are going to stir 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.950
 This exfoliant has to create a 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:17.220
 sandy texture you can hear that it's 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.220
 as in use but it is perfect 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.939
 Y 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.950
 let's apply with a little 9 or what 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.500
 same of the properties of honey that 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.690
 have on our skin but just a little 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.630
 It's not a big deal 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.920
 like what about a super spoon 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.770
 aic honestly is transcendent 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.480
 clarity 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.480
 it is very delicious it is also 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.329
 yes 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 also a very good scrub for 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.299
 the face is only with sugar and that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.300
 take a bit more consistency 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.640
 liquid that 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.560
 and believe me they will have a skin 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.420
 very very very nice the truth 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.490
 I applied it to me 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.410
 I love I love how it is left to me 

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.070
 do not 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.070
 a skin 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.750
 although I still do not feel a little less fried 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.750
 arrive 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.539
 I'm going to apply another bit of honey 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.670
 with another spoonful 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.090
 in my sight 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.090
 if you need 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.510
 a little bit of me 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.960
 this is the consistency that we should 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.960
 get with this combination 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.319
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.989
 remember to subscribe to my channel and 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.949
 comment if you liked that you would like 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:46.350
 see another type of exfoliants and there is a 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:48.620
 great variety with flowers 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.770
 countries with 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.940
 and chocolate 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.449
 there is even one that is with with sand from 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.830
 more sand than that white sand 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:05.409
 there is even a student with that 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.509
 so if you can not give me 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.349
