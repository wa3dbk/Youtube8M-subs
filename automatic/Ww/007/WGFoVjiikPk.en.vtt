00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 Dear friends, Hello! 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.580
 your attention a novelty from the company tank 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.780
 marksman knife 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 and so Alexander two or three words please 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 so the Marx knife is such a 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.100
 traditional tank box in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 traditional lived black color 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.260
 committed to us they put there they lived 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.630
 there is a knife itself and in general, nothing more 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.440
 accordingly, she first talk about 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.570
 blade materials made of steel 150 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.329
 47 well known to all, respectively 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.430
 is provided to you good rice keeps well 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.270
 cutting edge and high corrosion 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 resilience 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.739
 here is the handle material aluminum that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.020
 makes our easy and quite comfortable so 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.530
 what is actually interesting is 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.780
 knives this model of 2014 she is equipped 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
 This is such a very remarkable 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 quite original for me personally 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.240
 new addition mechanism let's 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.630
 let's see how it works accordingly 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 all start again knife flipper pretty 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.189
 peppy flip since there are set 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
 bearings accordingly as his 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.990
 fold the fold duckling fold they here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.570
 this thing up here and it frees 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.790
 the blade that is reminiscent of old 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.920
 Ratchet log how much huh anew and so 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.189
 further something in principle, 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.400
 due skill quite easily this 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 the same is done so let's say the castle 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 she creates one shadow on the heel of the blade 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.869
 what provides us so to speak 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.430
 spring split for such here 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.259
 peculiar that is to pay attention 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.930
 have not yet brought the hand just moving 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.210
 fingers open the knife that of course 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 I see an interesting way out again. 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 this is the first time 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.420
 and so on what we have to face 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.399
 it is biased accordingly 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.430
 the bolts twisted the clip upside down 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.440
 you under the left hand 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.150
 what else on the technical characteristics 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:10.910
 the total length of the knife let's see 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.690
 about 200 8 millimeters something 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.620
 about that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.260
 blade accordingly from this takes 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 8 and 9 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:32.180
 the weight of this toy is one more thing 119 s 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.790
 say penny grants respectively 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.560
 such a knife is positioned as 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.290
 tactics on the official website of the company 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 The bug is quite comfortable in the hand 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 Basically a light and ever rejoicing by Go 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 say all the same honest you comfortable 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.560
 This castle I yes how to say with 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.690
 habits of course not after 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.730
 standard liners even X's 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.770
 like this strange thing to me very much 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.830
 I liked how it opens the portal 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:03.200
 so what is why you asked me 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.549
 waxing smoothed out mean seriously here 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.500
 really open really 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.340
 effectively quite as noble as 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.739
 called class happens in the yard here 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.480
 closing mechanism of course it is unlikely 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.310
 I 'm afraid of one hand right now 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.500
 honestly give yourself a finger 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.209
 so with two hands this is basically 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.160
 do with easy one finger 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.830
 either from this side to whom it is convenient 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.860
 again left-right provides notches 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.850
 on both sides, see what happens to him 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.560
 how would a child whether he confess yes to me 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.750
 interesting very so original 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.650
 the most important option is pretty 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.930
 design and tactful way to say this is what 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.360
 something obzorchik brief knife from 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.549
