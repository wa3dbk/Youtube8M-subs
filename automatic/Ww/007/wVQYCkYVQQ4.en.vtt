wouldn't recommend doing in one-on-one
games<00:00:14.519> too<00:00:14.759> much<00:00:14.940> unless<00:00:15.120> you're<00:00:15.450> just

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
games too much unless you're just

or a really really big map where your
opponent<00:00:22.230> can't<00:00:22.650> find<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.160> say<00:00:23.340> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
played a one-on-one on the canadian map

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.759 
played a one-on-one on the canadian map
it's<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.980> fast<00:00:26.250> mute<00:00:26.670> attack<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.529> with<00:00:28.529> that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it's a fast mute attack and with that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
it's a fast mute attack and with that
you're<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.789> gonna<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.119> many<00:00:30.210> troops<00:00:30.570> early

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you're not gonna have many troops early

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
you're not gonna have many troops early
oftentimes<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:32.009> build<00:00:32.219> any<00:00:32.489> troops

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
oftentimes I don't build any troops

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.630 
oftentimes I don't build any troops
until<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.899> my<00:00:34.110> mute<00:00:34.320> ACEF<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> very

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
until I get my mute ACEF which is very

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.030 
until I get my mute ACEF which is very
late<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.940> game<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.870> um<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.440> use<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
late in the game but um I do use this in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.560 
late in the game but um I do use this in
multiplayer<00:00:38.370> game<00:00:38.730> sometimes<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.270> play<00:00:39.329> with

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
multiplayer game sometimes I play with

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.889 
multiplayer game sometimes I play with
SUV<00:00:39.989> rush<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.500> juvey<00:00:41.040> twos<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> use

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
SUV rush in juvey twos and I like to use

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
SUV rush in juvey twos and I like to use
this<00:00:43.290> build<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.860> we're<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> confined<00:00:44.910> map

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
this build if we're on a confined map

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
this build if we're on a confined map
that<00:00:45.329> doesn't<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.719> expo<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> can't

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that doesn't have an expo so I can't

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.360 
that doesn't have an expo so I can't
macro<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.730> much<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.289> then<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:50.100> actually

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
macro up very much and then I'm actually

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
macro up very much and then I'm actually
gonna<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> double<00:00:51.480> extractor<00:00:52.050> trick<00:00:52.199> right

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
gonna do a double extractor trick right

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.189 
gonna do a double extractor trick right
here<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.010> get<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.250> drones<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.930> just

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
here so I can get more drones I I just

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.630 
here so I can get more drones I I just
like<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> feel<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
like to do this I like the feel of it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.779 
like to do this I like the feel of it
and<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:59.070> nice<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.579> feel<00:00:59.760> like

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and and it's nice because I feel like

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you get more you get more drones out

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.710 
you get more you get more drones out
quicker<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> feel<00:01:04.920> richer<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
quicker and so I feel richer and then I

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
quicker and so I feel richer and then I
build<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.020> Overlord<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.830> what<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> build

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
build my Overlord and so what the build

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.429 
build my Overlord and so what the build
is<00:01:08.790> gonna<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is gonna be is I just gonna get up to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.890 
is gonna be is I just gonna get up to
twelve<00:01:10.860> drones<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> point<00:01:12.600> I'm

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
twelve drones and then at that point I'm

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.359 
twelve drones and then at that point I'm
gonna<00:01:13.020> drop<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.409> extractor<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.250> on

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
gonna drop an extractor and then on

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
gonna drop an extractor and then on
thirteen<00:01:14.820> I'll<00:01:15.090> build<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:16.369> spawning<00:01:17.369> pool<00:01:18.020> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
thirteen I'll build a spawning pool and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.120 
thirteen I'll build a spawning pool and
that<00:01:19.799> works<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.130> pretty<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:22.130> there's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that works out pretty well there's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.630 
that works out pretty well there's
twelve

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
twelve

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.160 
twelve
here's<00:01:24.090> thirteen<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:24.750> I'll<00:01:24.869> save<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
here's thirteen and then I'll save a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
here's thirteen and then I'll save a
first<00:01:25.409> bonding<00:01:25.710> pool<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> timing<00:01:26.880> with

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
first bonding pool and the timing with

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
first bonding pool and the timing with
that<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.360> such<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.990> should<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that is such that I should have a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.819 
that is such that I should have a
hundred<00:01:28.740> gas<00:01:29.329> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> same<00:01:30.750> time<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.710> my

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
hundred gas at the same time that my

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
hundred gas at the same time that my
spawning<00:01:32.130> pool<00:01:32.430> finishes<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.689> when

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
spawning pool finishes and then when

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.289 
spawning pool finishes and then when
that<00:01:34.259> happens<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:35.369> spawning<00:01:35.820> pool<00:01:35.939> finishing

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
that happens the spawning pool finishing

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.380 
that happens the spawning pool finishing
allows<00:01:36.509> me<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.350> detect<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> lair<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.579> then

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
allows me to to detect a lair and then

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.109 
allows me to to detect a lair and then
by<00:01:40.200> having<00:01:40.680> 100<00:01:41.009> gas<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> also<00:01:41.700> type<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
by having 100 gas I can also type the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
by having 100 gas I can also type the
lair<00:01:42.360> immediately<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.200> gonna<00:01:43.350> send<00:01:43.619> some

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
lair immediately so I'm gonna send some

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
lair immediately so I'm gonna send some
of<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.490> drones<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.210> there<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of my drones over there and then just

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.800 
of my drones over there and then just
continue<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.619> build<00:01:46.799> more<00:01:47.009> drones<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
continue to build more drones and so the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.170 
continue to build more drones and so the
the<00:01:49.229> point<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> build<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> balance<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the point of the build is to balance the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.440 
the point of the build is to balance the
amount<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.720> gas<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:54.270> amount

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
amount of gas you have with the amount

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.700 
amount of gas you have with the amount
of<00:01:54.540> minerals<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
of minerals you have so that you can

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.789 
of minerals you have so that you can
tighten<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.549> soon<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.659> possible<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
tighten as soon as as possible so you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
tighten as soon as as possible so you
can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.340> building<00:01:59.700> right<00:01:59.820> now

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
can see this is building right now

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.790 
can see this is building right now
and<00:02:00.480> then<00:02:00.930> I'm<00:02:01.050> just<00:02:01.170> thinking<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.620> you<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
and then I'm just thinking to you to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.560 
and then I'm just thinking to you to
build<00:02:01.950> drones<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.760> I'm<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.120> gonna<00:02:03.330> get<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
build drones and I'm not gonna get a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.570 
build drones and I'm not gonna get a
queen<00:02:03.870> first<00:02:04.230> thing<00:02:04.470> what's<00:02:05.040> gonna<00:02:05.160> happen<00:02:05.460> as

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
queen first thing what's gonna happen as

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.160 
queen first thing what's gonna happen as
soon<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.940> finish<00:02:06.240> my<00:02:06.270> layer<00:02:06.630> type<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.080> I'm

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
soon as I finish my layer type then I'm

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
soon as I finish my layer type then I'm
gonna<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.440> my<00:02:07.560> queen<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.420> Queen's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
gonna get my queen and then the Queen's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
gonna get my queen and then the Queen's
gonna<00:02:09.899> spawn<00:02:10.140> larva<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.460> heavy<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.450> then

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
gonna spawn larva on the heavy and then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.630 
gonna spawn larva on the heavy and then
that's<00:02:14.280> gonna<00:02:14.460> allow<00:02:14.760> me<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.680> quickly<00:02:16.680> get

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that's gonna allow me to quickly get

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
that's gonna allow me to quickly get
those<00:02:18.090> Mutis<00:02:18.480> enemies<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.110> there's<00:02:19.320> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
those Mutis enemies so there's that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.050 
those Mutis enemies so there's that
there's<00:02:20.100> right<00:02:20.370> about<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> hundred<00:02:20.910> gasps

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
there's right about a hundred gasps

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.340 
there's right about a hundred gasps
right<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.600> can<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.900> something<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
right there you can see something that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.280 
right there you can see something that
gets<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.620> tag<00:02:22.830> right<00:02:23.790> after<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.180> finishes<00:02:24.630> now

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
gets a tag right after this finishes now

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.750 
gets a tag right after this finishes now
there's<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:25.680> bit<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.890> variability<00:02:26.400> at

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
there's a little bit of variability at

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
there's a little bit of variability at
this<00:02:26.970> point<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.690> get<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> couple<00:02:28.050> Ling's<00:02:28.380> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
this point I can get a couple Ling's I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
this point I can get a couple Ling's I
could<00:02:28.860> put<00:02:29.070> down<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> spine<00:02:29.550> crawler<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.060> could

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
could put down a spine crawler I could

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.140 
could put down a spine crawler I could
do<00:02:30.660> some<00:02:30.840> things<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.489> but<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.520> am<00:02:32.760> trying

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
do some things like that but I am trying

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.580 
do some things like that but I am trying
to<00:02:33.209> get<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.480> gasps<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.290> even<00:02:34.440> get

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to get that gasps and you can even get

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.290 
to get that gasps and you can even get
the<00:02:34.739> second<00:02:35.130> gas<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> little<00:02:35.580> bit<00:02:35.760> earlier<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the second gas a little bit earlier and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.500 
the second gas a little bit earlier and
then<00:02:37.020> send<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.880> send<00:02:38.880> your<00:02:38.970> drones<00:02:39.239> over

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
then send your send your drones over

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.930 
then send your send your drones over
there<00:02:39.890> keep<00:02:40.890> popping<00:02:41.190> those<00:02:41.310> overlords<00:02:41.850> so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
there keep popping those overlords so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
there keep popping those overlords so
that<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.209> not<00:02:42.300> supply<00:02:42.720> capped<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.709> once

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that you're not supply capped but once

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
that you're not supply capped but once
again<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.820> not<00:02:44.970> as<00:02:45.330> critical<00:02:46.020> because

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
again it's not as critical because

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.840 
again it's not as critical because
you're<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.739> gonna<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:47.070> those<00:02:47.190> early<00:02:47.580> troops

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you're not gonna get those early troops

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.670 
you're not gonna get those early troops
and<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.600> you're<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.840> gonna<00:02:49.020> keep<00:02:49.320> this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and then you're just gonna keep this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.270 
and then you're just gonna keep this
income<00:02:50.160> coming<00:02:50.459> up<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.500> what<00:02:52.500> does<00:02:52.680> happen<00:02:52.920> is

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
income coming up and what does happen is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.780 
income coming up and what does happen is
you're<00:02:54.150> gonna<00:02:54.239> see<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.550> some

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you're gonna see that you have some

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.400 
you're gonna see that you have some
extra<00:02:57.000> minerals<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.570> play<00:02:57.720> around<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.080> and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
extra minerals to play around with and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.920 
extra minerals to play around with and
so<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> can<00:02:59.640> do<00:02:59.820> things<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.180> get<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> spine

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
so you can do things like get a spine

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.449 
so you can do things like get a spine
call<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> turtle<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:03.000> know<00:03:03.090> or<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.340> if

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
call a turtle you know or to see if

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.000 
call a turtle you know or to see if
there's<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.510> player<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.650> could<00:03:07.830> get<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
there's a the player to so I could get a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100 
there's a the player to so I could get a
spine<00:03:08.250> collar<00:03:08.489> or<00:03:08.730> some<00:03:08.940> units<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.750> have

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
spine collar or some units I do have

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.789 
spine collar or some units I do have
flexibility<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:13.470> do<00:03:13.620> want<00:03:13.769> to

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
flexibility there and you do want to

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.110 
flexibility there and you do want to
make<00:03:13.920> sure<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.220> get<00:03:14.340> plenty<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.640> overloads

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
make sure you get plenty of overloads

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.940 
make sure you get plenty of overloads
because<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> goal<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:16.080> an<00:03:16.200> even

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
because the goal is to have an even

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.789 
because the goal is to have an even
amount<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.459> minerals<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.510> gas<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.650> just

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
amount of minerals and gas and so just

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.600 
amount of minerals and gas and so just
pops<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:21.330> 200<00:03:22.049> 200<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.010> can<00:03:23.220> fill<00:03:23.489> my

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
pops I have 200 200 so I can fill my

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.160 
pops I have 200 200 so I can fill my
spider<00:03:23.940> right<00:03:24.209> away<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.840> built<00:03:25.049> my

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
spider right away and then I built my

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.960 
spider right away and then I built my
queen<00:03:25.410> right<00:03:25.560> away<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.489> soon<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:26.790> your

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
queen right away so as soon as your

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.729 
queen right away so as soon as your
layer<00:03:27.090> finishes<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:28.019> build<00:03:28.230> your<00:03:28.350> spider<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
layer finishes you build your spider you

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.009 
layer finishes you build your spider you
build<00:03:28.950> your<00:03:29.070> queen<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.670> then<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:30.870> back

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
build your queen and then you get back

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.660 
build your queen and then you get back
at<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:32.100> keep<00:03:32.280> these<00:03:32.459> things

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
at it and you just keep these things

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.699 
at it and you just keep these things
mining<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.360> your<00:03:33.480> spire<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.870> gonna<00:03:34.049> you

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
mining and then your spire is gonna you

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.710 
mining and then your spire is gonna you
know<00:03:34.799> take<00:03:35.010> forever<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.880> build<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.480> during

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
know take forever to build so during

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.080 
know take forever to build so during
that<00:03:36.750> time<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.200> just<00:03:37.260> continue<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.370> mine<00:03:38.880> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that time you just continue to mine that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.259 
that time you just continue to mine that
fast<00:03:39.360> oh<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.400> exactly<00:03:41.790> what<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.000> wouldn't

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
fast oh this is exactly what I wouldn't

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.660 
fast oh this is exactly what I wouldn't
want<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.450> happen<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:43.190> if<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.400> does<00:03:44.640> happen

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
want to happen but if that does happen

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.050 
want to happen but if that does happen
in<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.360> game<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.870> still<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.709> room<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.820> then

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
in a game you still have room and then

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.900 
in a game you still have room and then
this<00:03:48.209> Queen<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:48.690> soon<00:03:48.840> as<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> Queen<00:03:49.230> pops<00:03:49.910> you

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
this Queen as soon as the Queen pops you

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.210 
this Queen as soon as the Queen pops you
can<00:03:51.060> see<00:03:51.209> my<00:03:51.420> safe<00:03:52.140> over<00:03:52.380> there<00:03:52.440> cuz<00:03:52.709> computers

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
can see my safe over there cuz computers

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.210 
can see my safe over there cuz computers
really<00:03:53.670> bad<00:03:54.260> soon<00:03:55.260> as<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.410> Queen<00:03:55.590> pops<00:03:55.829> I'm

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
really bad soon as the Queen pops I'm

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.440 
really bad soon as the Queen pops I'm
gonna<00:03:56.400> spawn<00:03:56.579> larva<00:03:56.970> with<00:03:57.090> her<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.420> that

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
gonna spawn larva with her and that

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.420 
gonna spawn larva with her and that
spawning<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.260> larva<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.920> built<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> Queen

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
spawning of larva if I built the Queen

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.100 
spawning of larva if I built the Queen
right<00:03:59.579> when<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.850> lair<00:03:59.970> finished<00:04:00.329> should

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
right when the lair finished should

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.580 
right when the lair finished should
coincide<00:04:01.890> roughly<00:04:02.549> with<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
coincide roughly with the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.910 
coincide roughly with the
of<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.310> spire<00:04:04.550> which<00:04:05.480> should<00:04:06.260> also<00:04:06.410> coincide

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
of the spire which should also coincide

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.790 
of the spire which should also coincide
with<00:04:06.950> me<00:04:07.220> having<00:04:07.459> about<00:04:07.760> 500<00:04:08.480> gas<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:09.530> then

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
with me having about 500 gas and then

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.280 
with me having about 500 gas and then
over<00:04:10.550> 500<00:04:10.970> minerals<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.390> can<00:04:11.540> see<00:04:11.660> here's<00:04:12.200> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
over 500 minerals you can see here's the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.550 
over 500 minerals you can see here's the
point<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.620> time<00:04:12.739> where<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.510> can<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.900> can<00:04:15.140> save<00:04:15.380> up

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
point in time where I can I can save up

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.080 
point in time where I can I can save up
and<00:04:15.800> then<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.340> just<00:04:16.579> want<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.760> make<00:04:16.880> sure<00:04:16.910> you

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
and then you just want to make sure you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.569 
and then you just want to make sure you
have<00:04:17.239> all<00:04:17.269> three<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.230> larvae<00:04:18.560> from<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
have all three of the larvae from the

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.729 
have all three of the larvae from the
hatchery<00:04:19.790> out<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:20.840> noticed<00:04:21.500> there's<00:04:21.680> some

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
hatchery out so I noticed there's some

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.350 
hatchery out so I noticed there's some
time<00:04:22.070> before<00:04:22.280> this<00:04:22.430> finishes<00:04:22.850> so<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.240> make

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
time before this finishes so I can make

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.800 
time before this finishes so I can make
another<00:04:23.630> drone<00:04:23.840> with<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:25.300> see<00:04:26.300> there's

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
another drone with that and see there's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.409 
another drone with that and see there's
the<00:04:27.110> larvae<00:04:27.710> all<00:04:27.919> spawned<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.610> here's<00:04:29.240> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
the larvae all spawned and here's the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.990 
the larvae all spawned and here's the
spire<00:04:29.690> just<00:04:30.110> about<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.470> finish<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.580> six

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
spire just about to finish so I have six

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.390 
spire just about to finish so I have six
larvae<00:04:32.330> available<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.500> should<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:33.860> seven

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
larvae available and I should have seven

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.550 
larvae available and I should have seven
in<00:04:34.610> about<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.880> minute<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.240> then<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:36.200> happens

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
in about a minute and then that happens

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.590 
in about a minute and then that happens
I<00:04:36.889> have<00:04:37.310> plenty<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.639> Overlord<00:04:38.030> space<00:04:38.330> because

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
I have plenty of Overlord space because

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.659 
I have plenty of Overlord space because
I've<00:04:38.660> prepared<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.290> then<00:04:39.770> I'm<00:04:40.040> able<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.370> pump

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
I've prepared and then I'm able to pump

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.730 
I've prepared and then I'm able to pump
out<00:04:40.820> five<00:04:41.180> muta<00:04:41.600> lists<00:04:41.840> then<00:04:42.440> if<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.620> know

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
out five muta lists then if you know

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.110 
out five muta lists then if you know
where<00:04:42.860> your<00:04:42.979> opponents<00:04:43.400> base<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.940> set

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
where your opponents base is you set

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.690 
where your opponents base is you set
your<00:04:44.240> waypoint<00:04:44.690> over<00:04:44.930> there<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.550> then<00:04:46.550> you

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
your waypoint over there and then you

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.310 
your waypoint over there and then you
can<00:04:46.790> do<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:46.940> couple<00:04:47.150> things<00:04:47.450> at<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:47.660> point<00:04:47.900> you

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
can do a couple things at this point you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.110 
can do a couple things at this point you
can<00:04:48.500> maybe<00:04:48.680> throw<00:04:49.070> around<00:04:49.190> an<00:04:49.460> expansion<00:04:50.030> you

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
can maybe throw around an expansion you

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.670 
can maybe throw around an expansion you
can<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.389> my<00:04:50.510> income<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.139> going<00:04:51.260> really<00:04:51.440> well<00:04:51.560> I

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
can see my income is going really well I

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.560 
can see my income is going really well I
can<00:04:52.010> continue<00:04:52.280> Bell<00:04:52.580> tones<00:04:52.880> I<00:04:53.150> can<00:04:53.270> build<00:04:53.419> some

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
can continue Bell tones I can build some

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.680 
can continue Bell tones I can build some
more<00:04:53.630> zerglings<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:55.070> can<00:04:55.460> use<00:04:55.639> my<00:04:55.850> next<00:04:56.120> gas<00:04:56.300> for

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
more zerglings I can use my next gas for

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.370 
more zerglings I can use my next gas for
a<00:04:56.900> damage<00:04:57.440> upgrade<00:04:57.800> or<00:04:58.520> something<00:04:59.419> else<00:04:59.600> and

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
a damage upgrade or something else and

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.800 
a damage upgrade or something else and
there's<00:05:01.220> no<00:05:01.370> new<00:05:01.520> doors<00:05:01.760> there's<00:05:02.389> one<00:05:02.630> more

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
there's no new doors there's one more

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.040 
there's no new doors there's one more
coming<00:05:03.050> out<00:05:03.229> in<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.440> second<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.750> then<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.870> can

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
coming out in a second and then I can

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.110 
coming out in a second and then I can
continue<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.530> build<00:05:06.620> more<00:05:06.800> Mutis<00:05:07.190> or<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.550> can

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
continue to build more Mutis or I can

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.050 
continue to build more Mutis or I can
upgrade<00:05:08.360> whatever<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.110> want<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.380> do<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:10.940> do

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
upgrade whatever I want to do but you do

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.659 
upgrade whatever I want to do but you do
want<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.270> continue<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.190> then<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:13.220> do<00:05:13.400> like

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
want to continue that and then I do like

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.340 
want to continue that and then I do like
to<00:05:13.789> expand<00:05:14.150> at<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.390> point<00:05:14.600> because<00:05:15.110> you've

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
to expand at this point because you've

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.800 
to expand at this point because you've
probably<00:05:15.560> had<00:05:15.919> enough<00:05:17.530> enough<00:05:18.530> time<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:19.810> or

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
probably had enough enough time to or

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.700 
probably had enough enough time to or
you'll<00:05:21.110> have<00:05:21.320> enough<00:05:21.530> time<00:05:21.740> after<00:05:21.979> you<00:05:22.070> attack

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.469 

my<00:05:25.669> karate<00:05:25.940> or<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:27.009> give<00:05:28.009> him<00:05:28.130> alive<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:29.090> they

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
my karate or to give him alive and they

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.180 
my karate or to give him alive and they
actually<00:05:29.810> got<00:05:29.930> a<00:05:29.990> spire<00:05:30.440> up<00:05:30.590> relatively

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
actually got a spire up relatively

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.100 
actually got a spire up relatively
quickly<00:05:31.400> tubes<00:05:31.759> and<00:05:32.000> this<00:05:32.090> is<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> in<00:05:32.690> all<00:05:32.900> air

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
quickly tubes and this is a in all air

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.600 
quickly tubes and this is a in all air
mount<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:33.590> of<00:05:33.770> course<00:05:33.919> on<00:05:34.130> this<00:05:34.250> map<00:05:34.460> is

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
mount so of course on this map is

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.999 
mount so of course on this map is
expected<00:05:35.180> but<00:05:35.840> on<00:05:35.930> another<00:05:36.080> map<00:05:36.440> it's<00:05:36.889> not

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
expected but on another map it's not

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.460 
expected but on another map it's not
gonna<00:05:37.310> be<00:05:37.460> nearly<00:05:37.639> as<00:05:37.910> expected<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.750> have<00:05:38.960> this

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
gonna be nearly as expected to have this

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.930 
gonna be nearly as expected to have this
many<00:05:39.680> drones<00:05:39.889> and<00:05:40.130> yes<00:05:40.250> it's<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.580> very<00:05:40.610> easy

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
many drones and yes it's a very easy

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.300 
many drones and yes it's a very easy
computer<00:05:41.479> but<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.169> goal<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.380> that<00:05:42.770> you<00:05:42.919> play

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
computer but the goal is that you play

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.779 
computer but the goal is that you play
with<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:44.479> strategy<00:05:45.160> against<00:05:47.050> against<00:05:48.050> a

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
with this strategy against against a

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.550 
with this strategy against against a
player<00:05:49.789> on<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.090> normal<00:05:50.330> ground<00:05:50.720> map<00:05:50.930> and

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
player on a normal ground map and

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.070 
player on a normal ground map and
there's<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:51.949> B<00:05:52.070> game<00:05:52.280> from<00:05:52.460> their<00:05:52.639> computer

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
there's the B game from their computer

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.529 
there's the B game from their computer
so<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.440> hope<00:05:54.979> everyone<00:05:55.340> gets<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:56.120> build<00:05:56.330> over

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
so I hope everyone gets that build over

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.870 
so I hope everyone gets that build over
pretty<00:05:56.750> well<00:05:56.840> what<00:05:57.440> its<00:05:57.590> gonna<00:05:57.650> be<00:05:57.889> is<00:05:57.919> gas<00:05:58.610> on

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
pretty well what its gonna be is gas on

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.760 
pretty well what its gonna be is gas on
12<00:05:59.470> spawning<00:06:00.470> pool<00:06:00.770> on<00:06:00.919> 13<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.580> then<00:06:02.509> you<00:06:03.440> put

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
12 spawning pool on 13 and then you put

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.439 
12 spawning pool on 13 and then you put
three<00:06:04.039> drones<00:06:04.580> on<00:06:04.729> gas<00:06:04.940> as<00:06:05.150> soon<00:06:05.300> as<00:06:05.360> that

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
three drones on gas as soon as that

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:06.820 
three drones on gas as soon as that
finishes<00:06:05.840> you<00:06:05.990> should<00:06:06.169> have<00:06:06.320> a<00:06:06.349> hundred<00:06:06.680> gas

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
finishes you should have a hundred gas

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.210 
finishes you should have a hundred gas
at<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.699> same<00:06:07.729> time<00:06:08.240> that<00:06:09.020> you're<00:06:09.380> spawning

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
at the same time that you're spawning

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.879 
at the same time that you're spawning
pool<00:06:10.520> finishes<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.410> then<00:06:12.410> you<00:06:12.500> upgrade

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
pool finishes and then you upgrade

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.400 
pool finishes and then you upgrade
immediately<00:06:13.340> to<00:06:13.520> a<00:06:13.789> layer<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.300> then<00:06:15.169> once

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
immediately to a layer and then once

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.200 
immediately to a layer and then once
your<00:06:15.560> layer<00:06:15.740> finishes<00:06:16.280> and<00:06:16.639> you<00:06:16.849> need<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.090> get

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
your layer finishes and you need to get

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.870 
your layer finishes and you need to get
another<00:06:17.449> extractor<00:06:18.550> probably<00:06:19.550> at<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.699> time

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
another extractor probably at the time

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.189 
another extractor probably at the time
you<00:06:20.030> decide<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.419> upgrade<00:06:20.570> or<00:06:20.840> right<00:06:21.020> before

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
you decide to upgrade or right before

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.200 
you decide to upgrade or right before
after<00:06:22.009> your<00:06:22.250> layer<00:06:22.370> finishes<00:06:22.789> you<00:06:22.940> drop<00:06:23.180> a

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
after your layer finishes you drop a

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.760 
after your layer finishes you drop a
spire<00:06:23.509> and<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.720> build<00:06:23.900> a<00:06:23.990> queen<00:06:24.229> immediately

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
spire and you build a queen immediately

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.409 
spire and you build a queen immediately
when<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.610> Queen<00:06:25.789> comes<00:06:25.970> out<00:06:26.090> you<00:06:26.180> spawn

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
when the Queen comes out you spawn

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.360 
when the Queen comes out you spawn
larvae<00:06:26.780> continue<00:06:27.500> to<00:06:27.620> build<00:06:27.740> overlord<00:06:28.190> so<00:06:28.310> you

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
larvae continue to build overlord so you

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.260 
larvae continue to build overlord so you
have<00:06:28.460> plenty<00:06:28.639> of<00:06:28.820> supply<00:06:29.120> room<00:06:29.349> and<00:06:30.349> then<00:06:30.650> and

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
have plenty of supply room and then and

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.180 
have plenty of supply room and then and
then<00:06:32.270> when<00:06:32.419> you're<00:06:32.630> when<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.620> when<00:06:34.070> your

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
then when you're when you when your

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.860 
then when you're when you when your
spire<00:06:34.580> finally<00:06:35.030> pops<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.389> should<00:06:35.570> be<00:06:35.659> able<00:06:35.750> to

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
spire finally pops you should be able to

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.750 
spire finally pops you should be able to
immediately<00:06:36.349> get<00:06:36.530> five<00:06:36.800> muta<00:06:37.130> lists<00:06:37.310> and<00:06:37.669> then

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
immediately get five muta lists and then

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.129 
immediately get five muta lists and then
bring<00:06:37.940> them<00:06:38.060> over<00:06:38.150> your<00:06:38.360> opponent's<00:06:38.750> base<00:06:38.870> and

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
bring them over your opponent's base and

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.810 
bring them over your opponent's base and
that's<00:06:39.500> really<00:06:39.949> early<00:06:39.979> it<00:06:40.400> should<00:06:40.580> be<00:06:40.669> around

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
that's really early it should be around

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.439 
that's really early it should be around
the<00:06:41.000> five-minute<00:06:41.539> mark<00:06:41.599> six<00:06:41.930> minute<00:06:42.169> mark<00:06:42.349> and

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
the five-minute mark six minute mark and

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.470 
the five-minute mark six minute mark and
six<00:06:44.449> or<00:06:44.599> seven<00:06:44.840> minutes

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
six or seven minutes

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.350 
six or seven minutes
there<00:06:45.690> and<00:06:46.020> so<00:06:46.890> at<00:06:46.980> that<00:06:47.100> point<00:06:47.310> in<00:06:47.430> the<00:06:47.520> game

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
there and so at that point in the game

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.570 
there and so at that point in the game
you're<00:06:48.840> definitely<00:06:49.800> good<00:06:49.950> to<00:06:50.040> harass<00:06:50.310> them

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
you're definitely good to harass them

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.630 
you're definitely good to harass them
and<00:06:50.790> then<00:06:51.300> most<00:06:51.870> of<00:06:52.020> them<00:06:52.170> the<00:06:52.830> players<00:06:53.280> in

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
and then most of them the players in

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.640 
and then most of them the players in
those<00:06:54.000> matches<00:06:54.240> will<00:06:54.540> have<00:06:54.690> to<00:06:54.810> pull<00:06:55.050> back<00:06:55.230> to

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
those matches will have to pull back to

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.230 
those matches will have to pull back to
say<00:06:56.040> this<00:06:56.160> is<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.340> three<00:06:56.550> on<00:06:56.640> three<00:06:56.760> or<00:06:56.970> two<00:06:57.120> on

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
say this is a three on three or two on

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.450 
say this is a three on three or two on
two<00:06:57.420> and<00:06:57.720> then<00:06:58.140> it<00:06:58.260> allows<00:06:58.410> you<00:06:59.070> the

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
two and then it allows you the

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.450 
two and then it allows you the
opportunity<00:07:00.060> to<00:07:00.120> expand<00:07:00.750> or<00:07:01.380> to<00:07:01.710> attack

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
opportunity to expand or to attack
