00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.059
 good morning today by car audio moon 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.290
 present another installation 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.719
 interesting as regards i 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.779
 products and we are just talking about a 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.840
 opening roof of the holland 300 series 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.140
 let's say the deluxe series is the most beautiful 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.140
 so 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.200
 of the 300 series this is the model 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.529
 medium so let's say a roof for 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.770
 medium-sized cars here we are 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:41.590
 speaking of a BMW 3 and 91 series this is it 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 the penultimate machine model yet 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.870
 however a very current machine and for 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.019
 have something more for what 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.580
 concerns the aesthetics and air exchange at the 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.940
 customer asked us for this job 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.210
 particular and today I present it to you here is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.760
 the roof in the semi-open version 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.370
 so with a good air exchange for 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.229
 the gear without giving brightness in 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.490
 aerodynamics can you can hold 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 quietly open also in 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.700
 highway 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.500
 this is the vision from within 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.630
 at this moment the curtain is 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.030
 completely closed and finishing is 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.159
 the same color as the passenger compartment 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.119
 as you can see the thread perfectly 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.509
 in all here we have the console of 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.369
 command with the two memory buttons 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 which can be stored as yes 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.920
 want more manual buttons and that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.920
 of closing 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 then let's see a little bit this is the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.720
 then when there is a lot of sunshine 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 can keep closed 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.140
 otherwise in everyday use one can 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.860
 open quietly ventilate 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.070
 however, and air-transparent fabric 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.799
 so even when closed it allows one 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.830
 good spilling of stale air 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.690
 these are the manual buttons that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.320
 allow you to adjust the roof in the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.660
 position where one believes best 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.000
 these instead are the two buttons of 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.340
 we have the first automatic memory 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.920
 memorized so that it remains seeds 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.950
 open and the second in total opening 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.330
 opening as you see very fast 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.050
 let's return to see how aesthetically 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.050
 outside 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.370
 this is an anti-turbulence spoiler 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.739
 very effective at high speed 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.560
 the aesthetics of the machine clearly is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.450
 improved over the course 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.670
 summer usability in mid-season 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.670
 in winter when one smokes and so on 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.739
 this type of roof has a function 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.459
 Very convenient automatic when 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.310
 which closes the key of the picture him 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.019
 automatically goes to the position of 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.549
 closing so that if by chance it should 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.799
 rain while the car is 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.810
 parked or you forgot to 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.879
 closing the terror in the text closes 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.420
 automatically of course it is possible 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.959
 then you have to leave anyway 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.129
 open the roof even when the car is off 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.129
 now for example I open it 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.859
 I turn off the key to the picture he should 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.650
 closing up as long as I press a button 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.959
 whatever block the roof and here is me 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.799
 I can close the car with the roof 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.109
 open maybe when I'm near the 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.049
 beach by the sea or in any case 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.670
 immediate vicinity of the car e 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.109
 so no risks it starts to rain 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.590
 here is still a small shot of the 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.590
 work 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.600
 so it is seen from below 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.300
 I would say that as a result as not 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.670
 be an original roof on this 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.290
 so the car category is not a 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.770
 those sliding in sheet metal 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.560
 however, within the sky it is 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.790
 aesthetically valid and above all 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.090
 from the outside I sincerely 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.970
 I prefer to those in sheet because it gives 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.180
 a touch of sportiness to the car what that 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.180
 not bad 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.250
 moreover, it is a product that is installed 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.590
 in the day is a product approved the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.590
 price on a car of this kind 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.240
 it is around one thousand euros 1,100 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.690
 according to the difficulties that occur 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.190
 they meet turnkey for which it is 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.990
 Also a figure all things considered low for 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.240
 regarding a result of this 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.560
 gender 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.060
 however, any information in one
