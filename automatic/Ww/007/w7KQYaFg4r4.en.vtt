00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 the best cuisine nyon cuisine 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.030
 very good morning welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.030
 of yolo and his successes Mr. Barcelata 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.059
 today taught to prepare something 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.070
 very rich that you will love the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.830
 Children who do not eat meat are going to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 fascinate and those who eat meat also 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 it's going to sound like we 're going to make it 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.769
 We are going to forgive some pancakes 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 cauliflower with potatoes and sunflower seeds 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 very natural very rich ingredients 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
 they are happening to pass down the screen 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.130
 so what happened and the ingredients or I 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.469
 that he wanted to say the loop with which 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.570
 sebastiÃ¡n and they were very tranquilitos and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.340
 serene that were relaxed is that the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 safe loop was from others the diets 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.700
 as a child the mother pinches her parts every 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.700
 quietecito are 1 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:06.160
 the clock sang the mornings not the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:11.330
 help we have at home 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.770
 and you are already teaching me valentino sir 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.720
 barcelata then already told that the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.000
 main product of these pancakes are 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.090
 cauliflower Politur which give 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.189
 cooking either in water to boil it or 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.960
 if you decide to steam them 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.450
 I recommend that you use 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 grate which should not touch the water 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
 because then the position is no longer 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.780
 general goes with there has to be a cap 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 so that that steam chamber is generated and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.460
 approximately it is cooking 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.810
 steam about 12 minutes approximately 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.090
 starting from the steam starts to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.009
 be generated and the cauliflower is ready 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 you have to make a puree in a processor 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.360
 that is perfectly moneo not what 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.100
 I can do with a gadget is that they are 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.119
 to make mashed potatoes because it's a 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.890
 bit harder 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.119
 then the processor took me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.890
 Once it's in the processor, it's 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.050
 brought this for the lady treats and what's 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.270
 to combine with mashed potatoes has 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.890
 put half a cup of mashed potatoes on 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
 mashed potatoes what will help me in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.429
 this preparation is the same to paste 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.110
 all the ingredients because if I 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.610
 pancakes formed around the one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.050
 yes yes, please go there 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.030
 combining with this shovel to make it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.100
 easier if I did nothing more than 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.470
 cauliflower and cauliflower there is no way to 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.150
 they join and then even though I stick 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.680
 to egg and although you'll like the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.420
 resolution of teeth that sometimes one in 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 others did not help him form 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.350
 perfectly the pancakes that is the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 mission of the potato and it's half a thing that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.040
 they approximate being a small box well 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.280
 cooked pureed and of course in the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.680
 cooking that takes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.110
 I start to help season then jo 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.269
 we are going to add two tablespoons is very 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.400
 just two tablespoons savor finely 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.959
 chopped as they are some pancakes I do not want 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.120
 feel the large pieces of the onion 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:54.530
 that is chiquitita then it is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.530
 I added that it would provide humidity 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.209
 we add sunflower seed 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.850
 especially in the salads after I go 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.590
 to add parmesan sir how rich is 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.690
 is putting this and then I'm going to 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.180
 add a glue that in this case 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.400
 it would be an egg yolk more egg not 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.140
 because then it makes me very wet 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.570
 preparation that's why it's a retiring the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.670
 clear and I'm just adding the yolk 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.220
 then I add the yolk sir 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.990
 barcelona and this is the time to 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.360
 start to subtract moisture to be able to 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.370
 well form the pancake then added 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.879
 ground bread 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.430
 and I'm also going to add flour and shoulders 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.110
 or new if you spend them soft and stuff 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.390
 being perfectly until this 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.569
 feel that the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.849
 compact homogeneous mass to form some 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.260
 pancakes with you have to season with salt and 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.209
 with pepper of course and in what 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.560
 you achieve that I go to the blender 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.870
 to make a caldillo that is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.720
 very simple but that I give two successes 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 very easy to make the difference 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.909
 in that tomato sauce I have then 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.440
 6 tomatoes that have been boiled until 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.860
 that burst like this 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:14.610
 add garlic 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:17.430
 onion taxis I will add half 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.239
 cinnamon stick that will be a little piece 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.459
 like this one 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.290
 lara and branches branches I had to see 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.360
 cinnamon sticks that are so high 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.790
 in xochimilco I saw some branches like that 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.550
 tall of cinnamon calculated a piece 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.920
 teeny we are going to add a nail I 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.380
 I have them ground because I am very young 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.540
 for support for flaws of inventing 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.890
 to grind the garlic the cloves in a 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.710
 little machine that I have but if you do not 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.810
 it has how to grind nails nails 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.260
 smell put the whole whole brace goes 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 to grind here 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.930
 it came out sport that I'm not aggravating more 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.250
 that something is all I have is the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.230
 humidity of tomatoes which is what 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.000
 will help you grind if in the case that 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.000
 I do not want to grind the blender add 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.080
 as I already have it 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.210
 sorry 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:21.610
 and the children are around to add 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.210
 then to fry this sauce that I just 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.460
 to make a teaspoon of oil alone 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.479
 it's a little bit, there's no need to abuse 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.820
 to strain this preparation then added 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:42.350
 all this that I just ate here 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:43.820
 and for another lady now if the lady 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.300
 So now let's put some 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.720
 oil in the pan just covering all 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.160
 the surface of the poster 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.930
 with this because I like to do it 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.210
 with spoons for ice cream because 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.610
 this way I do all the portions of the 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.960
 same size please do take a 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.910
 portion with the spoon and make a 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.860
 pancake with my hands while I'm 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.210
 flying the sauce that I just grind 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.490
 perfectly strained and there I am going to 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.749
 let it start frying this about 5 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.089
 minutes after five minutes 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:14.610
 then I will add the broth that are 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:18.719
 two cups of broth uyuyuy ale jumps now 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.379
 two cups of chicken broth wants it 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:25.879
 circular or as flying American football 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:28.800
 I do not want it to circulate sir they are pancakes 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:30.949
 now he knows he has the right to pass it 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:39.959
 for still a little more in a pancake 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:42.419
 good look at the strength of the reformita 

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:46.259
 base the other time for good you at home 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:48.809
 pass it through the ground bread to help it 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.639
 that resists more frying and puts it in 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:52.589
 the pan until golden cold that 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.509
 get a golden tone perfectly by 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:57.330
 both sides if you want to make it in oven 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.949
 you can also do 180 degrees in one 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.469
 pan sprinkle it with a little 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:04.530
 oil and it will leave about 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:07.220
 about 20 minutes 25 in the oven 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:13.160
 do not want to fry 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:15.740
 but as in this sauce I can add 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.480
 the chicken broth and returns it to 45 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.780
 points at the end rectified seasoning with salt 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.420
 and with pepper lord please high him 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.030
 we can give an 8 pebble because the 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.980
 the best seasoning is that of the mind and for 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.580
 give that area to the heart there goes the 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.640
 Quote of the day to pick your battles well 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.880
 Sometimes it is better to have peace than to have the 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.880
 reason
