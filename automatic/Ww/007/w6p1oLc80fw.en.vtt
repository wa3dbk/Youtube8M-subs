00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.150
 successful 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.710
 because of those successes in the early 1980s nintendo made plans 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.800
 to launch a home console based on a system of cartridges 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.120
 masayuki uemura designed the system in what was his first console for the

 better known as 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.779
 fame as the first year was not good 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.980
 since the system was unlikely 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.049
 had software errors repeat day to hang 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.779
 the new units incorporated better motherboards that the panic took off 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:34.969
 and it became the most sold console in Japan in 1984 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.409
 Encouraged by success 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.409
 Nintendo put its eyes on the North American market

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.139
 in the united states the console was as popular as in japan 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:11.069
 super mario bros was one of the titles released for sale in the same pack 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.649
 next to the console for the launch to the North American market of the console

 nintendo entered into negotiations with atari to launch the fam and camber or the 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.649
 atari reputation as the name of nintendo enhanced video system 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.849
 this deal finally failed 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.919
 the consequent plans to bring to market the fam and with in North America 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.129
 with a keyboard a unit of cáceres

 of a special cartridge the basic under the name of nintendo advanced videos 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.439
 extreme also never materialized 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.919
 finally in June of 1985 nintendo unveiled its American version of the fam 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.930

 in europe and australia 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.859
 the system was launched as two sea areas that are separated 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.780
 the distribution in region b 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.870
 it consisted of most of the European continent 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.379
 excluding italy 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.369
 was handled by a number of different companies with the 

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:23.779
 nintendo's responsibility for most of the releases of the 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:24.559
 cartridges 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:29.439
 the launch in most countries of region b was in 1986 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.659
 more than managing the distribution in the region to 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.409
 which consisted of the united kingdom 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.509

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.360
 beginning the following year 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.960
 Until 1990 Nintendo did not take over the distribution in the newly created 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.740
 European dominance despite the lackluster presentation of the system outside of 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.100
 Japan and North America in 1990 the table had become the best console 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.840

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.050
 United 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.150
 but he faced a very tough competition due to the situation practically 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.279
 monopoly exercised by Nintendo in the United States 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.689
 however in europe the cea master system dominated in the competition was 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:15.699
 more balanced 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.280
 which motivated nintendo to make licenses for sega master games 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.039
 system for your console 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.509
 for the rest of the decade 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.319
 nintendo won the first place in disputed sales in the United States and 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.379
 Japan in the company became the most successful corporation in the 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.810
 Eastern nation at the dawn of the 1990s 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.249
 at the same time that the decade of the nineties dawned a renewed competition 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.360
 technological by superior system 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.319
 like for example place ameal brahím known as genesis in 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.370
 16-bit North America 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.539
 marked the end of the domain of the nes 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.169
 eclipsed by the super nintendo entertainment system console or little motivates in 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.069
 its initials as 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.330
 also from nintendo 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.349
 the user base of the table and gradually grew 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.629
 nintendo continued to support the system in america during the first half of 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.900
 the decade even released a new version of the console 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.780
 lán is 2 that fixed many of the design flaws in the charge the 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.939
 lan is original 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.840
 in 1995 as a consequence of the decrease in sales and lack 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.110
 of new games 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.199
 nintendo de america officially suspended the table 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.729
 even though the developers of the anesthetized their production 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.410
 a number of high-level franchises and game rooms for the nes 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.860
 they were ported to the new consoles that retain their popularity today 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.560
 Nintendo's own company games like super mario bros 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.750
 the legend of zelda 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.520
 in detroit 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.240
 which debuted on the table 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.840
 and capcom games like the mega man saga 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.860
 of konami lassad from castlevania 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.180
 in the franchises after dennis final fantasy bra bank is 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.870
 during the years after the official death télam is in the West it 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.930
 formed a collectors' market around street markets 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.229
 neighborhoods and trails leading some players to rediscover the andés 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.139
 coupled with the growth of console emulation 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.310
 the end of the 90s 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.089
 suppose a second golden age for the nes 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:13.859
 the second-hand market began to decline after the year 2000 against 

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:16.859
 robberies did not return to suppose before to cold that was in the past 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.229
 In parallel to the rise in interest in emulation, the mobile 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.830
 dedicated to this console 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.509
 the monk fans 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:28.699
 performed tasks such as the test launch the table a new housing 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.719
 for the first sectioning of its parts just for fun 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:35.360
 the controllers are particularly susceptible to modify 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.439
 often they are adapted to be able to contact them to a personal computer 

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.719
 through a parallel port or st 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:45.800
 some modding fans of the table have transformed their console into a 

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.809
 portable game console adding the novelty batteries of a led diode with a 

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:51.169
 LCD screen 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.680
 in 1996 the console stopped being officially produced 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.340
 but his fans still today remain faithful to nintendo that his novelties 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.630
 products
