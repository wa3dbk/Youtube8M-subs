gaming<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:20.240> bizarre<00:00:21.439> but<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.619> also

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
gaming which is bizarre but it's also

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.880 
gaming which is bizarre but it's also
kind<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> funny<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:24.080> his<00:00:25.080> reasoning<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
kind of funny because his reasoning is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
kind of funny because his reasoning is
pretty<00:00:26.400> much<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.849> same<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.330> parasites<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
pretty much the same as parasites and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.890 
pretty much the same as parasites and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that leaving his former team wasn't a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.430 
that leaving his former team wasn't a
very<00:00:40.559> good<00:00:40.710> idea<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.690> optic<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.899> wasn't<00:00:43.230> his

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
very good idea and optic just wasn't his

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
very good idea and optic just wasn't his
home<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.149> it's<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> same<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:45.539> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
home and it's the same thing that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.840 
home and it's the same thing that
parasite<00:00:46.469> said<00:00:46.710> its<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> width<00:00:47.460> bridge

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
parasite said its kind of width bridge

really weird because I if you think
about<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.860> mean<00:00:53.010> joining<00:00:53.399> joining<00:00:53.579> optic<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
about it I mean joining joining optic is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
about it I mean joining joining optic is
it's<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> business<00:00:56.910> decision<00:00:57.420> at

it's it's more of a business decision at
this<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.620> become<00:00:58.949> really

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
this point and you can become really

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.540

kind of good because you see a lot of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.999 
kind of good because you see a lot of
people<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:15.570> joining<00:01:16.080> teams<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.860> they

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.090 
money but you have people joining teams
because<00:01:21.979> they<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> win<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:25.020> know

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
for people like Saints and parasite

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080 
for people like Saints and parasite
that's<00:01:28.140> obviously<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.430> important<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> them

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that's obviously more important to them

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.319 
that's obviously more important to them
than<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:31.670> gigantic<00:01:32.670> paycheck<00:01:33.320> which<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:35.329> it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
strange because you don't play a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.730 
strange because you don't play a
