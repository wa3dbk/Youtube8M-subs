 when sports generally what at other banks than the citizens I want 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.869
 Everything wonderful, we fall to her aunt Anna Kemper 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.280
 the compact games including the track can overlook 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.080
 and then he works in the fields we keep working a bit 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.030
 but he was at all events were also Alonso was after a half 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.810
 hour 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.090
 Furthermore 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.710
 be around 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.969
 Passengers would

 another why percent he even calls for expanding and middle east as well 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.390
 bury several shops and houses underneath I understand the world 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.390
 not really I would not be more familiar 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420
 maybe not on two or three wheels 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.600
 but even on four wheels there can still do something or 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.600
 4 Abs they were in the state calendar for the first time last weekend 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.360
 Find 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.580
 In the Cup Blättler took the former Folio enjoyment ca 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.890
 a strong driver field among the well over 2000 motorsport fans at this 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.440
 Weekend offered in the solo and sidecar class 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.180
 exciting duels 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the international scene 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.600
 the fascinated defense 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 the four runs to the final 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.910
 Points were collected diligently 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.700
 Last year's winner knows injured by the MSC Melsungen sat here with 17 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 Points in front of the newly crowned European champion 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.969
 percentage 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.990
 with 15 points through 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.219
 for local hero Andre Tauber 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.699
 a lot of things this weekend not so tingling 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.369
 but not surprising 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.769
 after a six-month injury break because he's at this 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.819
 Weekend the topic is back at the start 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.949
 Unfortunately, he only scored two points in his class next year 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.949
 that will certainly be more points again 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.169
 shortly after 4 pm on Sunday 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.109
 that's usually the time the finals 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.639
 that was also the fiftieth international 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.219
 ADAC grass track race in Melsungen so 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.769
 on points it could not be otherwise see them from Mykonos and Stefan 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.149
 Brandhofer were equal with 17 points 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.399
 and then the state 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:49.939
 Tommy Kunert is at the top, he can hold this to the end 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.079
 he the winner 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.909
 but then what happens in this sport can happen to more 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.609
 Racing accident in the first round 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.180
 Markus Brandhofer with co-driver Choriner Günther he wished Schwier 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.969
 while passenger artist with nosebleeds gets away Markus became 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.089
 Brandhofer drove to the hospital the innocent collarbone fracture 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.839
 unfortunately that was the last relation on this weekend dark clouds on 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.469
 Heaven they opened their doors 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.949
 and thus the finals could not be driven anymore 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.879
 Stefan Brandhofer was the winner of the sidecar class 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.249
 He had exactly as many points with Tommy Kunert 17 in number but he 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.179
 had the better placements out 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:39.459
 although he looked and this time unfortunately from 4 what once again an eventful 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.579

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.010
 the motorsport fans from all over Europe 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.879
 were definitely excited about the fiftieth international ADAC 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.379
 Grass track race in Melsungen
