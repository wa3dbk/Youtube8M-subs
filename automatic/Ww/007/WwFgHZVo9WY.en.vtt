00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.910
 i 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 I think the exchange can bring me 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.560
 much in the personal field since it will be 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.750
 the definitive independence that starts 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
 in the first course new country people 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.090
 different and discover other methods of 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 work 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.510
 the great opportunity is represented now 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.160
 to be able to work and live with 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.440
 people from different countries and from 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.270
 different cultures I know that all this I'm going 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.860
 to get great friends but what more 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.390
 I want to be able to pose things 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.870
 that until now I had not even had 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.870
 occurred 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.030
 I think this professionally 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.370
 experience can bring me a lot 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.560
 because here you can acquire many 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.870
 knowledge but what better to go 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.610
 outside really and know how the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.190
 world itself then from my point of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.480
 view of that experience can give me 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.550
 very much and can give me a lot 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.550
 from faces to a more open labor world 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 in the first exchange you go much more 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.880
 lost to the situation you do not know the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 country does not know the times 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.470
 that happening stay instead in a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.150
 exchange you're there and you already have a 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.830
 different context that is everything you know 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.149
 what are you going to enjoy you know that you are going to 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.890
 learn you have to squeeze the most 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.300
 the situation that you have been having there 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.040
 you're not afraid to talk to people 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.410
 present to sell yourself even 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.960
 organize your same trip because you already know 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.400
 how is it going you know how different you are 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.130
 in a country that is not yours but good 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.350
 I enjoy it now and it's already not happening 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.690
 never all seeing all exchanges 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.330
 both two on the Asian continent yes 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.010
 that has made me realize that there is more 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.690
 I work outside of Spain that sometimes 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 within Spain the forms of work 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.480
 in those places because although sometimes they are 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.190
 different than Spain yes that to us 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.650
 as people who have already been the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.400
 foreign and we have seen another world then 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.400
 they are attractive 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.620
 for me one of the most important things 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.900
 and the ones I learned the most when I went 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.180
 through the change has been the ability 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.409
 to be able to relate to other people 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.150
 the truth is that it is very 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.489
 enriching to meet people of the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 five continents and everything you can 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.329
 learn from those people and it will also be 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.340
 that at the end of the second exchange 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.290
 you realize the network of friends that 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.290
 you have done in the whole world
