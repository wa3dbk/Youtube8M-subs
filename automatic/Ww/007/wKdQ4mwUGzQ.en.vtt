00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
while but blow in it it's spring-loaded

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.899 
while but blow in it it's spring-loaded
here<00:00:47.129> let<00:00:47.250> me<00:00:47.280> show<00:00:47.339> you<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.699> spring-loaded

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
here let me show you it's spring-loaded

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.110 
here let me show you it's spring-loaded
but<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> problem<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.610> having<00:00:50.640> though

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

but it is the problem I'm having though
is<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:52.379> bottom<00:00:52.739> part<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:55.250> it<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
is the bottom part here it kind of

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.310 
is the bottom part here it kind of
sticks<00:00:56.790> up<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.659> hit<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.900> bottom<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
sticks up to hit the bottom of the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.969 
sticks up to hit the bottom of the
battery<00:00:59.059> it's<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.839> just<00:01:01.110> bring<00:01:01.290> loaded<00:01:01.500> or

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
battery it's not just bring loaded or

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.340 
battery it's not just bring loaded or
has<00:01:02.159> any<00:01:02.339> type<00:01:02.549> of<00:01:02.699> cushion<00:01:02.909> whatsoever<00:01:03.570> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
has any type of cushion whatsoever so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.469 
has any type of cushion whatsoever so
when<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> put<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> battery<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.090> very

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
when you put this battery with this very

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.810 
when you put this battery with this very
soft<00:01:06.780> bottom<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.810> falls<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
soft bottom on there and it falls in a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
soft bottom on there and it falls in a
decent<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.690> your<00:01:13.260> batteries<00:01:13.710> are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
decent way like this your batteries are

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.999 
decent way like this your batteries are
gonna<00:01:14.009> start<00:01:14.250> looking<00:01:14.789> like<00:01:18.500> indented<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
gonna start looking like indented so I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.459 
gonna start looking like indented so I
had<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.180> few<00:01:24.210> times<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:25.320> I've

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
had to do this a few times because I've

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.550 
had to do this a few times because I've
lost<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.240> that's<00:01:27.240> gotten<00:01:27.750> worse<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.259> whatever

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
lost and that's gotten worse or whatever

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.730 
lost and that's gotten worse or whatever
it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.250> these<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.289> anything

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it is I make these just out of anything

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.560 
it is I make these just out of anything
that<00:01:31.890> conducts<00:01:32.070> electricity<00:01:32.609> they're<00:01:33.390> just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that conducts electricity they're just

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.170 
that conducts electricity they're just
little<00:01:33.719> metal<00:01:34.020> things<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> find<00:01:34.619> around<00:01:35.180> like

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
little metal things you find around like

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.109 
little metal things you find around like
this<00:01:36.359> is<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.829> welding<00:01:37.829> where<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:38.700> newest<00:01:38.969> one

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this is a welding where is my newest one

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
this is a welding where is my newest one
I<00:01:39.149> made<00:01:39.359> just<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.899> but<00:01:40.740> I've<00:01:40.859> used<00:01:41.070> anything

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I made just now but I've used anything

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
I made just now but I've used anything
from<00:01:42.020> safety<00:01:43.020> pins<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> washers<00:01:44.789> I<00:01:45.359> don't

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
from safety pins it's a washers I don't

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
from safety pins it's a washers I don't
have<00:01:46.380> any<00:01:46.560> oven<00:01:46.740> vent<00:01:47.009> operator<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.609> couldn't

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
have any oven vent operator I couldn't

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.429 
have any oven vent operator I couldn't
find<00:01:48.149> anything<00:01:48.539> because<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> either<00:01:49.049> lost

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
find anything because of either lost

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.370 
find anything because of either lost
summer<00:01:49.770> throwing<00:01:50.100> them<00:01:50.189> away<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.990> can<00:01:51.990> scrape

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
summer throwing them away you can scrape

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
summer throwing them away you can scrape
off<00:01:52.560> paint<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.219> there's<00:01:53.490> metal<00:01:53.789> and<00:01:53.939> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
off paint and there's metal and it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
off paint and there's metal and it's
easy<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> bend<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.689> perfect<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.829> just

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
easy to bend it's perfect so you just

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.440 
easy to bend it's perfect so you just
basically<00:01:58.369> see<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.490> stick<00:01:59.789> it<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
basically see you stick it in there I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.660 
basically see you stick it in there I
was<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:02.210> pointer<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:08.460> then<00:02:08.550> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
was gonna do one pointer and then you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.210 
was gonna do one pointer and then you
stick<00:02:08.910> whatever<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> got<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:13.130> when<00:02:14.130> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
stick whatever you got in there when you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.789 
stick whatever you got in there when you
shut<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> door

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.850 

it<00:02:23.799> doesn't<00:02:24.099> shut<00:02:24.489> off<00:02:24.519> on<00:02:24.970> here<00:02:25.209> nothing

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it doesn't shut off on here nothing

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.470 
it doesn't shut off on here nothing
still<00:02:26.860> good<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.849> another<00:02:28.000> problem<00:02:28.209> like

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
still good that was another problem like

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.880 
still good that was another problem like
when<00:02:28.629> it's<00:02:28.780> just<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.079> little<00:02:29.319> dent

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
when it's just a little dent

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.920 
when it's just a little dent
you'll<00:02:30.370> be<00:02:30.459> puffin<00:02:30.909> he'll<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.750> gone

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
you'll be puffin he'll just be gone

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.899 
you'll be puffin he'll just be gone
because<00:02:32.379> you<00:02:32.409> moved<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.799> little<00:02:32.890> bit<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.790> if

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
because you moved a little bit so if

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.940 
because you moved a little bit so if
it's<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.120> hitting<00:02:34.480> solid<00:02:34.750> or<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.349> it's<00:02:35.530> not

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
it's not hitting solid or if it's not
