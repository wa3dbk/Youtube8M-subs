hi<00:00:00.539> everyone<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:01.079> -<00:00:01.469> with<00:00:01.589> zoomit<00:00:01.860> laboratories

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi everyone I - with zoomit laboratories

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.889 
hi everyone I - with zoomit laboratories
I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> show<00:00:03.090> you<00:00:03.120> how<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.389> use<00:00:03.570> zoomx

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
I'm going to show you how to use zoomx

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:18.920 
I'm going to show you how to use zoomx
excavator<00:00:04.529> clavering<00:00:05.009> substrate

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.660 

if<00:00:19.930> you<00:00:20.110> get<00:00:20.260> this<00:00:20.440> part<00:00:20.680> right<00:00:20.800> it<00:00:21.190> really<00:00:21.460> is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
if you get this part right it really is

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.580 
if you get this part right it really is
that<00:00:21.820> much<00:00:22.000> easier<00:00:22.030> for<00:00:22.540> everything<00:00:22.840> else<00:00:22.960> if

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
that much easier for everything else if

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.230 
that much easier for everything else if
you<00:00:23.650> had<00:00:23.830> exactly<00:00:24.100> the<00:00:24.520> amount<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:24.850> cups<00:00:25.029> it

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
you had exactly the amount of cups it

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.910 
you had exactly the amount of cups it
tells<00:00:25.420> you<00:00:25.600> to<00:00:25.630> amount<00:00:26.110> of<00:00:26.230> water<00:00:26.439> tells<00:00:26.800> you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
tells you to amount of water tells you

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:36.870 
tells you to amount of water tells you
to<00:00:27.099> makes<00:00:27.880> life<00:00:28.119> much<00:00:28.510> easier

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.480 

it's<00:00:37.880> very<00:00:38.150> important<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.750> pack<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.110> all<00:00:39.230> down

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
it's very important to pack it all down

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.130 
it's very important to pack it all down
this<00:00:40.490> technique<00:00:40.910> here<00:00:41.240> is<00:00:41.360> basically<00:00:41.840> going

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
this technique here is basically going

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.950 
this technique here is basically going
to<00:00:42.260> be<00:00:42.410> using<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.130> spoon<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.880> carve<00:00:44.630> out<00:00:44.810> the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
to be using a spoon to carve out the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.020 
to be using a spoon to carve out the
tunnel<00:00:45.290> as<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:45.950> can<00:00:46.100> see<00:00:46.250> from<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.550> side<00:00:46.760> it's

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
tunnel as you can see from the side it's

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.640 
tunnel as you can see from the side it's
super<00:00:47.570> important<00:00:47.990> to<00:00:48.020> make<00:00:48.200> sure<00:00:48.380> it's<00:00:48.530> all

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
super important to make sure it's all

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.080 
super important to make sure it's all
padded<00:00:49.040> in<00:00:49.160> then<00:00:49.340> you<00:00:49.430> can<00:00:49.580> carve<00:00:49.850> away

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
padded in then you can carve away

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.630 
padded in then you can carve away
without<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.540> collapsing<00:00:50.950> and<00:00:51.950> then<00:00:52.280> as<00:00:52.460> if

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
without it collapsing and then as if

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.020 
without it collapsing and then as if
hardens<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.150> become<00:00:53.510> solid

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
hardens and become solid

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.490 
hardens and become solid
so<00:00:56.030> once<00:00:56.270> you've<00:00:56.420> patted<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:56.960> all<00:00:57.110> down<00:00:57.320> it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
so once you've patted it all down it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.680 
so once you've patted it all down it
doesn't<00:00:57.800> look<00:00:57.920> like<00:00:57.950> much<00:00:58.640> sand<00:00:59.000> anymore<00:00:59.420> but

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
doesn't look like much sand anymore but

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.750 
doesn't look like much sand anymore but
we'll<00:01:00.200> be<00:01:00.290> digging<00:01:00.620> up<00:01:00.739> about<00:01:01.100> two-thirds<00:01:01.610> of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
we'll be digging up about two-thirds of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.820 
we'll be digging up about two-thirds of
the<00:01:01.850> sand<00:01:02.090> right<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.510> make<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:02.840> burrow

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.950 

this<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.700> easiest<00:01:11.090> way<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.390> work<00:01:11.630> with<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
this is the easiest way to work with it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.030 
this is the easiest way to work with it
you<00:01:11.990> can<00:01:12.260> all<00:01:12.380> we're<00:01:12.530> going<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.710> do<00:01:12.830> another

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
you can all we're going to do another

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.230 
you can all we're going to do another
side<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:13.550> using<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.910> cork<00:01:14.150> round<00:01:16.030> now<00:01:17.030> we're

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
side with using the cork round now we're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.550 
side with using the cork round now we're
also<00:01:17.360> going<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.660> dig<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.930> up<00:01:17.990> right<00:01:18.200> up<00:01:18.320> against

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
also going to dig it up right up against

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.990 
also going to dig it up right up against
the<00:01:18.680> glass<00:01:18.860> we<00:01:19.130> can<00:01:19.190> actually<00:01:19.400> see<00:01:19.700> them<00:01:19.850> while

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
the glass we can actually see them while

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.090 
the glass we can actually see them while
they're<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.270> their<00:01:20.450> burrow<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.770> as<00:01:24.890> you're

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
they're in their burrow and as you're

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.630 
they're in their burrow and as you're
going<00:01:25.310> along

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
going along

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.210 
going along
be<00:01:25.820> sure<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.030> Pat<00:01:26.360> down<00:01:26.570> these<00:01:26.840> sides<00:01:27.170> don't<00:01:28.010> be

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
be sure to Pat down these sides don't be

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.190 
be sure to Pat down these sides don't be
discouraged<00:01:28.640> if<00:01:28.910> part<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.540> breaks<00:01:29.780> up<00:01:29.990> up

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
discouraged if part of it breaks up up

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
discouraged if part of it breaks up up
you<00:01:30.410> can<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:30.770> restart

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.470 

for<00:01:35.370> this<00:01:35.520> part<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:35.970> we're<00:01:36.120> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.300> use<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
for this part here we're going to use a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.390 
for this part here we're going to use a
cork<00:01:36.840> round<00:01:37.080> put<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.740> against<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.100> glass

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
cork round put it up against the glass

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.080 
cork round put it up against the glass
very<00:01:38.970> slowly<00:01:39.330> Pat<00:01:39.690> down<00:01:39.930> sand<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.940> way

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
very slowly Pat down sand so that way

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.550 
very slowly Pat down sand so that way
when<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.540> finished<00:01:42.780> you'll<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.260> able<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
when it's all finished you'll be able to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
when it's all finished you'll be able to
see<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:43.950> underneath

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.690 

a<00:01:54.259> lot<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> people<00:01:55.590> will<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.130> rocks<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
a lot of people will also use rocks and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.430 
a lot of people will also use rocks and
wood<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.270> visible<00:01:57.600> structure<00:01:57.900> just

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
wood to make this visible structure just

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.690 
wood to make this visible structure just
use<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.770> stand<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.190> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.400> bring<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.580> all

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
use the stand to kind of bring it all

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:18.410 
use the stand to kind of bring it all
together

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.699 

using<00:02:19.420> balloons<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:19.930> pop<00:02:20.079> bottles<00:02:20.439> is<00:02:20.560> there

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
using balloons and pop bottles is there

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.080 
using balloons and pop bottles is there
two<00:02:20.829> easiest<00:02:21.250> ways<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.459> create<00:02:21.879> rounded

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
two easiest ways to create rounded

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.330 
two easiest ways to create rounded
boroughs<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.829> to<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.040> enough

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
boroughs you just have to have enough

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.770 
boroughs you just have to have enough
time<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.760> let<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.060> dry<00:02:25.299> if<00:02:25.480> you're<00:02:25.599> going<00:02:25.689> to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
time to let the dry if you're going to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.690 
time to let the dry if you're going to
use<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.989> balloon<00:02:26.230> method<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.799> with<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.489> pop

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
use the balloon method and with the pop

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.099 
use the balloon method and with the pop
bottles<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.329> literally<00:02:28.599> pull<00:02:28.989> it

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
bottles you literally pull it

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.599 
bottles you literally pull it
immediately<00:02:29.469> right<00:02:29.829> after<00:02:30.159> you've<00:02:30.280> done<00:02:30.459> the

immediately right after you've done the

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:51.800 
immediately right after you've done the
actual<00:02:30.760> structure

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.290 

so<00:03:32.290> with<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.500> leftover<00:03:32.950> sand<00:03:33.520> I'm<00:03:33.910> basically

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
so with the leftover sand I'm basically

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.600 
so with the leftover sand I'm basically
just<00:03:34.420> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.810> create<00:03:35.020> some<00:03:35.200> rock<00:03:36.100> structure

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
just going to create some rock structure

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.920 
just going to create some rock structure
so<00:03:36.820> basically<00:03:37.680> use<00:03:38.680> one<00:03:39.010> end<00:03:39.220> just<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.750> keep<00:03:40.750> it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
so basically use one end just to keep it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.140 
so basically use one end just to keep it
flat<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.440> other<00:03:41.560> end<00:03:41.860> make<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.460> just<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.030> it's

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
flat the other end make it just so it's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.090 
flat the other end make it just so it's
not<00:03:43.300> perfectly<00:03:43.780> round<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.530> then<00:03:44.890> just

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
not perfectly round and then just

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.010 
not perfectly round and then just
randomly<00:03:45.340> anywhere<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.300> can<00:03:46.420> just<00:03:46.630> set<00:03:46.930> it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
randomly anywhere you can just set it

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.080 
randomly anywhere you can just set it
down<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.350> just<00:03:47.530> slowly<00:03:47.860> add<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.640> bottom<00:03:48.820> of

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
down and just slowly add the bottom of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.170 
down and just slowly add the bottom of
it<00:03:49.180> down

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.910 

you'll<00:03:56.720> know<00:03:56.870> let's<00:03:57.019> dry<00:03:57.200> when<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.560> turns<00:03:57.769> a

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
you'll know let's dry when it turns a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.890 
you'll know let's dry when it turns a
light<00:03:58.159> pale<00:03:58.459> color<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.090> it's<00:03:59.299> also<00:03:59.450> hard<00:03:59.840> to

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
light pale color and it's also hard to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:15.580 
light pale color and it's also hard to
the<00:04:00.110> touch

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.440
