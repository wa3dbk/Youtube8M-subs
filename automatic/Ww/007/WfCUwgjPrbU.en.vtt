00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.330 
what do they look like you're designing
for<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:57.810> look<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.259> tell<00:01:59.250> me

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
for them what do they look like tell me

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
for them what do they look like tell me
some<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> characteristics<00:02:00.149> actually

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
some of the characteristics actually

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.030 
some of the characteristics actually
give<00:02:01.259> me<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> waist<00:02:01.680> size<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> bust<00:02:02.610> size<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
give me a waist size or a bust size and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.180 
give me a waist size or a bust size and
we<00:02:05.040> seem<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:07.320> situation<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.950> where

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
we seem to be in a situation now where

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.400 
we seem to be in a situation now where
they've<00:02:08.759> lost<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.270> knowledge<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:10.110> can't

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
they've lost that knowledge they can't

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.920 
they've lost that knowledge they can't
they<00:02:10.860> can't<00:02:10.890> describe<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.760> what<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.720> say

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
they can't describe it what do you say

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.340 
they can't describe it what do you say
so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.950 
so
moving<00:02:13.860> forward<00:02:14.280> well<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:14.940> need<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.660> it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
moving forward well we need to get it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.980 
moving forward well we need to get it
smart<00:02:16.410> about<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.280> gather<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.850> data<00:02:18.210> we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
smart about this and gather the data we

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.500 
smart about this and gather the data we
actually<00:02:19.500> need<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.950> profile<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.580> australian

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
actually need to profile the australian

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
actually need to profile the australian
population<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> we're<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
population we now know that we're a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.340 
population we now know that we're a
diverse<00:02:24.480> population<00:02:25.820> multicultural<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.810> in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
diverse population multicultural so in

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.220 
diverse population multicultural so in
that<00:02:28.710> space<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.700> need<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.270> sample<00:02:30.600> survey

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that space we need to do a sample survey

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.770 
that space we need to do a sample survey
we<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.280> know<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:32.940> we're<00:02:33.270> going<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.570> be

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
we have to know if we're going to be

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.780 
we have to know if we're going to be
good<00:02:33.990> product<00:02:34.440> developers<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.310> country

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
good product developers in this country

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.750 
good product developers in this country
we<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.630> know<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.040> averages<00:02:38.580> are

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
we have to know what the averages are

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760 
we have to know what the averages are
and<00:02:39.120> where<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> starting<00:02:39.960> points<00:02:40.320> are<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
and where the starting points are and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.680 
and where the starting points are and
where<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.130> extremes<00:02:41.550> are<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:42.240> help<00:02:42.510> way

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
where the extremes are we help way

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.200 
where the extremes are we help way
behind<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.470> know<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> first<00:02:44.280> study<00:02:44.730> was<00:02:44.970> done

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
behind you know the first study was done

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.200 
behind you know the first study was done
probably<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> UK<00:02:46.230> i<00:02:46.260> think<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.710> was<00:02:46.860> 10<00:02:47.730> 15

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
probably in the UK i think it was 10 15

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.540 
probably in the UK i think it was 10 15
years<00:02:48.240> ago<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.140> they're<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.010> their<00:02:50.190> second

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
years ago and they're on to their second

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.810 
years ago and they're on to their second
and<00:02:50.670> third<00:02:50.850> studies<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.440> way<00:02:52.740> behind

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
and third studies so we are way behind

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
and third studies so we are way behind
but<00:02:53.820> there's<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.330> aspect<00:02:54.810> about<00:02:54.990> that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
but there's one good aspect about that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.470 
but there's one good aspect about that
because<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.130> means<00:02:56.460> we<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.120> pick<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.450> eye

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
because that means we can pick the eye

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.810 
because that means we can pick the eye
teeth<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.920> good<00:02:59.130> bits<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.760> have

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
teeth out of the good bits that have

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.090 
teeth out of the good bits that have
been<00:03:00.090> done<00:03:00.270> internationally<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.320> do<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
been done internationally and do it a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.850 
been done internationally and do it a
lot<00:03:02.250> smarter<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.600> believe<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.440> do<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.710> a

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
lot smarter and I believe we can do it a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.350 
lot smarter and I believe we can do it a
lot<00:03:05.040> smarter<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.640> would<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.060> see

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
lot smarter and I would like to see

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.140 
lot smarter and I would like to see
Australia<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.290> smoother<00:03:08.000> sadly<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
Australia do it a lot smoother sadly the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.180 
Australia do it a lot smoother sadly the
situation<00:03:09.810> doesn't<00:03:09.960> show<00:03:10.290> signs<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.740> changing

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
situation doesn't show signs of changing

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
situation doesn't show signs of changing
anytime<00:03:11.490> soon<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.540> until<00:03:12.720> someone<00:03:13.110> decides<00:03:13.410> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
anytime soon so until someone decides to
