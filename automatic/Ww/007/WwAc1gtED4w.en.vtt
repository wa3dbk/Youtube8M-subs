00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.710
 the more you die the livelier you are 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.390
 Do you feel yourself 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.390
 you are james yes 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.490
 that is niki lauda ferrari has the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.490
 under contract this nobody 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 they sneak as well as mine 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.070
 grandfather why drove fast 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.070
 because she is asking for it 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.020
 this is an incredible fight between 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.850
 these two blasted drivers 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.130
 at the next race I have the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.560
 you forget you can go to many parties 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.390
 Not everyone loves speed for that 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.940
 But that does not make you world champion 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.770
 you need to be solid I can do it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.670
 Beat me for believing that he is constant 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.600
 to run from race to race 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.729
 it is also his life if it is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.500
 really depends on welcome to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.500
 fleeting of the year 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.850
 I feel responsible for that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.140
 I'll see how you run 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
 win while I'm at my life 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.860
 then you fight for mine too 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.860
 return to formula 1 responsible 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.270
 two days after the start 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 stronger than the fear of death 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.570
 is the will to win 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.090
 yes that was the trainer too fast everything 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.769
 for the win 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.590
 and that comes on 3 october 2013 in the 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:19.660
 Cinemas take two hours and 3 minutes 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:24.200
 and is as in Ron Howard's about it 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.700
 a racer the race driver 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.190
 tomorrow and is thus an action 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.340
 biography I think the whole looks 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.680
 nice from well filled with the tooth of the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.349
 Time 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.480
 daniel brÃ¼hl also plays with it and 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.230
 I like that one of the likes as well 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.870
 chris hemsworth olivia wild and natalie 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.519
 dormer I think we'll see each other there 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.480
 any case super criticism I'm happy 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.480
 and see you
