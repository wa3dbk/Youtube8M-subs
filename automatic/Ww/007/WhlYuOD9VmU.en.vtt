00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000 position:98%
The exhibition Passion for Renoir. The Collection of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.000 position:98%
on display at the Museo del Prado, is the first monographic exhibition to be devoted to the artist in this country.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:29.000 position:98%
It comprises an outstanding group of works by Renoir dating from his early and most renowned periods up to around 1900.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.000 position:97%
In total, the exhibition includes 31 works that cover all the major genres in which Renoir worked.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.000 position:97%
The artist was not only an Impressionist like his fellow members of that group, in addition,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.000 position:98%
and in a profound sense, he was also a painter after the Old Masters.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.000 position:97%
On numerous occasions throughout his career Renoir revealed his fascination with the type of painting to be seen in museums:

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.000 position:97%
the great Venetian painters, Flemish painting and even Spanish painting,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.000 position:97%
including Velázquez, whose work he encountered at first hand during his trip to Madrid in 1892, when he visited the Prado.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:17.000 position:98%
In addition, Renoir greatly appreciated the French tradition of painting, in particular the 18th century,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.000 position:97%
and it can thus be said that his dual nature as an artist is fully revealed here; on the one hand as an Impressionist,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.200 position:97%
and on the other as a painter fully conscious of the great tradition of European painting to which he considered himself heir.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.200 position:98%
The works from Clark’s collection have been divided into six sections, starting with portraits.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.200 position:98%
Renoir was a painter particularly attracted to the human form. Together with Degas, he was the most interested in this subject among the Impressionists

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.200 position:97%
and the group of portraits on display in this section is further enriched by two self-portraits,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200 position:72%
the first of which is outstandingly expressive

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200 position:97%
while the second, which dates from a slightly later period, is much more serene.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.200 position:69%
We also have the portrait of Père Fournaise,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.200 position:97%
which is typical of Renoir’s early period and is highly characteristic of Impressionism.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.200 position:98%
Above all, however, Renoir was a painter of female figures and the exhibition includes portraits such as the one of Durand-Ruel’s daughter, Thérèse Berard.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.200 position:97%
His most important contribution in this area, however, took the form of his compositions of young girls depicted in interiors,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200 position:98%
in a spontaneous manner and in a variety of poses. These are very sensual, intimate works

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.200 position:97%
and fall within a tradition that connects to 18th-century French painting.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200 position:98%
This is the aspect of Renoir that is best represented in Clark’s collection and the one that most appealed to collectors.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.200 position:98%
We also have examples of landscape, which was a key genre for Impressionism

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.200 position:98%
given that this movement aimed to represent nature in the most objective manner possible.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200 position:98%
The exhibition includes a sizeable group of works including various masterpieces from the artist’s early period

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.200 position:98%
in which we see Renoir’s particular contribution to the genre through his use of a very broad brushstroke

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.200 position:98%
with evanescent touches of pigment and velvety colours, particularly his characteristic blue.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.200 position:98%
Also on display are flower paintings and still lifes. Renoir was truly a painter of flowers

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.200 position:97%
and was particularly fond of this genre as it gave him great freedom

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.200 position:97%
and allowed for a daring treatment of colour, which is loose, fresh and vivid.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.200 position:97%
The artist began his career as a decorative painter of porcelain and then moved on to flower painting.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200 position:97%
Later on in his career he still revealed his fascination for a motif

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.200 position:97%
that allowed him to convey his characteristically lively, brilliant palette.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.200 position:78%
The still lifes, particularly two of them, Onions,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200 position:98%
Clark’s favourite work and a highly Cézanne-like composition with a fruit bowl,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.200 position:97%
allow us to appreciate Renoir’s contribution to this genre, which had a particularly rich tradition in France.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.200 position:98%
The artist takes 18th-century models as his starting point to arrive at the innovations of his contemporary, Cézanne.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.200 position:97%
Within the painting of the human form the nude was also an outstandingly important genre for Renoir,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.200 position:97%
particularly after his Italian trip of 1881-82 when he made contact with the great tradition of the French Renaissance

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.200 position:97%
and was profoundly attracted to the primacy of the drawn line and outline.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.200 position:97%
Renoir evolved towards a style close to that of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, the great 19th-century French master of the nude.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.200 position:98%
Bather combing her Hair, for example, reveals a similarity with the ideas of late Ingres.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.200 position:97%
It also shows how Renoir became a sort of intermediary stage between Ingres and Neo-classicism

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.200 position:97%
and the revival of form and line undertaken by subsequent artists of the early 20th century.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.200 position:98%
It is worth noting that both Picasso and Matisse, perhaps the two most important painters of the 20th century

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.200 position:92%
and both champions of form, both highly appreciated Renoir.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.200 position:98%
The exhibition concludes with various works from a slightly later date, after 1890,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.200 position:97%
although they are few in number. The latest is a portrait of the young Jacques Fray,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200 position:97%
a fine portrait of a young boy of around 1903-04, dating from Renoir’s last period

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.200 position:97%
in which his brushstroke was much looser and in which we see a use of golden light and a remarkable sense of warmth.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.200 position:98%
This period of Renoir was highly appreciated in the first half of the 20th century but was perhaps the one that least interested Clark.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.200 position:97%
His collection thus includes fewer works from this period than from the early period of the 1870s and 1880s,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.200 position:97%
corresponding to the most original aspect of Renoir’s style and the one that might seem to be of most interest here.
