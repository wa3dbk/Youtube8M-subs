00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.900
 as well as tom schwegmann christian ertel the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.610
 motorsport for the dlrg stress and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.290
 has started here at the German 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.449
 championships the goal to the final 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.370
 to swim in the rescue sport is the 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.800
 Rising world record holder with the 4 x 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690

 sixth in the German 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 championships of swimmers succeeded 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.749
 He was twice the final winner last year 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.909
 to reach 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.679
 It is enough to achieve these successes 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.780
 not from two to three times a week 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.920
 the dlrg to actually swim 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.239
 That's why Christian trains in the gym 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.409
 swimming club so on his 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.409
 to come to workouts 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 I start for the Berlin tsc and that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.899
 now for four years 2011 until 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 moved here and has to look where I am 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.130
 train and there it was with mine 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.550
 first contact person 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.350
 five times a week with them into the water 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.120
 but also only swim training because the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 According ground is no place remains 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.380
 to use group fins chips and 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.610
 that's why training in germany remains 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.440
 as informed about 50 meters 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.090
 freistil christian last year 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.490
 at the german championship the 13 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.470
 place at the German short train 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.660
 championships in november 2014 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.720
 he fought his way over 4 x 50 meters 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.070
 freistil with his team bronze this 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.760
 year, christian is above all concerned 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.760
 to get experience 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.700
 for me it is very pleasant here too 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.080
 But just do not start this pressure 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.430
 as in rescue swimming 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.410
 There you go to the best six 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.890
 germany at the wm or he start 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.470
 is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.550
 one has the impression of success 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.680
 shape for the team 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.510
 Here you are more one of many and 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.050
 tries his personal success too 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.790
 to reach 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.560
 that's the final participation for me 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.600
 top 20 to reach 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.950
 and there the pressure is not quite as high 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.790
 like now with the national team 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.650
 be on the move 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.880
 Of course , that's important for mine 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.950
 Team also to be good because I hold myself 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 always support 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.450
 ulrich and that's why I want to be here 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.110
 just bring on power but it is 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.760
 much more pleasant 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.080
 besides, you can get a lot of the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.800
 all top striker who did something 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.720
 abgucken 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.360
 these are specialists on the tracks 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.500
 taste to raul whatever and there 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.080
 we can of course as a rescue 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.910
 the other has a different focus 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.230
 have something to look like again 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.640
 make the state better we do 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.959
 a better turn as drawers 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.340
 maybe even better crawl 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.810
 that is why a experience is itself 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.810
 It is always worthwhile to attend 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.560
 Kerstin reached seventh place 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.280
 50 meters freestyle and is thus this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.319
 Year also a serious one 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.510
 candidates for a place in the dglg 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.250
 national team no rescue 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.150
 athlete is so far on 50 meters 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.739
 swum faster 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 moreover, all the sponge 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.810
 rescue athlete with her stables in 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.810
 the top ten 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.500
 the day of competition has now run for you 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.150
 the season is always a very good one 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.890
 we can be satisfied and at 1 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.690
 expandable but the view of the em 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.690
 Qualification to satisfactory
