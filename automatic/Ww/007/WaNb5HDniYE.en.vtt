body<00:02:11.780> types<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.230> gets<00:02:12.410> could<00:02:12.560> say<00:02:13.690> you'll

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
body types that gets could say you'll

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.380 
body types that gets could say you'll
notice<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.500> all<00:02:16.220> three<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> these<00:02:16.879> positions

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
notice that all three of these positions

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.780 
notice that all three of these positions
look<00:02:17.840> very<00:02:18.140> different<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.220> fact<00:02:19.430> they're

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
look very different but in fact they're

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.660 
look very different but in fact they're
all<00:02:20.030> correct<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.799> let's<00:02:21.830> look<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.190> person<00:02:22.489> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
all correct so let's look a person a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.009 
all correct so let's look a person a
person<00:02:23.629> a<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.730> relatively<00:02:25.730> proportional<00:02:26.540> his

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
person a is relatively proportional his

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.229 
person a is relatively proportional his
torso<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.680> his<00:02:27.950> legs<00:02:28.280> are<00:02:28.519> relatively

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
torso and his legs are relatively

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.699 
torso and his legs are relatively
proportional<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.959> what<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.110> mean<00:02:30.319> but<00:02:30.500> when<00:02:30.650> I

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
proportional to what I mean but when I

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.699 
proportional to what I mean but when I
say<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.720> he<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.019> correct<00:02:33.290> starting

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
say that he is in a correct starting

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.039 
say that he is in a correct starting
position<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.849> barbell<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.510> over<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> center

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
position the barbell is over the center

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.170 
position the barbell is over the center
of<00:02:36.110> his<00:02:36.170> foot<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.709> his<00:02:37.370> shoulder<00:02:37.700> blades<00:02:37.819> are

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
of his foot and his shoulder blades are

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.449 
of his foot and his shoulder blades are
over<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.660> barbell<00:02:39.019> this<00:02:39.799> is<00:02:39.950> going<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> put

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
over the barbell this is going to put

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.020 
over the barbell this is going to put
his<00:02:40.819> hips<00:02:41.769> pretty<00:02:42.769> neutral<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.910> going

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
his hips pretty neutral and it's going

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.850 
his hips pretty neutral and it's going
to<00:02:44.120> put<00:02:44.269> his<00:02:44.390> back<00:02:44.690> at<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.079> 45-degree<00:02:45.829> angle

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
to put his back at a 45-degree angle

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.259 
to put his back at a 45-degree angle
most<00:02:46.790> people<00:02:47.060> would<00:02:47.150> say<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> textbook

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
most people would say this is a textbook

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.979 
most people would say this is a textbook
deadlift<00:02:50.269> setup<00:02:51.489> but<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.519> works<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:53.569> him<00:02:53.630> not

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
deadlift setup but it works for him not

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.949 
deadlift setup but it works for him not
necessarily<00:02:54.500> for<00:02:54.680> these<00:02:54.799> two<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.720> let's<00:02:56.720> move

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
necessarily for these two so let's move

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.289 
necessarily for these two so let's move
on<00:02:57.200> person<00:02:58.160> B<00:02:59.319> has<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.349> relatively<00:03:01.220> short<00:03:01.819> torso

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
on person B has a relatively short torso

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.199 
on person B has a relatively short torso
in<00:03:02.690> relation<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.110> his<00:03:03.349> legs<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.549> short<00:03:04.970> torso

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
in relation to his legs so short torso

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.800 
in relation to his legs so short torso
long<00:03:05.780> legs<00:03:06.170> these<00:03:06.980> type<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> people<00:03:07.549> are<00:03:07.880> six

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
long legs these type of people are six

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
legs so tall and lanky I guess you could

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.770 
legs so tall and lanky I guess you could
say<00:03:14.950> now<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.280> person<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.850> in<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.180> correct

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
say now this person is in a correct

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.660 
say now this person is in a correct
starting<00:03:18.019> position<00:03:18.280> barbell<00:03:19.280> over<00:03:19.579> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
starting position barbell over the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.819 
starting position barbell over the
center<00:03:19.910> deployed<00:03:20.239> shoulder<00:03:20.930> blades<00:03:21.170> over<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
center deployed shoulder blades over the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.160 
center deployed shoulder blades over the
bar<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.340> you'll<00:03:22.850> notice<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.630> their<00:03:23.870> hips

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
bar but you'll notice that their hips

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.270 
bar but you'll notice that their hips
are<00:03:24.380> much<00:03:24.920> higher<00:03:25.250> than<00:03:25.639> person<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.569> someone<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
are much higher than person a someone a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.400 
are much higher than person a someone a
relatively<00:03:28.280> proportional<00:03:28.819> bill<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.870> hips<00:03:30.260> are

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
relatively proportional bill so hips are

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.289 
relatively proportional bill so hips are
much<00:03:30.560> higher<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.519> can<00:03:31.730> put<00:03:31.849> their<00:03:32.030> back

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
much higher and this can put their back

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.530 
much higher and this can put their back
much<00:03:32.959> more<00:03:32.989> horizontal<00:03:33.920> almost<00:03:34.540> parallel

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
much more horizontal almost parallel

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.920 
much more horizontal almost parallel
with<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.200> floor<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.510> correct

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
with the floor this is the correct

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.920 
with the floor this is the correct

starting position or person B these type

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.629 
starting position or person B these type
of<00:03:41.959> people<00:03:42.380> are<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.190> be<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> little<00:03:43.459> more

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
of people are going to be a little more

more<00:04:20.270> leg<00:04:20.630> higher<00:04:21.190> than<00:04:22.190> person<00:04:22.550> B<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.840> that's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
more leg higher than person B so that's

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.510 
more leg higher than person B so that's
really<00:04:24.260> all<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.500> wanted<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.830> illustrate<00:04:24.950> is<00:04:25.400> the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
really all I wanted to illustrate is the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.250 
really all I wanted to illustrate is the
fact<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.880> everyone's<00:04:26.540> starting<00:04:26.840> position

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
fact that everyone's starting position

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.210 
fact that everyone's starting position
in<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.470> deadlift<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:27.860> going<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.130> look

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
in the deadlift is going to look

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.790 
in the deadlift is going to look
different<00:04:28.340> based<00:04:29.000> on<00:04:29.300> how<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.510> are<00:04:29.780> built<00:04:30.050> so

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
different based on how you are built so

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.390 
different based on how you are built so
do<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:31.760> listen<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.240> general<00:04:33.050> advice<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.770> get

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
do not listen to general advice of get

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.730 
do not listen to general advice of get
your<00:04:34.520> hips<00:04:34.640> down<00:04:34.910> get<00:04:35.540> your<00:04:35.570> hips<00:04:35.780> up<00:04:36.050> your

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
your hips down get your hips up your

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.020 
your hips down get your hips up your
back<00:04:36.920> should<00:04:37.130> be<00:04:37.220> at<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.340> 45<00:04:37.730> degree<00:04:37.760> angle

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
back should be at a 45 degree angle

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.900 
back should be at a 45 degree angle
because<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.620> depends<00:04:40.220> on<00:04:40.250> how<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.700> are

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
because it really depends on how you are

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.390 
because it really depends on how you are
built<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:42.020> hurts<00:04:42.440> my<00:04:42.590> ears<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.250> hear

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
built and it hurts my ears to hear

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.660 
built and it hurts my ears to hear
people<00:04:43.760> telling<00:04:44.510> someone<00:04:45.440> built<00:04:45.650> like<00:04:45.800> person

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
people telling someone built like person

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.200 
people telling someone built like person
B<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.480> get<00:04:48.170> your<00:04:48.380> butt<00:04:48.680> down<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.310> squat<00:04:50.060> the

weight up you're using all back when in

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.010 
weight up you're using all back when in
reality<00:04:52.330> that's<00:04:53.330> just<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.690> way<00:04:53.810> they're
