00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.560
 for me 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.130
 not bad 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.519
 6 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.519
 ben ali 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.770
 hello to all these watchmen c6 naxos 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.210
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.640
 new match as usual on 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.790
 battlefield 3 but this time it's 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.619
 glitch the very very impressive one is going 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.510
 allow you to ride on one of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.300
 roofs of the amap epicenter of some 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.770
 way I love in general thanks to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 invisible walls finally brief it's the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.059
 total a goal of sick so for 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 alizÃ©e switch you have to go 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.510
 of course will map epicenter in conquest 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.550
 I want to clarify this is enough 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.130
 important to spot you so a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 conquest direct you to point b and 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.930
 so next to point b as I like 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.820
 I show it alas there is a door a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.739
 sort of brief shop doors with 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.030
 debris you pass the goal is to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 go behind the debris so you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.050
 go up behind and so you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 exit through the other door of the store 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.220
 dhr and once that's good you go 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.899
 see already that the beach and well a heap 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.360
 but simply because you are you 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.160
 are in sowing or tough map because there is a 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.619
 invisible wall and you can not jump 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.420
 in the street short you will get here 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.080
 now so already small graphic bug 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.410
 very nice tosh I want to clarify so 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.209
 you climb on this debris there by cons 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.830
 so you go up and you're going to have to 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.259
 go to the right so you go up on 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.890
 the right and has it already you have a nice 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.810
 visual about point b so a good way 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.039
 to defend it then following a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.380
 leak takes place here you 're going to have to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.110
 climb on a small the edge is then 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.330
 back on this debris so he climbed on 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.709
 the other is here must be a little bit 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.479
 careful because you have to jump on a whole 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.369
 small invisible wall and the invisible wall 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.679
 continue in front of you so you aim for the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.660
 ground you advance little by little and a 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.250
 once you see the border we're going 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.110
 to say louey the border there you see 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.039
 in front you just have to follow and 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.330
 market above 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.670
 are you going to do that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.319
 walk on the invisible wall from where from 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 the interest of switch thanks to the wall 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.310
 invisible you can go on the roof 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.009
 so I want to clarify that this glitch has 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.410
 been found by tony duran that I 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.670
 congratulates for that matter but it's not 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.340
 all I managed to find a little 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.600
 exclusivity thanks to that tch so the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.130
 tony duran's purpose allows 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.660
 to go on the balcony when I'm in 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.700
 train to do it there you do like 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.900
 me and you will be able to arrive on the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.840
 balcony which is just below in 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.360
 lying down and so marrow excluded that I 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 found and able to get on the roof 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.600
 who next 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.550
 so it's very simple you just have to 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.620
 resume the path you did 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.700
 in the beginning before it's at least a moment 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.900
 you will see that you are going to have to 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.670
 jump to continue moving forward 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.320
 you climb on this kind of small 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.300
 village and you look to the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.130
 building and the goal is just to move forward 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.540
 as I am doing in the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.550
 video so you quietly advance 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.010
 and you jump and once it's good 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.800
 and well you arrived on this famous 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.360
 roof an excluded that I found everything to the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.090
 specify that I do not have views on 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.860
 youtube or other weird short string 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.340
 here I found this excluded and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.050
 I hope you like it so here you go 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.200
 just like you have the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.300
 see a good view on all the points 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.740
 which is quite a good way 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.750
 to have fun with your friends 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.690
 frankly it's a fabulous goal 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.390
 fabulous fabulous and who I hope you 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.560
