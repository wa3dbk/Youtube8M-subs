00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
and 12 15 this is a 20-inch wheel so

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.070 
and 12 15 this is a 20-inch wheel so
then<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.240> wheel<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.630> set<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.049> for

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
then the wheel can be set up for

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.940 
then the wheel can be set up for
beginners<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.450> for<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> season<00:01:31.140> experts<00:01:31.619> who

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
time the wheel is double trouble however

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
time the wheel is double trouble however
the<00:01:41.659> wheel<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.399> used<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.729> single

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the wheel can be used in a single

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.080 
the wheel can be used in a single
treadle<00:01:46.130> because<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> efficiencies<00:01:47.909> and

again<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.569> slide<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.900> give<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.319> little

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
again just slide it in give it a little

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.500 
again just slide it in give it a little
time<00:02:54.019> snaps<00:02:55.019> into<00:02:55.230> place<00:02:56.209> make<00:02:57.209> sure<00:02:57.239> your

physical feedback to the spinner that

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.500 
physical feedback to the spinner that
you<00:04:06.389> have<00:04:06.540> reached<00:04:07.489> full<00:04:08.489> throw<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.389> need

you have reached full throw and you need

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.190 
you have reached full throw and you need
to<00:04:09.629> press<00:04:10.200> with<00:04:10.379> your<00:04:10.530> other<00:04:10.650> foot<00:04:11.010> now<00:04:12.200> most

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
period of time don't need this but

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.420 
period of time don't need this but
starting<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.470> this<00:04:19.620> wheel<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.220> nice

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
starting with this wheel this is a nice

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.980 
starting with this wheel this is a nice
way<00:04:20.699> to<00:04:20.759> get<00:04:21.359> used<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> throw<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
way to get used to the throw of the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.469 
way to get used to the throw of the
treadle<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.199> then<00:04:25.979> once<00:04:26.250> you've<00:04:26.460> gotten<00:04:27.270> used

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
treadle and then once you've gotten used

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:35.120 
treadle and then once you've gotten used
to<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:28.520> we<00:04:29.520> include<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:33.680> assembly<00:04:34.680> again

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779 
and you're ready to go you can hear the

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.149 
and you're ready to go you can hear the
movement<00:04:53.779> of<00:04:53.809> the<00:04:53.869> wheels<00:04:54.080> very<00:04:54.439> smooth<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
movement of the wheels very smooth and

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.389 
movement of the wheels very smooth and
very<00:04:55.249> quiet<00:04:56.709> as<00:04:57.709> you<00:04:57.860> can<00:04:57.979> tell<00:04:58.039> the

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:58.399 
very quiet as you can tell the

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.309 
very quiet as you can tell the
efficiency<00:04:58.939> here<00:04:59.360> as<00:04:59.599> well<00:04:59.899> we'll<00:05:00.139> continue

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
efficiency here as well we'll continue

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.929 
efficiency here as well we'll continue
to<00:05:00.559> spend<00:05:01.029> multiple<00:05:02.029> revolutions<00:05:03.699> the<00:05:04.699> heel

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
to spend multiple revolutions the heel

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.699 
to spend multiple revolutions the heel
rests<00:05:05.919> allow<00:05:06.919> for<00:05:07.539> placing<00:05:08.539> of<00:05:08.659> the<00:05:08.749> feet<00:05:08.989> the

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
nice wide stance most traditional wheels

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.809 
nice wide stance most traditional wheels
have<00:05:13.369> a<00:05:13.399> very<00:05:13.639> narrow<00:05:13.939> on<00:05:14.689> stand<00:05:15.139> so<00:05:15.819> for

have a very narrow on stand so for

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.939 
have a very narrow on stand so for
myself<00:05:17.239> and<00:05:17.509> others<00:05:17.749> the<00:05:18.229> white<00:05:18.409> stance<00:05:18.709> makes

myself and others the white stance makes

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.529 
myself and others the white stance makes
it<00:05:19.099> very<00:05:19.189> comfortable<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:19.849> spin<00:05:20.209> for<00:05:20.389> long

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
it very comfortable to spin for long

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.769 
it very comfortable to spin for long
periods<00:05:20.569> of<00:05:20.929> time<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:22.269> because<00:05:23.269> the<00:05:23.419> effort

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779 
periods of time and because the effort

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.729 
periods of time and because the effort
is<00:05:23.929> so<00:05:24.259> minut<00:05:25.029> with<00:05:26.029> this<00:05:26.209> wheel<00:05:26.739> that

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:27.739 
is so minut with this wheel that

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:29.999 
is so minut with this wheel that
starting<00:05:28.519> it<00:05:28.639> with<00:05:28.789> a<00:05:28.849> single<00:05:29.300> foot<00:05:29.539> is

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
starting it with a single foot is

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.619 
starting it with a single foot is
absolutely<00:05:31.009> no<00:05:31.159> problem<00:05:31.610> so<00:05:31.969> really<00:05:32.179> consider

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
absolutely no problem so really consider

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.209 
absolutely no problem so really consider
this<00:05:32.809> but<00:05:33.019> the<00:05:33.139> single<00:05:33.499> and<00:05:33.619> double<00:05:33.889> treadle

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
this but the single and double treadle

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
the bottom of this wheel that allows it

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.869 
the bottom of this wheel that allows it
to<00:05:42.979> maintain<00:05:43.819> a<00:05:44.199> good<00:05:45.199> good<00:05:45.769> footing<00:05:46.159> and<00:05:46.339> it

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
to maintain a good good footing and it

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.549 
to maintain a good good footing and it
won't<00:05:47.029> walk<00:05:47.269> away<00:05:47.539> from<00:05:47.749> you<00:05:47.899> as<00:05:48.049> you<00:05:48.169> were

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:48.559 
won't walk away from you as you were

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:54.009 
won't walk away from you as you were
enjoying<00:05:49.249> your<00:05:49.519> time<00:05:52.569> and<00:05:53.569> I<00:05:53.659> think<00:05:53.749> that

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.019
