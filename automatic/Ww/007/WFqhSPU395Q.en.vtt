00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
review i've seen that hspa+ has not been

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.350 
review i've seen that hspa+ has not been
I<00:00:13.170> guess<00:00:13.259> active<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.860> city<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.549> you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
I guess active in that city so you

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.960 
I guess active in that city so you
haven't<00:00:16.080> been<00:00:16.740> able<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> results<00:00:17.640> or

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
haven't been able to see the results or

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
haven't been able to see the results or
the<00:00:18.300> speed<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.740> tease<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.789> called<00:00:21.060> 4G<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the speed of a tease so called 4G and so

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
the speed of a tease so called 4G and so
far<00:00:23.189> I'm<00:00:23.400> getting<00:00:23.640> amazing<00:00:24.000> speeds<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
far I'm getting amazing speeds and I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
far I'm getting amazing speeds and I
just<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.650> blown<00:00:25.980> away<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.570> up

you<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.320> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> speed<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.129> getting<00:00:38.309> so

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
you how kind of speed up and getting so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
you how kind of speed up and getting so
this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.530> pretty<00:00:40.710> quick<00:00:41.040> guys<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> lot

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this is pretty quick guys this is a lot

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
this is pretty quick guys this is a lot
faster<00:00:42.780> than<00:00:43.020> t<00:00:43.200> mobile's<00:00:43.559> 4g<00:00:43.620> at<00:00:44.100> least<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.370> my

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
faster than t mobile's 4g at least in my

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
faster than t mobile's 4g at least in my
area<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.809> speeds<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.379> been

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
area and these speeds have been

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.420 
area and these speeds have been
averaging<00:00:47.239> pretty<00:00:48.239> much<00:00:48.590> Donna<00:00:49.590> daily<00:00:49.920> basis

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
averaging pretty much Donna daily basis

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
averaging pretty much Donna daily basis
now<00:00:50.690> occasionally<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> 2<00:00:52.469> megabits<00:00:52.829> down

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
now occasionally I get a 2 megabits down

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.720 
now occasionally I get a 2 megabits down
or<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.489> mega<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:54.449> megabit<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.079> but

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
or three mega one megabit down but

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
or three mega one megabit down but
overall<00:00:56.780> i've<00:00:57.780> been<00:00:57.989> getting<00:00:58.129> 710<00:00:59.129> I've<00:00:59.370> got

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
overall i've been getting 710 I've got

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.240 
overall i've been getting 710 I've got
11<00:01:00.180> let's<00:01:01.020> try<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.440> more<00:01:01.559> time<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.129> can

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
11 let's try it one more time so you can

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.110 
11 let's try it one more time so you can
see<00:01:02.430> how<00:01:02.579> consistently<00:01:03.449> speeds<00:01:03.750> are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.660 

and<00:01:10.690> there<00:01:10.870> you<00:01:10.960> go<00:01:10.990> very<00:01:11.500> very<00:01:11.680> impressive

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
and there you go very very impressive

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.930 
and there you go very very impressive
with<00:01:12.910> these<00:01:13.060> speeds<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.690> can<00:01:14.790> can't<00:01:15.790> believe

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
with these speeds I can can't believe

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.130 
with these speeds I can can't believe
I'm<00:01:16.000> getting<00:01:16.150> on<00:01:16.360> considering<00:01:16.720> us<00:01:16.870> all<00:01:17.020> these

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
I'm getting on considering us all these

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.480 
I'm getting on considering us all these
reviews<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.800> was<00:01:17.920> kind<00:01:18.100> of<00:01:18.130> horrible

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
reviews and it was kind of horrible

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.860 
reviews and it was kind of horrible
speeds<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.180> again<00:01:19.450> I'm<00:01:19.540> kind<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.750> get<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
speeds and again I'm kind of get the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.180 
speeds and again I'm kind of get the
same<00:01:20.080> thing<00:01:20.200> as<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.410> last<00:01:20.680> one<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.100> was

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
same thing as that last one so I was

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.940 
same thing as that last one so I was
going<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.400> go<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.640> results<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:23.800> can

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
going to go to the results and you can

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.910 
going to go to the results and you can
see<00:01:24.130> seven<00:01:25.090> megabits<00:01:25.510> 11<00:01:26.020> megabits<00:01:26.410> i<00:01:26.560> have<00:01:26.680> 2

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
see seven megabits 11 megabits i have 2

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.850 
see seven megabits 11 megabits i have 2
6-4<00:01:27.910> 6-4<00:01:29.100> 10<00:01:30.100> megabits<00:01:30.670> these<00:01:31.270> are<00:01:31.420> all<00:01:31.660> on<00:01:32.050> 3g

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
6-4 6-4 10 megabits these are all on 3g

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.760 
6-4 6-4 10 megabits these are all on 3g
so<00:01:33.190> these<00:01:33.760> are<00:01:33.940> amazing<00:01:34.330> speeds<00:01:34.930> guys<00:01:35.200> so<00:01:35.500> if

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
so these are amazing speeds guys so if

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.840 
so these are amazing speeds guys so if
you<00:01:35.950> have<00:01:36.300> hspa+<00:01:37.300> in<00:01:37.900> your<00:01:38.770> city<00:01:39.070> which<00:01:39.310> agency
