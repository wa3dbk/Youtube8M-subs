 when so much energy is spent on it 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.439
 to make a beautiful morning bride 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.540
 forget that the bridegroom should 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.200
 something to do this day and take care 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.360

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.060
 it cause a morning of the bride and groom 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.190
 You can spend both at home and somewhere in 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.570
 some interesting place it might be 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.890
 and indoor area 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.290
 hotel 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.520
 I do not know the parents house I wonder what 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.470
 that place theater cafe so maybe 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.880
 to nature 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.780
 Now any options are available here. 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.869
 only question 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.670
 budget and probably the decorator that is how 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.440
 it's all beautiful to make it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.240
 looked beautiful to make it beautiful 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.009
 looked at the picture and that was even 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.170
 I feel relaxed and hive 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.770
 life please tell me what are the advantages and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.060
 cons have a joint morning about 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.450
 meeting together there are both advantages and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.400
 cons it is perfect for couples 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.920
 which are more probably 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.080
 friends and be comfortable together 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.959
 don't want to part even for the sake of one 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 only morning when they are together they 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.320
 liberated 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.959
 they support each other they feel comfortable 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.200
 comfortable and easy but always 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.760
 there are certain disadvantages that is 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 romance disappears first meeting 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.070
 at first sight when they first 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.100
 see the bride beautiful well-dressed 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.750
 agitated and unusual and there is always 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.640
 such a moment that if to meet 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.980
 present friends and girlfriends to they 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.140
 create a little bit of vanity and a little bit 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.549
 make a mess of this first meeting and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.250
 and morning fees 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.019
 so the joint morning of the bride is always 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.640
 need to be viewed from all sides as with 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.930
 The benefits are so much from the benefits 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.019
 profitable and interesting 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.030
 zhen you mentioned the romantic 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.160
 Please tell me the first meeting 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.410
 more about that which is the same 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.420
 There are options which pluses 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.970
 because it usually happens very 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.280
 beautiful and very catchy for 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 newlyweds 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.820
 usually standard classic 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.220
 the ransom kills every kind of romance first 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.799
 meeting and many girls dream about it 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.010
 to the groom entered the room or somewhere else 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.660
 then I saw her see his eyes and therefore 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.049
 as a rule, the first meeting we try 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.290
 hold very romantic and beautiful it 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.450
 maybe departure 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.819
 filtering when by the European rite 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.269
 dad leads the bride to the bridegroom 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.400
 tracks and he sees her for the first time it can 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.739
 be and a date in some very 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.659
 an important place for honeymooners it can 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.780
 be the number where the bride is going either 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.780
 her girl room is the most important thing 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.390
 must be very beautiful romantic and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.280
 cause beautiful emotions in themselves 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.439
 newlyweds and people who will 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.840
 next to this day is not even really 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.299
 All this is very nice is usually obtained 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.030
 and romantic but what about those couples 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.290
 who still want to make their morning 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.039
 some elements of redemption 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.780
 but make it original for this 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.519
 the moment there are many options than to replace 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.039
 standard buyback it may be 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.169
 some games in the style of quest around the city 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.120
 where can I find a bridal bouquet beautifully 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.449
 present on the presidency on 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.669
 Athos Bay this can be done by sending 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.710
 groom's friends take off play together 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.690
 Any whole strategy can be 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.000
 come up with some interesting tests 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.180
 which will be made exactly in the city 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.889
 or in an unusual place that will remind 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.599
 newlyweds let's say about their first 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.580
 date and first presented bouquet 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.320
 maybe even a first kiss here 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.840
 it is important to include a little imagination 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.699
 think of what you wonder what 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.860
 you engaged how to fold your 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.960
 relationship and 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.960
 probably all this will arise itself 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:05.909
 and I remind you that there was a special one 

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:07.829

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:11.129
