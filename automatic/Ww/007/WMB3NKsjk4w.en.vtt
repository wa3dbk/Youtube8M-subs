and an unspecified quad core processor

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
and an unspecified quad core processor
and<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> archos<00:01:02.670> gamepad<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:04.260> were

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and that is the archos gamepad we were

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.929 
and that is the archos gamepad we were
playing<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> couple<00:01:04.830> games<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> earlier<00:01:05.670> and

playing a couple games on it earlier and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
playing a couple games on it earlier and
it<00:01:06.060> seems<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> work<00:01:06.450> pretty<00:01:06.630> well<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> games

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it seems to work pretty well the games

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.429 
it seems to work pretty well the games
will<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.729> supported<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
will have to be supported and it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.250 
will have to be supported and it
features<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> neat<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:12.049> software<00:01:13.049> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
features a neat little software that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
when you can map some of the buttons and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
when you can map some of the buttons and
do<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> bunch<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.840> stuff<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
