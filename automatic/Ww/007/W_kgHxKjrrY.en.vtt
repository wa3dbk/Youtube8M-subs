out here for an open jump shot because

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.870 
out here for an open jump shot because
our<00:01:33.390> first<00:01:33.660> priority<00:01:34.289> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.800> covering<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.789> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
our first priority is a covering of the

our first priority is a covering of the
basket<00:01:36.420> okay<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.140> whether<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> player<00:01:38.429> gets

three is in the right position to be

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
three is in the right position to be

able to defend the basket and cut that
one<00:01:44.130> player<00:01:44.429> off<00:01:44.640> before<00:01:45.240> he's<00:01:45.660> able<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.959> get

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
one player off before he's able to get

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.169 
one player off before he's able to get
to<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.410> rim<00:01:46.610> okay<00:01:47.610> let's<00:01:47.910> see<00:01:48.030> how<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
to the rim okay let's see how the

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.090 
to the rim okay let's see how the
rotations<00:01:48.720> work<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.679> this<00:01:49.830> drill

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
rotations work here because this drill

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.410 
rotations work here because this drill
is<00:01:50.220> real<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.580> only<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> first<00:01:50.910> stage<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is real that's only the first stage of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.960 
is real that's only the first stage of
the<00:01:51.509> drill<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> drill<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.319> really<00:01:52.709> about<00:01:53.009> how

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the drill the drill is really about how

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.150 
the drill the drill is really about how
the<00:01:54.030> players<00:01:54.479> move<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.410> ball<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.649> swung

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
the players move as the ball is swung

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.309 
the players move as the ball is swung
around<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.819> perimeter<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:57.780> let's<00:01:57.990> swing<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
around the perimeter so let's swing the

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.999 
around the perimeter so let's swing the
ball<00:01:58.520> one<00:01:59.520> goes<00:01:59.819> over<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.479> two<00:02:00.720> okay<00:02:01.380> how

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
ball one goes over to the two okay how

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.290 
ball one goes over to the two okay how
are<00:02:02.039> we<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> rotate<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
are we going to rotate here so what is

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.180 
are we going to rotate here so what is
our<00:02:03.509> two<00:02:03.780> player<00:02:04.050> now<00:02:04.289> in<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.800> it's<00:02:04.950> either

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
our two player now in so it's either

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.370 
our two player now in so it's either
going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> ball<00:02:06.300> position<00:02:06.869> denying

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
going to be ball position denying

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to be ball position denying
position<00:02:07.830> or<00:02:07.979> help<00:02:08.190> position<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:09.810> ball
