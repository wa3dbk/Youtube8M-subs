00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.270
 pizzi 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.830
 photo check 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.759
 is a dangerous player 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.160
 visits of the real also invested more in 2009 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.119
 in fact they were not identified 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.140
 for those who lost several orders 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.210
 if we win the race 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.590
 using whistles past honks people ask how 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.909
 but the situation has changed 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:27.910
 the time has come 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.999
 the defenders anderson marques 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.210
 everyone will have access to the site 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.030
 the passport 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.190
 to see the reconstruction of these cities 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.580
 although it is a very simple process 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.280
 it's not a thing if it were d 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.790
 figure out how you do not say so 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.960
 because the explosion it is made through the sum of two procedures the first 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.540
 that the atmospheric apparatus 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.660
 second kr 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.380
 the assimilation of the fire effect in this to take the explosion 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.870
 so let's start creating parati but it made eco 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.810
 we have to be a wide palette of creation here and click on this link in that 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 group that edits are dark is the price 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.050
 have made the drop-down menu that we want to have here, we have faith 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.670
 rats 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 let's create with 1 a rattle the despair 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.120
 it looks like you click here in the top view 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.200
 The river tourism is a ciliary object. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.900
 so much so that if we take this picture here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.320
 nothing looks like it needs the summit of some other object 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.280
 and that's what we're going to do now 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.460
 I heard in the modification palette 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.920
 and you see that down here we have vacations and effects we will click on 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 add 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 but let's cry a fire project 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.940
 we do not have any topic time 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 I selected fire effect I wanted to have fixed 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 so we'll have some crowther up 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.350
 what for 7 people 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.740
 Behind the settings here 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.480
 the rookie of xingÃ³ 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.319
 the regularity poles and counters 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
 the sisal plane drops to 15 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.489
 the density I go down to 5 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.679
 is that they do it in bethel I'm going to throw indirect 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.759
 number of 100 after 30 to 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.709
 I do not know if I'll put 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 yes yes at 15 it grows as 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.169
 fire year 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.959
 and audrey football boots 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.529
 at 20 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 that the most important thing is to mark an explosion here 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.109
 you can he is contact with botafogo marcio I will not leave with the 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.099
 smoke 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.169
 and let's go blast 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.629
 that is simply and miss duration of it I will have had frame 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:57.740
 10 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.740
 to table 80 for example because any 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.510
 we can then image Chicano frame 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.590
 20 25 and make a preview to see it as such 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.739
 we will see here the various facets position because it was progressive ne 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.339
 and you can not see her 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.349
 unless we laugh at the whole sequence 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.069
 the candidate begins to enter the field if it arises from smoke 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.179
 so we're going to surrender isabella 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.889
 because 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.889
 but then we will adopt to raise prou 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:47.199
 thriving sachs so that I go very important in the process they action 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.099
 you save with ralf dimensions looks like alfredo in the spans configurates said 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.099
 now I will click this icon to search the use panel 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.190
 I'll mark the current 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.560
 taram wants it all I'll just mark the entire 180 frames where the blast 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.599
 happens 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
 the county 640 by 480 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.109
 we will keystone you 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.429
 so we save 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:13.689
 I already left one 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.530
 a van 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.530
 reserved by medical staff mendes top 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.809
 few ahmad explosion 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.659
 I'm very important format 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.189
 criteria are can run any way because this year some way I think 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.719
 what 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.650
 I always like to thirst and save the fool. 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.490
 because I intended 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 I'm going to name it by explosion 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.449
 by clicking 6 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.909
 now said that it is very important 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.659
 I noticed here they have to score here the 24 48 bits I'm going to bounce 48 bitt 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.169
 attached to our best 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.759
 It's the most important thing that this exercise marked here had my alpha. 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.789
 you do not mark this you will have the black background instead of the transparency 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.120
 then click hockenheim 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.400
 ef 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.889
 everything is correct here 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.659
 I made sure I noticed perspectives have selected boucle 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.009
 Van 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.009
 and he will address on the court the court 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.710
 I'm going to break the fifth 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.090
 So we're back here, it's missing, I'm more of a frame than for 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.090
 accomplish 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.819
 I can then irritated the 3 sets to 2 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.919
 I'm going to import 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.919
 This sequence of days has gone wrong. 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.189
 click here select the first of the fronts 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.919
 Who felt that this squad must be consistent. 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.029
 this is it I will open the mouth is a new composition even with the latest 40 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.949
 by 480 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.949
 gotham duration lasts 20 seconds here 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.599
 that put you with a new floor 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.300
 Any color here just for us. 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.550
 it is 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.620
 check 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.620
 transparency in the background 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.180
 we will then bring the exhibition with the composition 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.759
 vote for yourself 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.759
 see only 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.279
 perfection that remained the transparency 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.279
 if I change here, I'll agree 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:38.809
 osorio 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.320
 Whatever color you are you see the transparency with which it holds 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:51.969
 so the idea without an accent gives you an exhibition with transparency to be 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.969
 used on television 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.039
 no time limits can be foreseen for 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.229
 foreign 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.710
 stronger and weaker functions 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.710
 the direction of the edict disassemble the correctness 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.389
 the data from August last year 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.499
 I think it was an honor to wear live productions 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:12.159
 the airplane design hugs
