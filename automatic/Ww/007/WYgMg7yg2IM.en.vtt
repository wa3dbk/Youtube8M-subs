00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
guys I'd like to see if we can aim for

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.490

300 plus likes and let's get straight
into<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.800> mod<00:00:43.949> so<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.699> essentially<00:00:45.089> does<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
into the mod so what essentially does is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.390 
into the mod so what essentially does is
if<00:00:46.019> I<00:00:46.170> go<00:00:46.320> ahead<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.010> throw<00:00:47.190> some

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
if I go ahead and I just throw some

if I go ahead and I just throw some
items<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.600> looks<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.410> different<00:00:49.440> as

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
items here it looks a lot different as

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.160 
items here it looks a lot different as
you<00:00:50.220> could<00:00:50.400> see<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> looks<00:00:50.970> like<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.690> sword<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you could see it looks like the sword is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.210 
you could see it looks like the sword is
just<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> laying<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> ground

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
just kind of laying on the ground

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.920 
just kind of laying on the ground
where's<00:00:53.489> before<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.149> would<00:00:54.300> rotate<00:00:54.570> around

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
where's before it would rotate around

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
where's before it would rotate around
and<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> standing<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.610> its

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and kind of just be standing up on its

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520 
and kind of just be standing up on its
own<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.989> chill<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.379> there

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
own and just kind of chill in there

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.979 
own and just kind of chill in there
whereas<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> laying<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.780> block

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
whereas here it is laying on the block

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
whereas here it is laying on the block
like<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> ground<00:01:01.649> realistically<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> way

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
like on the ground realistically the way

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.790 
like on the ground realistically the way
it<00:01:02.730> would<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.899> could<00:01:04.050> even<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.530> like

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
it would be and you could even see like

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.380 
it would be and you could even see like
once<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.280> thrown<00:01:05.520> or<00:01:05.729> dropped<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
once it's thrown or dropped it kind of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
once it's thrown or dropped it kind of
like<00:01:06.509> just<00:01:06.690> flings<00:01:07.200> around<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.160> kind<00:01:08.399> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
like just flings around and it kind of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.430 
like just flings around and it kind of
just<00:01:08.640> looks<00:01:08.910> more<00:01:09.000> realistic<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.020> kill<00:01:10.289> the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
just looks more realistic if I kill the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.410 
just looks more realistic if I kill the
skeleton<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.039> which<00:01:11.460> I'll<00:01:11.670> let<00:01:11.910> them<00:01:12.119> fire

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
skeleton here which I'll let them fire

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
skeleton here which I'll let them fire
kill<00:01:12.750> him<00:01:12.899> real<00:01:13.050> quick<00:01:13.170> you'll<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.619> he

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
kill him real quick you'll see when he

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.529 
kill him real quick you'll see when he
chops<00:01:13.950> his<00:01:14.610> items<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.179> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.509> straight

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
chops his items just kind of go straight

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.510 
chops his items just kind of go straight
to<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.050> ground<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.280> chills

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to the ground and it kind of just chills

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.770 
to the ground and it kind of just chills
here<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.940> effects<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.360> couple<00:01:18.630> other

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
here but it effects a couple other

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
here but it effects a couple other
things<00:01:19.050> as<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.410> we<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> water<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.910> lava

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
things as well we have a water and lava

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
things as well we have a water and lava
here<00:01:21.390> which<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.660> are<00:01:21.990> pretty<00:01:22.259> essential<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
here which are are pretty essential to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
here which are are pretty essential to
the<00:01:22.890> mod<00:01:23.070> previously<00:01:23.910> anything<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> put

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the mod previously anything that you put

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.419 
the mod previously anything that you put
in<00:01:24.960> water<00:01:25.259> would<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.560> sink<00:01:25.979> straight<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
in water would just sink straight to the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.699 
in water would just sink straight to the
bottom<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:26.849> now<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.300> you<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:28.110> light<00:01:28.349> item

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
bottom but now if you take a light item

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.440 
bottom but now if you take a light item
and<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> throw<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.459> it'll<00:01:29.880> sink<00:01:30.060> straight

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and you throw it in it'll sink straight

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.029 
and you throw it in it'll sink straight
it'll<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.840> straight<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.289> top<00:01:31.470> rather<00:01:31.709> and

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
it'll go straight to the top rather and

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.620 
it'll go straight to the top rather and
that<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.789> float<00:01:33.119> around<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.539> now

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that kind of just float around and now

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.540 
that kind of just float around and now
it<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:33.929> of<00:01:34.050> spins<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.800> rotates<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.340> stands

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
it kind of spins and rotates and stands

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.430 
it kind of spins and rotates and stands
up<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.849> its<00:01:36.060> own<00:01:36.179> but<00:01:36.660> it's<00:01:36.810> realistic<00:01:37.080> has

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
up on its own but it's realistic has

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.740 
up on its own but it's realistic has
light<00:01:37.649> stuff<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.280> float<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.849> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.420> just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
light stuff would float or you know just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.809 
light stuff would float or you know just
things<00:01:40.289> are<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.470> guess<00:01:40.890> less<00:01:41.250> dense<00:01:41.550> in<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
things are I guess less dense in the

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.609 
things are I guess less dense in the
water<00:01:42.000> would<00:01:42.300> float<00:01:42.989> so<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.349> take<00:01:43.470> all

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
water would float so if we take all

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.229 
water would float so if we take all
these<00:01:43.770> light<00:01:43.979> items<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.580> we<00:01:44.640> throw<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:45.239 
these light items and we throw them in

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.430 
these light items and we throw them in
here<00:01:45.390> they'll<00:01:45.599> float<00:01:45.750> let's<00:01:45.989> see<00:01:46.080> if<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> bow

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
here they'll float let's see if the bow

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.620 
here they'll float let's see if the bow
floats<00:01:46.830> even<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.640> bloat<00:01:47.849> the<00:01:48.060> bow<00:01:48.209> floats

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
floats even the bloat the bow floats

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.059 
floats even the bloat the bow floats
let's<00:01:48.929> see<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> sword<00:01:49.649> floats<00:01:49.920> I'd

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
let's see if the sword floats I'd

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.710 
let's see if the sword floats I'd
imagine<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.429> would<00:01:50.610> sink<00:01:50.849> open<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.509> by<00:01:51.660> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
imagine that would sink open up by the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.180 
imagine that would sink open up by the
sword<00:01:52.020> actually<00:01:52.349> sinks<00:01:52.679> that<00:01:52.770> looks<00:01:52.950> really

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
sword actually sinks that looks really

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.169 
sword actually sinks that looks really
cool<00:01:53.459> though<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.789> lot<00:01:53.910> better<00:01:54.060> than

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
cool though it's a lot better than

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.089 
cool though it's a lot better than
everything<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.380> being<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.619> burden<00:01:55.830> and

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
everything just just being a burden and

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.320 
everything just just being a burden and
sinking<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.610> bottom<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.239> to

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
sinking to the bottom then you have to

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.180 
sinking to the bottom then you have to
go<00:01:57.450> swim<00:01:57.690> down<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.050> get<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.349> but<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.709> you<00:01:59.009> do

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
go swim down and get it but if you do

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.359 
go swim down and get it but if you do
take<00:01:59.369> heavy<00:01:59.610> items<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.239> stone<00:02:00.660> or<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.250> know

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
take heavy items like stone or you know

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.130 
take heavy items like stone or you know
anvils<00:02:02.970> things<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.509> sort<00:02:03.569> they<00:02:03.959> will

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
anvils things of that sort they will

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.930 
anvils things of that sort they will
sink<00:02:04.440> down<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.830> think<00:02:05.069> it's<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:05.369> helping<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
sink down I think it's not helping that

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.059 
sink down I think it's not helping that
the<00:02:06.509> water<00:02:06.780> flow<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.530> screwed<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.890> let

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the water flow is kind of screwed up let

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
the water flow is kind of screwed up let
me<00:02:08.099> fix<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> real<00:02:08.819> quick<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.300> we'll

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
me fix that real quick and we'll

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.479 
me fix that real quick and we'll
actually<00:02:10.200> try<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.890> again<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.250> let's<00:02:11.370> go

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
actually try that again so let's go

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.619 
actually try that again so let's go
ahead<00:02:11.640> we'll<00:02:11.730> throw<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> anvil<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> see

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
ahead we'll throw the anvil and you see

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.880 
ahead we'll throw the anvil and you see
the<00:02:12.720> anvil<00:02:13.080> will<00:02:13.200> sink<00:02:13.440> straight<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the anvil will sink straight to the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.210 
the anvil will sink straight to the
bottom<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.970> bow<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.319> bow<00:02:16.440> floats<00:02:16.770> okay

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
bottom the bow up the bow floats okay

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070 
bottom the bow up the bow floats okay
where'd<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.580> sword<00:02:17.819> go<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.239> here's<00:02:18.690> my<00:02:18.840> sword

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
where'd my sword go I here's my sword

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.199 
where'd my sword go I here's my sword
let's<00:02:19.260> see<00:02:19.379> if<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.370> sword<00:02:20.610> actually<00:02:20.970> floats

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
let's see if the sword actually floats

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.050 
let's see if the sword actually floats
the<00:02:21.330> arrow<00:02:21.510> floats<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.830> sword<00:02:23.160> does<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> flow

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the arrow floats the sword does a flow

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.920 
the arrow floats the sword does a flow
as<00:02:24.239> well<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.860> anvil<00:02:26.250> doesn't<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.629> stone

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
as well the anvil doesn't and the stone

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.740 
as well the anvil doesn't and the stone
wall<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.200> wood<00:02:28.560> wood<00:02:28.950> should<00:02:29.190> float<00:02:29.750> alright

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
wall and wood wood should float alright

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.599 
wall and wood wood should float alright
what<00:02:31.049> floats<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:31.500> heavy<00:02:31.859> things<00:02:32.189> pretty<00:02:32.459> much

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
what floats so heavy things pretty much

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.039 
what floats so heavy things pretty much
are<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.209> sink<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.569> bottom<00:02:33.599> and

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
are going to sink to the bottom and

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:34.570 
are going to sink to the bottom and
think

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
think

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.070 
think
aren't<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:34.970> heavier<00:02:35.270> gonna<00:02:35.510> float<00:02:35.750> up<00:02:35.900> to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
aren't that heavier gonna float up to

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.540 
aren't that heavier gonna float up to
the<00:02:36.170> top<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:36.530> it's<00:02:36.650> kind<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.890> realistic<00:02:37.160> there

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
the top so it's kind of realistic there

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.910 
the top so it's kind of realistic there
in<00:02:38.180> some<00:02:38.480> senses<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.110> we<00:02:39.170> also<00:02:39.380> have<00:02:39.650> lava

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
in some senses and we also have lava

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.650 
in some senses and we also have lava
here<00:02:40.220> whereas<00:02:40.550> before<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.150> something<00:02:41.540> went

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
here whereas before if something went

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.500 
here whereas before if something went
into<00:02:41.750> lava<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:43.280> would<00:02:43.520> just<00:02:43.700> immediately<00:02:44.000> burn

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
into lava it would just immediately burn

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.880 
into lava it would just immediately burn
there'd<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:44.870> no<00:02:45.020> chance<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.590> get<00:02:45.770> in

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
there'd be no chance of you get in

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.960 
there'd be no chance of you get in
anything<00:02:46.130> now<00:02:46.400> if<00:02:46.490> you<00:02:46.550> get<00:02:46.670> like<00:02:46.760> fire

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
anything now if you get like fire

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.790 
anything now if you get like fire
resistance<00:02:47.390> potions<00:02:47.870> or<00:02:48.320> anything<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.710> that

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
resistance potions or anything like that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.410 
resistance potions or anything like that
or<00:02:49.010> you're<00:02:49.130> feeling<00:02:49.460> that<00:02:49.670> kind<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.090> risky<00:02:50.330> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
or you're feeling that kind of risky you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.700 
or you're feeling that kind of risky you
have<00:02:50.510> some<00:02:50.660> Opie<00:02:50.930> armor<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.380> could<00:02:51.530> kind

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
have some Opie armor and you could kind

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.440 
have some Opie armor and you could kind
of<00:02:51.830> soak<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.190> damage<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.880> could<00:02:52.970> actually<00:02:53.150> go

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
of soak up damage you could actually go

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.760 
of soak up damage you could actually go
in<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.720> lava<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.080> get<00:02:54.260> your<00:02:54.380> items<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.740> let's

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
in the lava and get your items so let's

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.410 
in the lava and get your items so let's
say<00:02:55.070> an<00:02:55.190> or<00:02:55.400> Falls<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.940> there<00:02:56.030> such<00:02:56.240> as

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
say an or Falls and there such as

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.420 
say an or Falls and there such as
diamond<00:02:56.990> I'll<00:02:57.320> go<00:02:57.470> ahead<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.860> I'll<00:02:57.950> grab<00:02:58.190> some

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
diamond I'll go ahead and I'll grab some

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.070 
diamond I'll go ahead and I'll grab some
diamond<00:02:58.790> ore<00:02:58.940> we'll<00:02:59.180> go<00:02:59.660> ahead<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.930> throw

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
diamond ore we'll go ahead and throw

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.020 
diamond ore we'll go ahead and throw
that<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.410> there<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:00.620> let's<00:03:01.160> say<00:03:01.400> you're<00:03:01.760> mining

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
that in there so let's say you're mining

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.630 
that in there so let's say you're mining
some<00:03:02.120> diamond<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.840> falls<00:03:03.200> into<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.070> lava

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
some diamond and it falls into the lava

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.940 
some diamond and it falls into the lava
we<00:03:04.970> could<00:03:05.180> now<00:03:05.330> go<00:03:05.660> in<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.290> we<00:03:06.620> could<00:03:06.770> pick

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
we could now go in it and we could pick

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.040 
we could now go in it and we could pick
it<00:03:06.980> up<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.340> don't<00:03:07.520> know<00:03:07.580> why<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.720> has<00:03:08.900> like

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
it up and I don't know why it has like

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.410 
it up and I don't know why it has like
the<00:03:09.200> same<00:03:09.610> mechanism<00:03:10.610> as<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.790> water<00:03:11.120> where

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
the same mechanism as the water where

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.240 
the same mechanism as the water where
things<00:03:11.690> seem<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.930> float<00:03:12.620> light<00:03:12.860> things<00:03:13.070> seem

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
things seem to float light things seem

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.800 
things seem to float light things seem
to<00:03:13.280> float<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:13.790> if<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:13.970> if<00:03:14.240> I<00:03:14.390> throw<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> like

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
to float so if I if I throw a like

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.060 
to float so if I if I throw a like
something<00:03:15.050> like<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.650> seems<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:15.950> be

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
something like this it seems to be

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.870 
something like this it seems to be
floating<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.340> don't<00:03:16.459> know<00:03:16.520> if<00:03:16.610> that's<00:03:16.760> like<00:03:16.820> a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
floating I don't know if that's like a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.010 
floating I don't know if that's like a
bug<00:03:17.180> or<00:03:17.360> if<00:03:17.480> that's<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.750> way<00:03:17.870> it's<00:03:17.990> supposed

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
bug or if that's the way it's supposed

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.660 
bug or if that's the way it's supposed
to<00:03:18.350> be<00:03:18.530> with<00:03:18.830> things<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.220> don't<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.520> don't<00:03:19.580> think

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
to be with things I don't I don't think

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.670 
to be with things I don't I don't think
things<00:03:20.000> would<00:03:20.180> really<00:03:20.360> flow<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.990> lava<00:03:21.470> like

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
things would really flow in a lava like

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680 
things would really flow in a lava like
that<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:21.860> think<00:03:22.040> they'd<00:03:22.130> catch<00:03:22.640> on<00:03:22.820> fire<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:23.360> if

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
that I think they'd catch on fire but if

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.210 
that I think they'd catch on fire but if
I<00:03:23.780> throw<00:03:23.959> something<00:03:24.410> like<00:03:24.440> wood<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.070> there

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
I throw something like wood in there

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.190 
I throw something like wood in there
it'll<00:03:25.400> still<00:03:25.730> burn<00:03:25.970> immediately<00:03:26.930> but<00:03:27.110> the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
it'll still burn immediately but the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.900 
it'll still burn immediately but the
only<00:03:27.350> things<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.890> burn<00:03:28.160> aren't<00:03:28.550> even

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
only things that burn aren't even

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.570 
only things that burn aren't even
flammable<00:03:29.570> things<00:03:29.780> or<00:03:29.959> just<00:03:29.990> things<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.410> you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
flammable things or just things that you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.770 
flammable things or just things that you
would<00:03:31.580> put<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.970> furnace<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:32.360> if<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.600> take

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
would put in a furnace so if I take

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.620 
would put in a furnace so if I take
something<00:03:33.050> flammable<00:03:33.500> let's<00:03:34.190> say<00:03:34.630> something

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
something flammable let's say something

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.530 
something flammable let's say something
that's<00:03:35.780> flammable<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.650> rail<00:03:37.280> okay<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:37.970> rail<00:03:38.300> this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that's flammable a rail okay a rail this

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.120 
that's flammable a rail okay a rail this
would<00:03:38.720> totally<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.230> flammable<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.920> would

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
would totally be flammable that would

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.030 
would totally be flammable that would
burn<00:03:40.760> immediately<00:03:41.630> but<00:03:42.320> if<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.590> throw<00:03:42.739> that<00:03:42.920> in

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
burn immediately but if I throw that in

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.130 
burn immediately but if I throw that in
the<00:03:43.130> lava<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.670> will<00:03:43.820> not<00:03:44.000> burn<00:03:44.300> which<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.810> it's

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
the lava it will not burn which is it's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.449 
the lava it will not burn which is it's
kind<00:03:45.350> of<00:03:45.410> weird<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.680> only<00:03:45.800> works<00:03:46.100> for<00:03:46.250> things

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
kind of weird it only works for things

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.710 
kind of weird it only works for things
that<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.700> put<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.150> furnace<00:03:47.450> which<00:03:47.600> I

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
that you put in the furnace which I

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.120 
that you put in the furnace which I
guess<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.019> makes<00:03:48.170> sense<00:03:48.350> but<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.709> not<00:03:48.920> really

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
guess it makes sense but it's not really

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.280 
guess it makes sense but it's not really
realistic<00:03:49.370> in<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.760> sense<00:03:50.000> like<00:03:50.480> let's<00:03:51.140> say<00:03:51.260> I

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
realistic in the sense like let's say I

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.840 
realistic in the sense like let's say I
throw<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.650> bow<00:03:51.860> which<00:03:52.100> would<00:03:52.310> totally<00:03:52.670> just

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
throw this bow which would totally just

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.910 
throw this bow which would totally just
burn<00:03:53.030> up<00:03:53.150> immediately<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.350> a-okay<00:03:54.800> and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
burn up immediately and it's a-okay and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.229 
burn up immediately and it's a-okay and
I<00:03:54.950> could<00:03:55.130> kind<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.400> just<00:03:55.459> go<00:03:55.610> back<00:03:55.880> like<00:03:56.090> it's

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
I could kind of just go back like it's

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.600 
I could kind of just go back like it's
some<00:03:56.420> some<00:03:56.840> sort<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.170> majestic<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.860> power<00:03:58.070> from

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
some some sort of majestic of power from

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.610 
some some sort of majestic of power from
the<00:03:58.760> bow<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.600> another<00:03:59.989> cool<00:04:00.260> little<00:04:00.500> neat

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the bow so another cool little neat

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.020 
the bow so another cool little neat
feature<00:04:00.860> on<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.280> model<00:04:01.550> let's<00:04:01.610> go<00:04:01.760> ahead<00:04:01.820> and

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
feature on this model let's go ahead and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.240 
feature on this model let's go ahead and
we'll<00:04:02.090> go<00:04:02.269> off<00:04:03.019> this<00:04:03.320> mountaintop<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:04.010> if<00:04:04.130> we

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
we'll go off this mountaintop is if we

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.890 
we'll go off this mountaintop is if we
throw<00:04:04.489> things<00:04:04.790> there's<00:04:05.150> like<00:04:05.330> cool<00:04:05.540> physics

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
throw things there's like cool physics

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.900 
throw things there's like cool physics
while<00:04:06.050> it's<00:04:06.650> falling<00:04:06.830> it'll<00:04:07.370> kind<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.700> spin

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
while it's falling it'll kind of spin

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.790 
while it's falling it'll kind of spin
around<00:04:08.209> rather<00:04:08.840> than<00:04:09.170> just<00:04:09.410> like<00:04:09.500> fall

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
around rather than just like fall

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.050 
around rather than just like fall
straight<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.340> let's<00:04:10.489> just<00:04:10.640> go<00:04:10.760> ahead<00:04:10.850> we'll

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
straight so let's just go ahead we'll

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.040 
straight so let's just go ahead we'll
throw<00:04:11.239> a<00:04:11.269> little<00:04:11.420> bunch<00:04:11.570> of<00:04:11.690> things<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:11.989> you

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
throw a little bunch of things and you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.660 
throw a little bunch of things and you
could<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.320> kind<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.620> see<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:12.830> just<00:04:13.010> kind<00:04:13.610> of

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
could just kind of see it just kind of

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.979 
could just kind of see it just kind of
just<00:04:13.880> keep<00:04:14.030> spinning<00:04:14.209> around<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.900> going

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
just keep spinning around and going

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.599 
just keep spinning around and going
around<00:04:15.260> as<00:04:15.620> it's<00:04:15.800> falling<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.220> kind<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.459> looks

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
around as it's falling it kind of looks

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.009 
around as it's falling it kind of looks
hysterical<00:04:17.090> with<00:04:17.239> all<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:17.479> stuff<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.780> want<00:04:17.959> to

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
hysterical with all this stuff I want to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.870 
hysterical with all this stuff I want to
throw<00:04:18.229> my<00:04:18.350> helmet

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
throw my helmet

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
throw my helmet
alright<00:04:19.880> I'm<00:04:20.060> happy<00:04:20.330> not<00:04:20.419> through<00:04:20.660> my<00:04:20.750> helmet

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
alright I'm happy not through my helmet

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.810 
alright I'm happy not through my helmet
but<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:21.680> throw<00:04:21.859> spawn<00:04:22.130> eggs<00:04:22.340> are<00:04:22.490> effective

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
but we throw spawn eggs are effective

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.730 
but we throw spawn eggs are effective
every<00:04:23.030> item<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.419> basically<00:04:23.720> effect<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:24.229> if

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
every item is basically effect that if

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.830 
every item is basically effect that if
it's<00:04:24.979> like<00:04:25.100> a<00:04:25.130> drop<00:04:25.460> or<00:04:25.700> if<00:04:25.760> it's<00:04:25.910> thrown<00:04:26.510> and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
it's like a drop or if it's thrown and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.270 
it's like a drop or if it's thrown and
as<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.080> can<00:04:27.200> see<00:04:27.260> there's<00:04:27.620> no<00:04:27.770> consistent

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
as you can see there's no consistent

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.550 
as you can see there's no consistent
pattern<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.760> just<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.510> know<00:04:29.630> wherever<00:04:30.260> the

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
pattern it just you know wherever the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.680 
pattern it just you know wherever the
physics<00:04:30.950> basically<00:04:31.430> takes<00:04:31.669> it<00:04:31.880> whatever<00:04:32.419> you

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
physics basically takes it whatever you

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.570 
physics basically takes it whatever you
know<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.290> velocity<00:04:33.800> or<00:04:33.919> anything<00:04:34.280> like<00:04:34.520> that

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
know the velocity or anything like that

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.659 
know the velocity or anything like that
like<00:04:34.930> momentum<00:04:35.930> rather<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.250> black<00:04:37.460> where

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
like momentum rather of the black where

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.340 
like momentum rather of the black where
would<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.210> where<00:04:38.419> it's<00:04:38.570> going<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.930> flip<00:04:39.140> and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
would go is where it's going to flip and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.320 
would go is where it's going to flip and
fall<00:04:39.800> over<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.669> like<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.030> I

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
fall over so I really like that I

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.550 
fall over so I really like that I
actually<00:04:41.570> took<00:04:41.810> physics<00:04:42.140> in<00:04:42.229> high<00:04:42.290> school<00:04:42.530> I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
actually took physics in high school I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.380 
actually took physics in high school I
wasn't<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.830> best<00:04:43.039> at<00:04:43.190> it<00:04:43.220> but<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:43.940> really<00:04:44.240> like

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
wasn't the best at it but I really like

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.880 
wasn't the best at it but I really like
this<00:04:44.570> for<00:04:44.750> Minecraft<00:04:45.200> I<00:04:45.320> think<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.770> nice

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
this for Minecraft I think it's a nice

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.330 
this for Minecraft I think it's a nice
little<00:04:46.190> addition<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.729> definitely

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
little addition it definitely

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
little addition it definitely
makes<00:04:47.430> things<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.730> little<00:04:47.850> bit<00:04:48.060> more<00:04:48.210> realistic

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
makes things a little bit more realistic

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.480 
makes things a little bit more realistic
a<00:04:48.780> lot<00:04:48.960> more<00:04:49.230> emerging<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.190> it's<00:04:50.340> like<00:04:50.460> a

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
a lot more emerging and it's like a

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.340 
a lot more emerging and it's like a
small<00:04:50.790> basic<00:04:51.180> mod<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.810> good<00:04:51.990> mod<00:04:52.139> to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
small basic mod but it's a good mod to

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.080 
small basic mod but it's a good mod to
play<00:04:52.560> nonetheless<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.370> that's<00:04:53.790> pretty<00:04:53.910> much

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
play nonetheless so that's pretty much

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.340 
play nonetheless so that's pretty much
gonna<00:04:54.240> wrap<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.570> up<00:04:54.660> for<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:54.900> mod<00:04:55.080> guys<00:04:55.110> i

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
gonna wrap it up for this mod guys i

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.170 
gonna wrap it up for this mod guys i
