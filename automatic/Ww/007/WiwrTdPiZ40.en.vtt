00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.130
 Y 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 hello friends I hope you are very 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.840
 well welcome again your channel 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.120
 stop and well this time 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.940
 I come to teach 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.350
 it is called block box launcher but 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.530
 more than a lounge and I would tell you that it is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.600
 as a multitasking but more than anything else 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.059
 a multitask an application that we 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.190
 therefore allows direct accesses to 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.839
 other applications ok 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.550
 this application is free it puts it 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.110
 work from the Pleistocene a 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.729
 problem the name know that I leave it 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.070
 in the description of the video as always 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.019
 huge blogs box lunch totally 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.869
 free for all of you because there are 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.630
 once you download it then we 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.350
 is going to come out this icon I will bring a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.330
 little bit 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.870
 s above 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.350
 what cloudbox says 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.090
 I think if you can see this we're going to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.520
 come out that is like a little hand you 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.859
 they are going to enter the application 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.390
 and well I can not explain is a little 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.390
 taught before which is what we 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.200
 it brings ok first that nothing is going to give 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.880
 here in home 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.990
 this is how you will receive them 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.719
 is going to welcome and you are going 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.869
 serving to install in blogs box and 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.369
 everything not for blog boxes and I'm going to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.340
 explain this first and we're going to the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.189
 application that we have here then we have 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.959
 home a the content of the bar that 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.000
 I'm going to explain to you what but that 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.219
 explain this the content of the bar 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.950
 is what applications do we want them to be 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.380
 then for shortcuts or change 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.149
 until the application is as I say 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.319
 it is not a multitasking of its own because it does not 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.390
 we can be changing the 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.130
 applications that we have open but 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.920
 that we are going to add the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.420
 applications that we want to use 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.459
 as shortcuts or that you are going 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.560
 to go the ones that you want too 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.650
 can help to add folder if so 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.650
 I prefer the truth not 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.810
 and from there they have the black list that then 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.360
 is the blacklist but that does not have a 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.650
 utility the configuration that is for 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.329
 that you put where you are going to start 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.060
 glow box and where will you end up 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.150
 right now we'll talk about that here he says 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.609
 that if we want to unlock the version 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.500
 premium to have all the 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.950
 configurations but the truth I do not me 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.359
 I do not recommend that you buy it because 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.579
 because it is that the truth is free 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.590
 offers everything and then we do not have to pay 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.420
 nothing then the premium because the truth 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.239
 it is not very convenient but if you 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.590
 they want this download the in the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.560
 decision of the video I tell them how to have it 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.379
 for free or equal they can 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.160
 Buy it as you prefer ok 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.250
 well let's go explaining 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.680
 hence we have the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.190
 customization we can put the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.260
 opacity of the bar in the space of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.880
 the five that will occupy each one and 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.370
 the subject in this case I have the theme d 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.430
 for example that system the default the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.560
 that I'm not by default more or less 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.770
 can you see how they work or how 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 it looks 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.540
 for example I'm going to put the theme brings 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.770
 several preloaded topics and then I 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.110
 It seems that they are the only ones but here 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.760
 we have the option to go to the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.040
 editor to the editor icon i'm going to put 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.690
 that of ubuntu and good once 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.790
 we explain this let's proceed to 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.800
 show them how we work 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.820
 we find in our after in 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.980
 any part can not be a 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.920
 application or on a desk we 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.560
 if you guys realized my blog box 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.600
 start here as you see there you move 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.860
 a bar this bar that allows us 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.160
 here are the applications that I 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 I added if I release the button in a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.730
 will redirect to settings I put back 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.250
 to activate the bar I'm going to multimedia and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.530
 it automatically takes me to multimedia 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.930
 The truth is that it is a very 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.730
 simple but let me tell you that it is 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.829
 very fast that is the change between 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.350
 applications is very very fast and very 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.420
 efficient that's why this application has 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.830
 liked as well as how harmful I have 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.430
 the free version because the version 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.200
 pay no no wonder and the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.300
 The truth is not useful for the 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.910
 same then friends that was what 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.180
 I wanted to show you today 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.370
 I hope you liked this little 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.080
 this little short video where they 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.540
 I explain about this little application from 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.800
 small change and then also for 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.830
 example here have truth or button 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.890
 home if I leave it there send me to me 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.180
 Desktop leave two friends when 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.070
 moved asking them to have an excellent 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.870
 day that they spend it very nice and we 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.590
 we see in a next video has been given 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.590
 until next time
