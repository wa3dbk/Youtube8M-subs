hi<00:00:00.659> my<00:00:01.079> name<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.290> Andy<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.939> want<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.210> try<00:00:03.360> to

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hi my name is Andy and I want to try to

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.510 
hi my name is Andy and I want to try to
do<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.750> these<00:00:03.870> videos<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.350> show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.950> something

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
do in these videos is show you something

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.140 
do in these videos is show you something
that<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.970> don't<00:00:06.000> necessarily<00:00:06.569> see<00:00:07.170> every<00:00:07.770> day

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
that you don't necessarily see every day

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.470 
that you don't necessarily see every day
this<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.360> little<00:00:09.599> area<00:00:09.769> that<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> made<00:00:11.480> when

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
this is a little area that I made when

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.070 
this is a little area that I made when
this<00:00:13.170> area<00:00:13.650> converted<00:00:14.400> over<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:15.059> digital<00:00:15.450> TV

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
this area converted over to digital TV

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.849 
this area converted over to digital TV
and<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.449> actual<00:00:18.750> transmitting<00:00:19.380> station

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and the the actual transmitting station

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.029 
and the the actual transmitting station
is<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> bay<00:00:20.880> there<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.769> line

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
is just over the bay there so it's line

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.560 
is just over the bay there so it's line
of<00:00:23.220> sight<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.939> area<00:00:24.300> would<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
of sight so little area would be

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.920 
of sight so little area would be
perfectly<00:00:25.529> adequate<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.900> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
perfectly adequate and this is what I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
perfectly adequate and this is what I
made<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> bits<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> pieces<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
made so it's out of bits and pieces and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.370 
made so it's out of bits and pieces and
I've<00:00:30.750> cannibalize<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.980> other<00:00:32.969> aerials<00:00:33.719> but

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
I've cannibalize from other aerials but

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.520 
I've cannibalize from other aerials but
I<00:00:34.410> needed<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.829> base<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:36.390> make<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.870> aerial<00:00:37.320> art

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
I needed a base to make the aerial art

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.979 
I needed a base to make the aerial art
and<00:00:37.770> stop<00:00:38.100> him<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.550> wandering<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and stop him to wandering around so it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.110 
and stop him to wandering around so it
sort<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> stays<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:41.040> bearer<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.579> stays

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
sort of stays in put bearer that stays

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.630 
sort of stays in put bearer that stays
put<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> point<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.250> actually

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
put where I point it but it's actually

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
put where I point it but it's actually
the<00:00:44.760> base<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> talk<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.550> how

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the base I want to talk to you about how

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
the base I want to talk to you about how
this<00:00:47.760> base<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.360> actually<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> capacitor<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
this base is actually a capacitor and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.910 
this base is actually a capacitor and
it's<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.780> special<00:00:52.170> capacitor

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it's it's a bit of a special capacitor

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's it's a bit of a special capacitor
it's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.270> high<00:00:54.750> frequency<00:00:56.539> induction<00:00:57.539> heating

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it's a high frequency induction heating

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.420 
it's a high frequency induction heating
capacitor<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:58.980> least<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
capacitor or at least that's the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.799 
capacitor or at least that's the
application<00:00:59.690> that<00:01:00.690> I've<00:01:00.870> used<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.829> for

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
application that I've used and for

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
application that I've used and for
designed<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.049> developed<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:05.280> extremely

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
designed and developed by an extremely

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 
designed and developed by an extremely
clever<00:01:06.119> man<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.110> called

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
clever man that I know called

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.109 
clever man that I know called
albert<00:01:08.340> jakku<00:01:08.760> village<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.880> one

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
albert jakku village and this is at one

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.190 
albert jakku village and this is at one
point<00:01:12.390> 2<00:01:12.750> micro<00:01:13.409> farad<00:01:14.479> 500<00:01:15.479> volt<00:01:15.720> capacitor

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
point 2 micro farad 500 volt capacitor

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.580 
point 2 micro farad 500 volt capacitor
and<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:18.240> has<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:19.250> current<00:01:20.250> rating<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.200> 500<00:01:22.200> amps

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and it has a current rating of 500 amps

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.240 
and it has a current rating of 500 amps
so<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.200> lot<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.439> current<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so that's that's a lot of current and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.730 
so that's that's a lot of current and
I've<00:01:27.150> used<00:01:27.420> capacitors<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.579> banks

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
I've used capacitors like this in banks

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.450 
I've used capacitors like this in banks
to<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> desired<00:01:33.360> k<00:01:34.110> VA<00:01:34.350> rating<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.430> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to get the desired k VA rating that I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.969 
to get the desired k VA rating that I
needed<00:01:36.770> they<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.159> mounted<00:01:38.640> with

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
needed they have to be mounted with

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.190 
needed they have to be mounted with
special<00:01:40.979> attention<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> busbar

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
special attention to the busbar

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.350 
special attention to the busbar
arrangements<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.610> as<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.820> our<00:01:44.939> water

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
arrangements and as all our water

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.590 
arrangements and as all our water
cooling<00:01:45.930> involved<00:01:46.670> blender<00:01:47.670> anyway<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.329> just

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
cooling involved blender anyway I just

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
cooling involved blender anyway I just
thought<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.079> maybe<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> sort<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
thought that maybe that's the sort of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
thought that maybe that's the sort of
thing<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> may<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.899> seen<00:01:52.170> before

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
thing that you may not have seen before

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.670 
thing that you may not have seen before
and<00:01:52.890> I'm<00:01:53.820> sure<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.479> look<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:56.509> SLM

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
and I'm sure if you look at the SLM

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
and I'm sure if you look at the SLM
website<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.420> company<00:02:00.420> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
website that's the company that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.139 
website that's the company that
manufactures<00:02:01.350> them<00:02:01.729> you'll<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.939> some

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
manufactures them you'll see some

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.800 
manufactures them you'll see some
interesting<00:02:04.040> specifications<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.810> some

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
interesting specifications on some

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.190 
interesting specifications on some
serious<00:02:07.590> capacitors<00:02:08.810> anyway<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> hope<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
serious capacitors anyway I hope you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.680 
serious capacitors anyway I hope you
found<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.590> interesting<00:02:11.569> thanks<00:02:12.569> for

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
found that interesting thanks for

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.550 
found that interesting thanks for
watching

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
