00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.620 

tonight<00:01:29.810> here<00:01:30.460> then<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.820> move<00:01:32.030> your<00:01:32.060> queen<00:01:32.360> up

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
to here but that is rather obvious that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160 
to here but that is rather obvious that
you're<00:01:37.340> planning<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.790> checkmate<00:01:38.210> or<00:01:38.420> something

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
you're planning a checkmate or something

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.640 
you're planning a checkmate or something
that<00:01:39.890> will<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.340> affected<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.870> usually<00:01:42.470> move

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that will be affected so I usually move

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.330 
that will be affected so I usually move
my<00:01:42.890> queen<00:01:43.340> up<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.610> here<00:01:44.350> let's<00:01:45.350> say<00:01:45.680> they<00:01:46.130> move

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
my queen up to here let's say they move

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.240 
my queen up to here let's say they move
dirt<00:01:46.700> Bishop<00:01:47.060> over<00:01:47.270> here<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:48.620> final<00:01:48.860> move

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
dirt Bishop over here the final move

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.610 
dirt Bishop over here the final move
will<00:01:49.550> be<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:50.000> Queen<00:01:50.300> capturing<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:51.350> pawn

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
will be the Queen capturing this pawn

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.730 
will be the Queen capturing this pawn
once<00:01:51.890> more<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.840> will<00:01:53.960> check<00:01:54.200> mate<00:01:54.470> with

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
once more and it will check mate with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
once more and it will check mate with
the<00:01:55.010> Queen<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:56.390> bishop<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:58.130> final<00:01:58.550> move

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
the Queen and the bishop the final move

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.420 
the Queen and the bishop the final move
is<00:01:59.110> I'm<00:02:00.110> pretty<00:02:00.320> sure<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:00.950> called<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
is I'm pretty sure it is called the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.240 
is I'm pretty sure it is called the
fried<00:02:01.640> liver<00:02:01.850> attack<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.770> uses<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
fried liver attack and this uses the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.580 
fried liver attack and this uses the
night<00:02:04.610> ended<00:02:05.090> up<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.750> capture<00:02:06.440> your

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
night ended up to capture your

night ended up to capture your
opponent's<00:02:06.710> Queen<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> first<00:02:13.480> you'll<00:02:14.480> be

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
opponent's Queen so first you'll be

knight<00:02:53.870> up<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.739> now<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.920> forking

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
knight up to here now this is forking

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.360 
knight up to here now this is forking
both<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.090> rook<00:02:59.269> and<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.540> Queen<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:01.070> and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
both the rook and the Queen so that and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.009 
both the rook and the Queen so that and
the<00:03:01.820> King<00:03:02.030> cannot<00:03:02.360> capture<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.840> night

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
the King cannot capture the night

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.580 
the King cannot capture the night
because<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.769> bishop<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:05.049> not<00:03:06.049> allowing<00:03:06.530> that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
because the bishop is not allowing that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.500 
because the bishop is not allowing that

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
so when you scale the Queen and the rook

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.050 
so when you scale the Queen and the rook
on<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.110> scale<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.739> say<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.340> Queen<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.790> more
