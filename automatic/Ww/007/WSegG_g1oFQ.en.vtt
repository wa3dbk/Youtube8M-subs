talking about a supplement called side
away<00:00:07.410> iceland<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.189> actually<00:00:08.550> produced

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
away iceland this is actually produced

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:19.340 
away iceland this is actually produced
by<00:00:09.179> Cytosport<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:18.210> side<00:00:18.420> away<00:00:18.570> isolate<00:00:19.170> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
by Cytosport the side away isolate is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.800 
by Cytosport the side away isolate is
not<00:00:19.800> your<00:00:20.070> typical<00:00:20.279> protein<00:00:21.060> supplement<00:00:21.660> it

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
not your typical protein supplement it

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
not your typical protein supplement it
actually<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:23.220> designed<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.850> deliver

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
actually is really designed to deliver

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.960 
actually is really designed to deliver
high<00:00:24.859> quantities<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> protein<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.640> your<00:00:26.789> body

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
high quantities of protein to your body

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.880 
high quantities of protein to your body
and<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.779> does<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:27.990> without<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> fat

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and it does that without all the fat

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
and it does that without all the fat
added<00:00:29.400> sugars<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.029> carbs<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.140> get

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
added sugars and carbs so you really get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
added sugars and carbs so you really get
down<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> basics<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.279> having<00:00:32.579> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
down to the basics of just having that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.600 
down to the basics of just having that
pure<00:00:33.540> protein<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> none<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> rest<00:00:35.219> that's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
pure protein and none of the rest that's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
pure protein and none of the rest that's
right<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> things<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.719> um<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.649> know

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
right now the things that um you know

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.670 
right now the things that um you know
apart<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.489> obvious<00:00:39.170> protein<00:00:40.170> content

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
apart from the obvious protein content

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.750 
apart from the obvious protein content
you're<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.070> inside<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> whey

overall wellness mm-hmm that's right
let's<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.629> back<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> protein<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> little

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
let's go back to the protein a little

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
let's go back to the protein a little
bit<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.010> Saito<00:00:56.250> away<00:00:56.579> isolate<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
bit so for Saito away isolate the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.150 
bit so for Saito away isolate the
manufacturers<00:00:58.170> actually<00:00:58.590> cite<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> study

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
manufacturers actually cite a study

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
manufacturers actually cite a study
where<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.320> isolate<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.680> helps<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
where they isolate really helps to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
where they isolate really helps to
increase<00:01:02.340> an<00:01:02.789> insulin<00:01:03.239> insulin<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:04.049> growth

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
increase an insulin insulin like growth

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.490 
increase an insulin insulin like growth
factor<00:01:04.799> called<00:01:05.150> IFG<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.900> actually

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
factor called IFG one which has actually

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.679 
factor called IFG one which has actually
been<00:01:07.799> proven<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.790> help<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.119> body<00:01:09.299> burn<00:01:09.659> fat

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
been proven to help the body burn fat

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.710 
been proven to help the body burn fat
more<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.560> also<00:01:11.310> increase<00:01:11.700> lean<00:01:12.119> muscle<00:01:12.689> mass

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
more and also increase lean muscle mass

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.179 
more and also increase lean muscle mass
so<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.290> pretty<00:01:13.530> cool<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:13.950> that

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
so that's pretty cool they have that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
so that's pretty cool they have that
study<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> back<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.689> also<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
study to back that up and then also the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
study to back that up and then also the
whey<00:01:16.320> isolate<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> contains<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
whey isolate also in contains a lot of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
whey isolate also in contains a lot of
peptides<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.740> help<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.100> body<00:01:20.310> on

one<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> great<00:01:28.650> things<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.070> side<00:01:29.400> away

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
one of the great things about side away

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
one of the great things about side away
isolate<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.930> claim<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
isolate is that they claim that the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.810 
isolate is that they claim that the
product<00:01:32.579> won't<00:01:32.880> clump<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.860> glob<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.549> you've

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
product won't clump or glob so if you've

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
product won't clump or glob so if you've
ever<00:01:35.939> had<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> protein<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.229> doesn't

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
ever had a protein that you know doesn't

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.840 
ever had a protein that you know doesn't
mix<00:01:37.770> well<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.520> makes<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
mix well you have to you know makes it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
mix well you have to you know makes it
another<00:01:38.939> lender<00:01:39.240> yeah<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> supposed<00:01:41.189> to
