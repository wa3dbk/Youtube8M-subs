00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
everything that it can do this is gonna

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.280 
everything that it can do this is gonna
be<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> test<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> camera<00:00:38.090> now<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> dunno<00:00:39.899> it's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
be a test of the camera now I dunno it's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.549 
be a test of the camera now I dunno it's
where<00:00:40.530> says<00:00:40.800> Ray's<00:00:41.100> got<00:00:41.340> 16<00:00:41.790> mega<00:00:42.030> Fitz

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559

it's<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> 16<00:00:44.969> x<00:00:45.510> optical<00:00:45.960> zoom<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:48.020> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's got a 16 x optical zoom on it so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's got a 16 x optical zoom on it so
that's<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.590> looks<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.890> I've

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that's what the back looks like I've

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.010 
that's what the back looks like I've
been<00:00:50.250> playing<00:00:50.460> around<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.809> she's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
been playing around with a lot so she's

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.639 
been playing around with a lot so she's
her<00:00:52.140> fingerprints<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.800> over<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:54.050> now<00:00:55.050> there's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
her fingerprints all over it now there's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.790 
her fingerprints all over it now there's
luck<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.039> said<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.520> plenty<00:00:56.699> of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
luck like I said there's plenty of

me switch this camera out further and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.120 
me switch this camera out further and
put<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> places<00:01:39.960> flip<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
put it in the places flip and see if it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.910 
put it in the places flip and see if it
still<00:01:42.090> yelling<00:01:42.390> difference<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> video<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
hang on one second okay so now we're

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.609 
hang on one second okay so now we're
we're<00:01:47.640> videoing<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> Canon<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> can
