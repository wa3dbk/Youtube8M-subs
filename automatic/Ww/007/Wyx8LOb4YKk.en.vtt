00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.349 
there you could snap a few people off
there<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.730> don't<00:02:17.849> want<00:02:17.969> to<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.120> there

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and get engagements couple things

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.190 
and get engagements couple things
obviously<00:02:20.639> this<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.060> probably<00:02:21.239> some<00:02:21.480> common

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
obviously this is probably some common

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.479 
obviously this is probably some common
sense<00:02:22.319> here<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.769> when<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.219> go<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.400> for

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
sense here but when you go in for

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.129 
sense here but when you go in for
headshots<00:02:23.670> would<00:02:24.060> say<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.299> scout<00:02:24.510> rifle<00:02:24.689> what

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
headshots would say the scout rifle what

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.780 
headshots would say the scout rifle what
I<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.499> do<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.739> I'll<00:02:25.920> wound<00:02:26.189> them<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.579> one

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I like to do is I'll wound them with one

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.849 
I like to do is I'll wound them with one
or<00:02:26.909> two<00:02:26.939> shots<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.569> body<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.079> then<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.680> for

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
or two shots to the body and then go for

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.020 
or two shots to the body and then go for
the<00:02:28.920> head<00:02:29.099> shot<00:02:29.310> remember<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.909> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the head shot remember they have to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
the head shot remember they have to
actually<00:02:30.209> die<00:02:30.629> with<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> head<00:02:31.109> shot<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
actually die with the head shot so the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
actually die with the head shot so the
shot<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> finishes<00:02:32.819> them<00:02:32.939> off<00:02:33.060> has<00:02:33.389> to<00:02:33.629> be

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
shot that finishes them off has to be

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.780 
shot that finishes them off has to be
yellow<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.829> terms<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.129> damage<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.459> hit<00:02:35.700> him
