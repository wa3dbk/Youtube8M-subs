00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:08.380
 Hey, guys, beauty, come on virginia. 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.809
 the first video of the secondary canal there 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.160
 in fact is the first video net had 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.110
 a video with its time before it was a 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.720
 video trollando and such but I solved it 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.880
 that this is not the focus of the channel that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.769
 this channel that more to talk with 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.060
 Are you talking about some things that 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.670
 I can not talk about the channel that is a 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.779
 friendlier to channel 18 such that there 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.000
 channel what I'm going to talk about things 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.830
 any shit is talking about some 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.160
 matters related to my life such 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.690
 talk about the other play other play 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.010
 games too 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.140
 and that's it and if this beginning of life and 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.170
 It reminded me so much of the beginning of my channel. 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.320
 main is for those who do not know what to me 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.200
 accompanies from the beginning of youtube knows 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.020
 which in the first video was a video 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.000
 commented and was dismissed from training 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.440
 I started making videos and mp3 on the channel if 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.910
 you will find why 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.220
 unfortunately I paid 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.020
 I should have left as in the state I 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.659
 I feel like I'm not in the state and if 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.909
 I can link in discretion to you but the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.119
 video or video when I started the channel 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.119
 It has been since the only that the here 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.659
 when I started the channel is my quality 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.999
 audio video sound was very bad 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.899
 I started the channel with an Ezekiel 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.759
 fulfilled 11 cap on a free market 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.049
 Ah I put it on my head, I'm going to make a game 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.749
 play the code 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.689
 I started to do is spend your time 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.939
 and I faced some vogue and 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.159
 I started doing a series there did not 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.770
 very sure does not give very good feedback 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.969
 so I stopped a bit is the channel is 2011 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.359
 2012 I'm not mistaken 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:46.539
 I stayed there for seven months for seven months 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.369
 So I decided to come back with videos of 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.479
 I just wanted to change the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.729
 format of videos is brought started 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.280
 making videos more indirectly is 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.719
 not directly when I 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.729
 I spoke directly to you as I am. 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.100
 doing now is in the videos that I do 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.749
 now it's in the main is a video more 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.999
 one of them straight up like this one talking to the 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:10.330
 friends and such doing some series the 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:13.240
 year causing people and there is this 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.400
 video walkthrough check out this video 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.990
 Egypt makes it a bit smaller and 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.240
 in October so there is something 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.650
 cool liked the channel so he 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.660
 I am now very happy with 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.200
 he is and I do not want to change the format 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.760
 I 'm going to get a subject that I 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.040
 I want to talk to you now I do not have 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.780
 nobody to play game that I am very 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 long then fuck 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 I just got out of this fucking bottom I thought 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.180
 would arrive 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.640
 so with you it's about is the code itself 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.880
 it's not because I 'm making the video 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.280
 the black ops 2 but backups 21 is the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.540
 current code is the old hi code of the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.790
 to work here and it is not the cut 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.320
 recent I started when the safe goals 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.410
 launched I started to make videos of 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.000
 ghost town is just realized that the feedback 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.020
 not very good despite your code 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.430
 most recent 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.970
 So I thought I'd go back to pro black ops. 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.170
 two want the channel up or did and 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.820
 to see the project that's how it was 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.850
 many authors have done very well even 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.780
 where code was were to gta or own 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.860
 bf 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.960
 Then I thought better and I decided to go 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.180
 I probel two that I used to record the 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.010
 I like to then burn it to me 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.980
 surprised by the feedback of seeing 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.840
 very good, I did not think that the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.390
 videos and b2 is to have such good feedback 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.040
 because it is an old code is more 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.770
 personal touches just series are liking 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.020
 so I'm very happy, that 's it 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.790
 also intending to change some things 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.470
 on the channel bring some more videos 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.760
 varied from time to time there are rather a 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.650
 video from gt to br4 is to bring some videos 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.730
 on the pc trying to improve I thought that 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.400
 bring some viruses on the pc as well and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.180
 that there is no more to talk about this 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.240
 fuck this channel so you will be 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.120
 but this does not have much practice 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.820
 I can comment videos so I 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.690
 I thought it was easy but now I'm 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.040
 Seeing that it is very complicated, you have to 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.620
 invent a lot of things at the time that has 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.540
 that make the video last until the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.010
 end of gameplay can comment everything 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.590
 talk about various subjects 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.840
 many and such I thought it was easy 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.780
 do this so many not all of them 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.900
 they did but it really is not easy it has to 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.690
 having a practice usually gets a practice 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.160
 it gets more light is good but 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.930
 to do but this is it for my first 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.760
 game play I can comment on the novelty is the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.280
 first I got the old channel o 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.670
 official channel the invitation was commented 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.410
 but for what the channel is today I am 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.360
 starting now and not second I guess 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.250
 That's a good video and that's it. I'll see if 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.410
 find the main channel videos 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.940
 that if you have as in the state leaves the 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.830
 description yet of the first videos 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.720
 channel that you compare as it was 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.700
 the quality of the start of the channel to the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.310
 quality of this channel here this channel 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.470
 I want to bring videos like this without 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.030
 a lot of obligation from time to time to 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.460
 talk about some subjects 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.860
 Wrong one is going and who is not going to be just 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.360
 cut can be also some gameplay 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.400
 videos that I do not post on another channel I 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.650
 Can I here is also going to be a channel 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.490
 more without obligation + hubble channel 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.050
 just to say to communicate with you that 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.490
 I think that's what's missing on the channel. 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.920
 communication with you as I 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.900
 I communicate very little on another channel with 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.690
 you this channel that will come out but come 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.810
 talk to you directly like this is 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.840
 is communicating and better integration 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.080
 this policy is and that's it folks 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.700
 This video is staying here if 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.410
 like this video do not forget 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.590
 leave you that if possible favorite to 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:04.320
 this if you want and that's it folks 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.320
 I'll tell you later.
