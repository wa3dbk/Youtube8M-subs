00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
my dead eyes on to the channels and I'll

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.340 
my dead eyes on to the channels and I'll
show<00:00:25.400> you<00:00:25.460> why<00:00:25.760> I<00:00:25.789> do<00:00:26.000> these<00:00:26.330> off<00:00:26.630> of<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:27.080> ship

show you why I do these off of the ship

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.640 
show you why I do these off of the ship
much<00:00:28.250> easier<00:00:28.850> because<00:00:28.970> I'm<00:00:29.289> handling<00:00:30.289> such

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
to put that on there it'd be a lot

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.399 
to put that on there it'd be a lot
easier<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.910> do<00:01:16.910> this

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
okay so I grabbed a piece of wire and I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.249 
okay so I grabbed a piece of wire and I
kind<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.320> bend<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.649> in<00:01:32.799> half<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.020> get

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
kind of bend it in half so you get

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
kind of bend it in half so you get
something<00:01:35.560> like<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:37.479> have<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.750> Deadeye

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
something like that we have the Deadeye

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.850 
something like that we have the Deadeye
and<00:01:40.360> wrap<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.990> around<00:01:41.049> at<00:01:41.470> Deadeye<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:44.770> it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
and wrap it around at Deadeye get it

then I'll grab this pair of flat pliers

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.050 
then I'll grab this pair of flat pliers
give<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.110> half<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.500> turn<00:02:18.599> nice<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.630> tight<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
another half a turn so you wind up with

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.680 
another half a turn so you wind up with
that<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:30.069> I'll<00:02:30.250> take<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.760> side<00:02:31.000> cutters<00:02:31.450> and

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
snip off one of them now I've watched

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.479 
snip off one of them now I've watched
another<00:02:36.970> fella<00:02:37.329> do<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.829> Internet

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
another fella do this on the Internet

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.539 
another fella do this on the Internet
but<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.239> think<00:02:40.510> he<00:02:40.660> was<00:02:40.870> working<00:02:41.260> with<00:02:41.549> probably

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
but I think he was working with probably

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.390 
but I think he was working with probably
five<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.329> maybe<00:02:43.450> even<00:02:43.630> seven<00:02:44.319> millimeter<00:02:44.799> dead

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
five or maybe even seven millimeter dead

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.140 
five or maybe even seven millimeter dead
eyes<00:02:45.660> which<00:02:46.660> makes<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.139> big<00:02:47.350> difference<00:02:48.150> now

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
eyes which makes a big difference now

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.050 
eyes which makes a big difference now
this<00:02:49.329> wire<00:02:49.690> I'm<00:02:50.079> using<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.829> picked<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.790> up<00:02:51.910> at

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
this wire I'm using I picked it up at

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.129 
this wire I'm using I picked it up at
Hobby<00:02:52.299> Lobby<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.989> 24<00:02:55.989> gauge<00:02:56.290> wire<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.989> it's

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
Hobby Lobby it's a 24 gauge wire so it's

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.080 
Hobby Lobby it's a 24 gauge wire so it's
pretty<00:02:59.319> flexible<00:02:59.560> I<00:03:00.040> can<00:03:00.220> almost<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.880> by

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
pretty flexible I can almost do this by

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.420 
pretty flexible I can almost do this by
hand<00:03:01.359> but<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.959> want<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.950> get<00:03:03.040> them<00:03:03.160> nice<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
hand but I want to get them nice and

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.780 
hand but I want to get them nice and
tight<00:03:03.730> now<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:05.350> dead<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> will<00:03:05.859> still<00:03:06.250> spin<00:03:06.639> in

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
tight now that dead I will still spin in

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.050 
tight now that dead I will still spin in
there<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:08.139> there's<00:03:08.410> no<00:03:08.650> need<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.549> worry<00:03:09.880> about

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
there so there's no need to worry about

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.460 
there so there's no need to worry about
positioning<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.410> that's<00:03:14.620> what<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:14.859> got

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
positioning of it so that's what I got

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.020 
positioning of it so that's what I got
pick<00:03:17.470> up<00:03:17.650> my<00:03:17.799> channel

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
pick up my channel

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.080 
pick up my channel
run<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.690> through<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.990> hole<00:03:21.640> when<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.760> get<00:03:22.940> it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
run it through the hole when you get it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.840 
run it through the hole when you get it
in<00:03:23.240> there<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.320> about<00:03:24.710> with<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.640> step

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
in there it's just about with this step

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.180 
in there it's just about with this step
of<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.240> half<00:03:26.510> terms<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:27.260> just<00:03:27.530> about<00:03:27.800> hides

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
of to half terms it just about hides

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.370 
of to half terms it just about hides
hides<00:03:28.730> them<00:03:29.090> inside<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.660> wood<00:03:29.870> there<00:03:30.140> so<00:03:30.320> you

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
hides them inside the wood there so you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.440 
hides them inside the wood there so you
don't<00:03:30.590> really<00:03:30.800> see<00:03:30.920> them<00:03:31.160> sticking<00:03:31.610> out<00:03:31.760> too

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
don't really see them sticking out too

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.010 
don't really see them sticking out too
much<00:03:32.660> at<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.960> bottom<00:03:34.270> now<00:03:35.270> I'll<00:03:35.390> take<00:03:35.570> my<00:03:35.780> side

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
much at the bottom now I'll take my side

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.760 
much at the bottom now I'll take my side
cutters<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.150> leave<00:03:38.150> about<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.960> quarter<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.560> an

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
cutters and leave about a quarter of an

inch and snip it off take my needle nose

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.380 
inch and snip it off take my needle nose
and<00:03:46.400> just<00:03:46.700> barely<00:03:47.270> grab<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.050> end<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
and just barely grab the end of it and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.090 
and just barely grab the end of it and
twist<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.830> needle<00:03:52.220> nose<00:03:52.430> around<00:03:52.730> on<00:03:53.270> yourself

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.949 

the<00:03:58.100> left<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.550> little<00:03:58.730> bit<00:03:58.970> too<00:03:59.270> much<00:03:59.480> there<00:03:59.750> let

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
the left a little bit too much there let

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.540 
the left a little bit too much there let
me<00:04:00.050> straighten<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.530> out<00:04:00.680> let<00:04:00.830> me<00:04:00.890> clip<00:04:01.340> off<00:04:01.520> a

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
me straighten this out let me clip off a

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.300 
me straighten this out let me clip off a
little<00:04:01.820> bit<00:04:02.000> more<00:04:05.350> alright<00:04:06.350> take<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.130> needle

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
little bit more alright take the needle

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.650 
little bit more alright take the needle
nose<00:04:07.930> we<00:04:08.930> have<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.380> end<00:04:10.060> rolled<00:04:11.060> around<00:04:11.330> on

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
nose we have the end rolled around on

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.949 
nose we have the end rolled around on
itself<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:13.940> wind<00:04:14.180> up<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.450> little<00:04:14.900> loop<00:04:16.959> now

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
itself and you wind up a little loop now

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.070 
itself and you wind up a little loop now
straighten<00:04:18.440> it<00:04:18.530> out<00:04:19.209> take<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.419> chain<00:04:22.900> hook<00:04:23.900> it

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
straighten it out take the chain hook it

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.629 
straighten it out take the chain hook it
on<00:04:24.230> there

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.999 

and<00:04:27.090> finish<00:04:27.569> curling<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.349> little<00:04:28.770> loop

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
and finish curling this little loop

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:38.740 
and finish curling this little loop
around

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.390 

a<00:04:38.810> change<00:04:39.740> stuck<00:04:41.140> this<00:04:42.140> isn't<00:04:42.590> easy<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:46.130> took

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
a change stuck this isn't easy it took

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.080 
a change stuck this isn't easy it took
me<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> while<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.850> figure<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.720> out<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:50.030> you

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
me a while to figure this out so you

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.310 
me a while to figure this out so you
wind<00:04:50.420> up<00:04:50.570> with<00:04:50.720> something<00:04:51.110> like<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:53.320> now

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
wind up with something like that now

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.410 
wind up with something like that now
here's<00:04:54.680> one<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.040> them<00:04:55.250> finished<00:04:58.090> now<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.150> can

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
here's one of them finished now you can

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.290 
here's one of them finished now you can
see<00:04:59.660> on<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.080> end<00:05:00.370> where<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.400> hid<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:01.850> little

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
see on the end where I hid that little

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.940 
see on the end where I hid that little
pin<00:05:04.180> there's<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.500> block<00:05:06.500> goes<00:05:06.890> in<00:05:07.130> there<00:05:08.950> and

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
pin there's a block goes in there and

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.270 
pin there's a block goes in there and
that's<00:05:10.340> basically<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.940> same<00:05:11.240> principle<00:05:11.900> and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
that's basically the same principle and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.450 
that's basically the same principle and
those<00:05:13.280> little<00:05:13.700> things<00:05:13.910> are<00:05:14.830> smaller<00:05:15.830> than<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
those little things are smaller than the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.250 
those little things are smaller than the
dead<00:05:16.670> eyes<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:19.130> there<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:20.000> thought<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.080> dead

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
dead eyes so there I thought the dead

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.200 
dead eyes so there I thought the dead
eyes<00:05:21.440> were<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> treat<00:05:22.160> these<00:05:22.550> are<00:05:22.790> worse<00:05:25.210> so

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
eyes were a treat these are worse so

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.080 
eyes were a treat these are worse so
that<00:05:26.390> when<00:05:26.540> I<00:05:26.630> get<00:05:26.810> done<00:05:27.050> with<00:05:27.230> this<00:05:27.850> then<00:05:28.850> I'll

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
that when I get done with this then I'll

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.660 
that when I get done with this then I'll
be<00:05:29.300> able<00:05:29.450> to<00:05:29.720> take<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.170> ship<00:05:32.290> and<00:05:33.430> glue<00:05:34.430> them

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
be able to take the ship and glue them

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.290 
be able to take the ship and glue them
into<00:05:34.880> position<00:05:35.510> on<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.900> side<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.140> the<00:05:36.440> ship

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
into position on the side of the ship

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.800 
into position on the side of the ship
now<00:05:38.300> once<00:05:38.600> it's<00:05:38.840> up<00:05:39.050> there<00:05:39.410> I<00:05:40.150> don't<00:05:41.150> attach<00:05:41.510> to

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
now once it's up there I don't attach to

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.670 
now once it's up there I don't attach to
change<00:05:42.110> yet<00:05:42.530> I<00:05:43.150> wait<00:05:44.150> until<00:05:44.510> I<00:05:44.630> find<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.110> angle

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
change yet I wait until I find the angle

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.180 
change yet I wait until I find the angle
of<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.550> shroud<00:05:46.880> line<00:05:47.240> coming<00:05:47.660> down<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:48.320> that

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
of the shroud line coming down and that

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.520 
of the shroud line coming down and that
chain<00:05:49.580> should<00:05:49.970> follow<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:50.630> angle<00:05:51.170> all<00:05:51.380> the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
chain should follow that angle all the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.970 
chain should follow that angle all the
way<00:05:51.650> down<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.190> side<00:05:52.400> of<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:52.730> ship<00:05:53.060> and

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
way down to the side of the ship and

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.070 
way down to the side of the ship and
then<00:05:54.980> I'll<00:05:55.160> nail<00:05:55.760> them<00:05:55.970> on<00:05:56.120> like<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.600> or<00:05:56.990> you

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
then I'll nail them on like that or you

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.100 
then I'll nail them on like that or you
can<00:05:57.290> even<00:05:57.440> grab<00:05:57.620> a<00:05:57.680> hold<00:05:57.890> that<00:05:58.040> chain<00:05:58.960> so<00:05:59.960> they

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
can even grab a hold that chain so they

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.780 
can even grab a hold that chain so they
don't<00:06:00.320> come<00:06:00.590> straight<00:06:00.980> down<00:06:01.010> they're

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
don't come straight down they're
