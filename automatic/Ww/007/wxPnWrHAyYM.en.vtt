00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:08.559
 seem if doubts and certain problems 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.780
 that sometimes doing baths generates 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.490
 done this video to give them some 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.300
 suggestions on how to make a bath that 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.010
 be durable 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.920
 The first thing they have to understand is 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.700
 that the bathroom is an interactive place in 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.950
 this case I'm building a bathroom 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.600
 for a fourth teacher or the fourth 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.700
 main house that means that 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.439
 At least two people will be 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 using this bathroom constantly 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.760
 he wants the wife putting on his 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.040
 makeup and then bathing or 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.840
 vice versa 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.670
 this gave us the form of makeup but 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.690
 You can first be dressing while 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 then he is using 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.840
 in regular houses the space is very 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.210
 limited for bathrooms and once 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.410
 you have the opportunity to do 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.989
 bathrooms 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 in their own way or suddenly modify them 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.210
 to improve the performance of your hand 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.620
 there are some 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.000
 things that you have to have in 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.610
 The first is that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
 the shower must be a place what 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.500
 big enough to be able 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.110
 take the time and relax in a 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 shower is more if it is possible to put a 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.270
 small bench inside the shower is what 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.600
 I recommend if you see this is a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.600
 shower 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.950
 for that purpose you have two taps one 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.710
 on this side and the other on this side the one 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.079
 was this side has the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.610
 characteristic of creating water from above 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.549
 can shower in the head of the shower 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.500
 and this is going to be used for something that 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.510
 hold your hand 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.030
 I always recommend the bathrooms 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.730
 make them with concrete sheets and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 use a plastic membrane like 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.630
 sealant or fiberglass mesh 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.200
 fiberglass to be able to retain all 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.710
 the unions 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.420
 another very important thing is that they use 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.010
 concrete and its respective 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.620
 waterproofing that is in this case is 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.070
 a plastic moon called 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.870
 or pvc and this thing is designed to 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.810
 be able to retain water in the form of 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.940
 tub but the difference here to make 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.820
 a hard skeet bath 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.120
 it will not be damaged or it will not deteriorate 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.819
 as do the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.569
 to showers fiber shower bases 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.680
 glass another very important thing is that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.110
 in this bathroom if you look at me 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.360
 opening the doors that have a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.519
 rotating movement I am using 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.769
 some doors that are called doors of 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.049
 pocket or any tours and they will 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.970
 they help they slide inside a 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.970
 wall 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.540
 hollow and slide inwards 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.700
 to be able to evade this Sunday 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.220
 rotating movement of the ropes 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.020
 then that is a very characteristic 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.820
 important also the doors 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.190
 calls we facilitate or doors 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.330
 pocket another very important thing is that 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.260
 dedicate direct electricity lines 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.240
 for the bathrooms and this is the reason 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.690
 While 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.880
 there is lighting in a bathroom and 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.500
 connected to a main room that 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.780
 electricians usually in this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.310
 I really do not like it when 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.590
 begin to use the hair dryer 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.240
 and the wife is using the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.340
 hair heater I see the air 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.020
 begins it begins to absorb a lot 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.420
 electricity then we have the shower 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.730
 functioning of many other things and 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.069
 normally the systems are turned off 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.790
 then please Dedicate 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.980
 in a circuit to your bathroom also 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:57.090
 use a 12 gauge cable and this 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.469
 normally they use 114 and a ger man 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.510
 15 in face but use a cable 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.700
 a little thicker is always going to help 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.969
 prevent problems directly from to 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.689
 as you know it is necessary that 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.639
 have ground switches 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.280
 inside the bathrooms to avoid some 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.320
 type of electro mutation by means of 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.720
 all the appliances that use inside 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.539
 another very important thing is that you 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.419
 of having good electricity inside 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:32.490
 the bathrooms and with this lighting with 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.380
 this with this I want to tell you that it is not 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.870
 what 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.180
 you have to have many lights in one 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.160
 just switch and not on the other hand when 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.140
 a large area is used as having 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.710
 a dedicated area for that one area 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.500
 dedicated for the shower for the hallway and 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.940
 for him for the mirror and another for the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.880
 parents for him 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.480
 he and he named the toilet bowl now this 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.090
 toilet bowl is separated a bit from the 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.250
 normal bath meat because we want 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.790
 that there is a bit of privacy 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.350
 also has 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.300
 a little 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.220
 a fan a warrant to be able 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.060
 keep this this is a bit a bit 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.120
 more added 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.220
 fasting and also from an outlet to 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.220
 to connect some kind of d 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.810
 of decoration or something that can suddenly 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.150
 emit some kind of pain a fragrance 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.400
 nice it is important also that in 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.720
 the bathrooms if you do not so many times 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.620
 when one uses the bathrooms the bathrooms or 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.510
 especially where is the toilet 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.580
 being very quiet you can hear the 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.389
 conversations on the other side of the wall 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.389
 Well, that's going to happen 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.180
 use insolation or this fiber of 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.310
 glass for or any material that is 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.169
 acoustic to be able to help 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.050
 retain the sound inside this cup 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.419
 of the bathroom another very important challenge is that 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.240
 when one is inside the shower 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.560
 always have to be careful of the 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.590
 parts is using a sheet of 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.900
 complete here and in these parts always 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.000
 assume that water only by 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.300
 any hole then do that 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.430
 there is always some type of umbrella or 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.960
 of cover so that it does not look inside 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.530
 the small cracks worn in this 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.530
 profitable 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.820
 I recommend you also use new 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.480
 new plumbing new pipe identify 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.370
 the pipeline and protect it just in case 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.980
 someone is yours in screws where no 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.990
 it must be and it's going to be some damage then 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.840
 there were some of the recommendations 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.730
 what I give them to avoid 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.919
 these problems that usually happen 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.840
 inside the bathroom because I hope that they 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.840
 have liked and see you soon
