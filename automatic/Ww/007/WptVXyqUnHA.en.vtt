one of the most unique parts of the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.540 
one of the most unique parts of the
continued<00:00:59.609> cage<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.870> rod<00:01:01.350> mount<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
continued cage the rod mount which is a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.479 
continued cage the rod mount which is a
new<00:01:02.789> thing<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:03.329> view<00:01:04.019> factor<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:05.280> has<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
new thing from view factor that has a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
new thing from view factor that has a
feature<00:01:06.060> called<00:01:06.210> multi<00:01:06.780> force<00:01:07.189> sounds<00:01:08.189> pretty

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
feature called multi force sounds pretty

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
feature called multi force sounds pretty
cool<00:01:08.640> almost<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.330> Delta<00:01:09.750> Force<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.229> Chuck

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
cool almost like Delta Force with Chuck

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
cool almost like Delta Force with Chuck
Norris<00:01:10.820> definitely<00:01:11.820> strong<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.420> Chuck

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
Norris definitely strong like Chuck

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
Norris definitely strong like Chuck
Norris<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.880> it's<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> sort<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
Norris so it's got a sort of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
Norris so it's got a sort of
spring-loaded<00:01:15.840> mechanism<00:01:16.549> where<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> can

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
spring-loaded mechanism where you can

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.359 
spring-loaded mechanism where you can
load<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> rods<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.950> with<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> minimum

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
load the rods in and with a minimum

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.990 
load the rods in and with a minimum
amount<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:24.060> effort<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> lock<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.790> down

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
amount of effort you can lock them down

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.890 
amount of effort you can lock them down
and<00:01:27.920> they'll<00:01:28.920> really<00:01:29.189> stay<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:30.030> not

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and they'll really stay like that's not

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
and they'll really stay like that's not
going<00:01:31.110> anywhere<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.860> barely<00:01:32.070> turn<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
going anywhere and I barely turn that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.420 
going anywhere and I barely turn that
like<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> quarter<00:01:33.210> turn<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> see

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
like a quarter turn so you can see

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.160 
like a quarter turn so you can see
that's<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> keep<00:01:36.329> your<00:01:36.479> map<00:01:36.900> box

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that's really going to keep your map box

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.350 
that's really going to keep your map box
from<00:01:37.770> falling<00:01:38.130> off<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.610> any<00:01:39.180> other

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
from falling off for any other

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
from falling off for any other
accessories<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.470> hanging<00:01:41.100> off
