00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
milk so let's get started so let's give

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.980 
milk so let's get started so let's give
her<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:38.060> ground<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.780> stand<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.320> let<00:04:40.160> that<00:04:40.340> and

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
her the ground to stand on let that and

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.460 
her the ground to stand on let that and
give<00:04:41.990> her<00:04:42.169> a<00:04:42.200> ball<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.590> yarn<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.250> straw<00:04:43.610> circle

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.409 

I'm<00:04:48.470> using<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:49.010> thinner<00:04:49.280> pen<00:04:49.669> just<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.120> show<00:04:50.360> you

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
I'm using a thinner pen just to show you

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.379 
I'm using a thinner pen just to show you
because<00:04:50.840> these<00:04:51.110> items<00:04:51.320> are<00:04:51.620> smaller<00:04:52.389> but

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
because these items are smaller but

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.390 
because these items are smaller but
they're<00:04:53.780> smaller<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:54.440> if<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.830> use<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.190> thicker

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
they're smaller so if I use the thicker

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.219 
they're smaller so if I use the thicker
sharpie<00:04:55.820> everything<00:04:56.479> will<00:04:56.600> blend<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.169> you

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
sharpie everything will blend in and you

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.010 
sharpie everything will blend in and you
some<00:04:57.740> be<00:04:58.310> hard<00:04:58.520> for<00:04:58.669> you<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.970> see<00:04:59.180> so<00:04:59.780> I'm<00:04:59.840> just

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
some be hard for you to see so I'm just

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.219 
some be hard for you to see so I'm just
using<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.410> thinner<00:05:00.680> sharpie<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.990> for<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.080> ball

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
using a thinner sharpie and for the ball

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.450 
using a thinner sharpie and for the ball
of<00:05:03.380> yarn<00:05:03.530> let's<00:05:04.190> draw<00:05:04.430> some<00:05:04.640> curved<00:05:04.850> lines

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
of yarn let's draw some curved lines

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:15.070 
of yarn let's draw some curved lines
maybe<00:05:07.460> three<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.910> go<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.300> way<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:14.080> some

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
maybe three that go that way and some

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.600 
maybe three that go that way and some
that<00:05:15.200> go<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.590> way<00:05:16.539> just<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.720> indicate

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
that go that way just to indicate

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.590 
that go that way just to indicate
strands<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.789> yarn

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
strands of yarn

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.040 
strands of yarn
of<00:05:21.840> course<00:05:23.750> one<00:05:24.750> that's<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.350> loose<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:27.050> let's

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
of course one that's a loose and let's

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.920 
of course one that's a loose and let's
hear<00:05:28.380> Bowl<00:05:29.360> get<00:05:30.360> give<00:05:30.750> her<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.930> bowl<00:05:31.290> of<00:05:31.500> milk<00:05:31.940> so

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.990 

dry<00:05:36.930> Louisville<00:05:41.510> slanting<00:05:42.510> line<00:05:42.660> down<00:05:42.990> and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
dry Louisville slanting line down and

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000 
dry Louisville slanting line down and
follow<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.240> curve<00:05:48.110> and<00:05:49.110> another<00:05:49.350> line<00:05:49.800> up

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
follow the curve and another line up

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.190 
follow the curve and another line up
here<00:05:51.590> into<00:05:52.590> some<00:05:53.040> line<00:05:53.310> just<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:54.140> kind<00:05:55.140> of

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
here into some line just to kind of

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.450 
here into some line just to kind of
indicate<00:05:56.090> some<00:05:57.090> liquids<00:05:57.510> in<00:05:57.660> there<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.460> let's

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
indicate some liquids in there and let's

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.920 
indicate some liquids in there and let's
write<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.880> word<00:06:00.090> milk<00:06:05.210> for<00:06:06.210> a<00:06:06.240> little<00:06:06.540> camera

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
write the word milk for a little camera

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.100 
write the word milk for a little camera
here<00:06:07.170> and<00:06:10.160> there<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.580> of<00:06:12.210> course<00:06:12.240> we<00:06:12.720> have<00:06:12.960> to

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
