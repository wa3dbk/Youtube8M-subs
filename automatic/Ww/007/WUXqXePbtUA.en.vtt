00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.089
 hello today I want to tell you how we can 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.520
 make this nice picture to put it in 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.709
 a deep frame the materials that 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.170
 we are going to employ would be a framework with 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.960
 depth a card with the same 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.939
 Size of our frame modeling paste 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.339
 that stays dry to the air tail of 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.560
 silicone and some permanent markers 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.349
 of different colors 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.630
 The first thing we are going to do is in the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.220
 cardboard that we have cut with the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.460
 size of the frame we will signal by 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:41.199
 where goes this frame that goes inside 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:45.070
 to know what area is left 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.260
 hidden once placed the rough frame 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.500
 of modeling brown we're going to do 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.440
 a rectangle and we're going to throw a 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.890
 little bit of silicone glue on the edge 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 and then we're going to put it a little bit 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.059
 above where the brands are 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.979
 as two fingers approximately with the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.170
 pink we have made a triangle 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.080
 we will shape the bottom 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.689
 of the dress to have a little bit of 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.150
 way and a little volume that is a 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.189
 where will the doll of this 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 way what we're going to do to 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.299
 next is to take the macaroni that 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.789
 we have made white we are going to 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.850
 put pressure on a part of the of 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.859
 down to do the shape of the sleeve and 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.469
 the top part we are going to make a 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.929
 small inclination so that we are 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.600
 stay like this with a little ball of color 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.579
 We'll go orange and we'll let it go 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.009
 to put here in the sleeve then 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.990
 what we are going to do is in the dress 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.319
 we are going to be placed in the part of here 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.960
 back where it 's smoother we're going to 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.659
 put on the sleeve so that we stay 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.240
 well once we have placed the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.340
 little arms now what we are going to do is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.009
 take a little bit of the spaghetti that we have 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.160
 done before and let's do the neck 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.340
 for the little dress we are going to make a 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.870
 species like of lagrimita and we're going 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.349
 to put on the part of the dress here 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.230
 so that it stays like this then for the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.599
 tie of the dress we are going to catch also 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.690
 spaghetti and we're going to do it more 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.500
 delgadito still and we're going to put it 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.829
 in here in the middle area and that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.769
 we stayed like this and then we're going to 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.200
 take the white marker and let's 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.989
 make little flowers in the dress 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.970
 now we are going to throw glue of cola 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.489
 silicone this area here is to 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.319
 where will it be stuck on the cardboard 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.989
 now we take our cardboard and the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.370
 we put on a side so that we 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.680
 stay like this 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.049
 Now let's take the black color 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.810
 we have made a noodle let's take a 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.630
 Let's do a piece ball one 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.330

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.700
 small pieces of noodle and let's go 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.150
 shaping it with a little pink 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.380
 let's make a small ornament in the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.120
 hair so that it stays like that 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.460
 Now what we are going to do is the doll 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.070
 Well, the first thing we do is take the 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.710
 triangle and give it the shape of the body 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.900
 as if he were sitting now what 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.780

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.690
 are the two macaroni we are going to smooth the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.280
 part of where the hand is going to go 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.830
 the same way we have done with the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.950
 doll then we will take one of the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.280
 orange balls and let's put it on 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.180
 inside to want the hand shape of 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.940
 behind the little boss we are going to put the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.640
 arm once we have it that way 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.130
 let's put what is the hood 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.130
 for this we are going to give it the form asÃ­a 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.870
 rounded and we are going to be placed in the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.790
 wall and have given way to the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.820
 hood now let's take a little 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.160
 of white spaghetti and we're going to get in 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.500
 a what is the edge and then by the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.300

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.069
 let's make small ornaments once 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.050
 that we have already done the drawing 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.210
 6 what we are going to do is take 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.150
 silicone glue in this area 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.539
 from here and already stick it to the cardboard 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.910
 if now we are going to hit him the neck 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.870

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.590
 and now let's hit the head and let's go 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.710
 to put it on like this let's take the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.070
 spaghetti let's make little strips 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.470
 and we are going to be placing them in a way 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.570
 that it looks like boy hair and a 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.610
 Once we have placed all the hair 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.880
 to the doll what we are going to do to 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.800
 continuation are the flowers that already as 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.200
 you want then we are going to do 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.570
 enough flowers to occupy all this 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.790
 area down here once we 've already 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.180
 finished placing the flowers we were 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.090
 it would be like that and it would stay that way 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.250
