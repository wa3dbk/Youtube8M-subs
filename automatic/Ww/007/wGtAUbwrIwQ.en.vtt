00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.309 
and again i forgot to put on the
stopwatch<00:03:26.290> nice<00:03:27.569> again<00:03:28.569> i<00:03:28.780> got<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.049> get<00:03:29.200> this

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
stopwatch nice again i got to get this

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.470 
stopwatch nice again i got to get this
down<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> science<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.939> look<00:03:31.060> at<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.209> it's

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
down to a science and look at that it's

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.479 
down to a science and look at that it's
picks<00:03:32.349> out<00:03:32.530> like<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.769> sore<00:03:33.129> thumb<00:03:34.019> compact<00:03:35.019> disc

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
picks out like a sore thumb compact disc

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.940 
picks out like a sore thumb compact disc
let<00:03:36.489> us<00:03:36.610> take<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.000> disc<00:03:37.409> see<00:03:38.409> what<00:03:38.590> we<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.829> do

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
let us take this disc see what we can do

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.940 
let us take this disc see what we can do
with<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.629> got<00:03:40.659> a<00:03:40.780> little<00:03:40.930> happier<00:03:41.319> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.349 

remember<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:44.980> middle<00:03:45.340> computer<00:03:45.819> needed<00:03:46.090> on

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
remember the middle computer needed on

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.949 
remember the middle computer needed on
disc<00:03:46.810> wrong<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> let's<00:03:48.459> do<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:52.390> compact

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
disc wrong so let's do that the compact

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.460 
disc wrong so let's do that the compact
disc<00:03:53.379> early<00:03:54.250> 90s<00:03:54.959> then<00:03:55.959> weren't<00:03:56.109> hip<00:03:56.349> enough

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
disc early 90s then weren't hip enough

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:09.250 
disc early 90s then weren't hip enough
to<00:03:56.620> call<00:03:56.889> them<00:03:57.040> cds<00:03:57.400> yet<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.569> compact<00:03:59.079> disc

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:20.509
