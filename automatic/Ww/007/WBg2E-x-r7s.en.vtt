and<00:00:54.489> sure<00:00:55.489> there<00:00:55.640> were<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:55.730> couple<00:00:55.789> transformer

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
and sure there were a couple transformer

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.810

games<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:56.989> were<00:00:57.280> okay<00:00:58.280> but<00:00:58.579> there<00:00:58.760> were

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
games that were okay but there were

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
when I see this game I think of

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.170 
when I see this game I think of
battlefield<00:01:02.539> 24<00:01:02.839> t<00:01:03.079> too<00:01:03.289> long<00:01:03.620> for<00:01:03.920> 2142<00:01:04.699> of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
battlefield 24 t too long for 2142 of

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.510 
battlefield 24 t too long for 2142 of
all<00:01:05.480> things<00:01:05.750> because<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.890> don't<00:01:07.159> know<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:07.250> see

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
all things because I don't know I see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.249 
all things because I don't know I see
these<00:01:07.640> big<00:01:07.880> ships<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.540> sky<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.780> their

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
these big ships in the sky and their

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.830 
these big ships in the sky and their
battleships<00:01:10.100> or<00:01:10.310> flagships<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.090> they

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
battleships or flagships and they

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.499 
battleships or flagships and they
totally<00:01:12.350> remind<00:01:12.680> me<00:01:12.829> out<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.579> titans<00:01:14.299> that

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
totally remind me out of the titans that

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.690 
totally remind me out of the titans that
you've<00:01:14.689> jumped<00:01:14.899> out<00:01:15.079> of<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.320> 2142<00:01:15.950> if<00:01:16.280> anyone

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
you've jumped out of in 2142 if anyone

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.999 
you've jumped out of in 2142 if anyone
even<00:01:17.060> played<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.570> game<00:01:17.720> out<00:01:17.960> there<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.380> think

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
even played that game out there I think

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.260 
even played that game out there I think
it<00:01:19.070> was<00:01:19.100> with<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> pretty<00:01:19.610> big<00:01:19.790> failure<00:01:20.119> but

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
it was with a pretty big failure but

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.709 
it was with a pretty big failure but
Hawkin<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.439> free<00:01:22.219> to<00:01:22.310> play<00:01:22.340> FPS<00:01:22.640> they<00:01:23.509> will

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
Hawkin is a free to play FPS they will

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.840 
Hawkin is a free to play FPS they will
have<00:01:23.899> in-game<00:01:24.380> items<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:24.950> buy<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.130> think<00:01:25.700> they

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
have in-game items to buy I think they

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.490 
have in-game items to buy I think they
hinted<00:01:26.149> at<00:01:26.299> buying<00:01:26.509> different<00:01:26.719> weapons<00:01:27.229> or

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
hinted at buying different weapons or

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.740 
hinted at buying different weapons or
different<00:01:27.740> outfits<00:01:28.159> stuff<00:01:28.430> like<00:01:28.610> that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
different outfits stuff like that

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.940 
different outfits stuff like that
hopefully<00:01:29.750> nothing<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.200> will<00:01:30.290> be<00:01:30.409> super<00:01:30.740> off

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
hopefully nothing that will be super off

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.160 
hopefully nothing that will be super off
balancing<00:01:31.490> but<00:01:31.729> again<00:01:32.360> it's<00:01:32.659> free<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:33.020> play

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
balancing but again it's free to play

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.770 
balancing but again it's free to play
initially<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:33.950> really<00:01:34.250> how<00:01:34.880> much<00:01:35.090> money<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:35.719> a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
initially so really how much money is a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.660 
initially so really how much money is a
weapon<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.649> know<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.829> can<00:01:37.159> invest<00:01:37.430> in<00:01:37.610> a

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
weapon you know you can invest in a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.010 
weapon you know you can invest in a
couple<00:01:37.969> weapons<00:01:38.299> here<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.570> there<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:38.899> you

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
couple weapons here and there and you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.569 
couple weapons here and there and you
probably<00:01:39.409> won't<00:01:39.619> hit<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:39.860> maximum<00:01:40.369> price

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
probably won't hit the maximum price

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.429 
probably won't hit the maximum price

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
cover that for a second it's basically

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.169 
cover that for a second it's basically
when<00:02:00.799> you<00:02:00.829> have<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.250> HUD<00:02:01.490> on<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.909> screen<00:02:02.149> just

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
when you have the HUD on the screen just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.910 
when you have the HUD on the screen just
heads<00:02:02.659> up<00:02:02.810> display<00:02:03.140> through<00:02:03.500> those<00:02:03.649> who<00:02:03.740> don't

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
now on the screen just like normally

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.870 
now on the screen just like normally
except<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.920> actually<00:02:07.340> build<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.759> into

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
except you actually build it into

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.490 
except you actually build it into
something<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> game<00:02:08.960> so<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.350> makes

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
something in the game so that it makes

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.100 
something in the game so that it makes
sense<00:02:09.800> for<00:02:10.130> example<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.090> game<00:02:11.270> grid<00:02:11.690> or

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
sense for example in the game grid or

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.130 
sense for example in the game grid or
another<00:02:12.320> racing<00:02:12.800> game

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

another racing game
you<00:02:13.560> can<00:02:13.680> actually<00:02:13.830> actually<00:02:14.340> disable<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
you can actually actually disable the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.180 
you can actually actually disable the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
opt to use only the in the car hugs so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.860 
opt to use only the in the car hugs so
it<00:02:20.550> was<00:02:20.670> kind<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.880> like<00:02:21.000> driving<00:02:21.390> an<00:02:21.480> actual

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
the bottom left in that circle it's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.910 
the bottom left in that circle it's
normally<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> hundreds<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.650> can

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
normally in the hundreds and you can

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.030 
normally in the hundreds and you can
actually<00:03:17.360> repair<00:03:18.360> yourself<00:03:18.630> or<00:03:19.260> something<00:03:19.950> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
actually repair yourself or something to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.560 
actually repair yourself or something to
that<00:03:20.070> extent<00:03:20.430> maybe<00:03:20.549> power<00:03:20.970> down<00:03:21.180> I'm<00:03:21.450> not

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
that extent maybe power down I'm not

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.880 
that extent maybe power down I'm not
sure<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.840> terminology<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.530> will<00:03:22.769> be

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
sure with the terminology that will be

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.590 
sure with the terminology that will be
used<00:03:23.100> as<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.030> do<00:03:24.120> some<00:03:24.329> kind<00:03:24.540> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
used as but you can do some kind of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.990 
used as but you can do some kind of
self-healing<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.500> basically<00:03:26.340> you'll<00:03:26.700> see<00:03:26.880> in

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
self-healing and basically you'll see in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.970 
self-healing and basically you'll see in
this<00:03:27.090> video<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.660> he's<00:03:28.230> getting<00:03:28.380> shot<00:03:28.769> at<00:03:28.950> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
this video that he's getting shot at and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.830 
this video that he's getting shot at and
runs<00:03:29.340> around<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.700> corner<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.180> sort<00:03:30.750> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
runs around the corner and sort of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.840 
runs around the corner and sort of
crouches<00:03:31.290> down<00:03:31.320> for<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:31.950> three<00:03:32.459> seconds

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
crouches down for like three seconds

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.880 
crouches down for like three seconds
that<00:03:33.000> he<00:03:33.090> has<00:03:33.269> while<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.959> guy<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.290> trying<00:03:34.739> to

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
that he has while this guy is trying to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.860 
that he has while this guy is trying to
find<00:03:35.160> them<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.820> those<00:03:35.970> three<00:03:36.239> seconds<00:03:36.720> give

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
find them and those three seconds give

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.990 
find them and those three seconds give
him<00:03:37.049> enough<00:03:37.320> health<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.739> run<00:03:38.640> through<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
him enough health to run through the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.180 
him enough health to run through the
smoke<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.480> escape<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.900> scene<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.560> then

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
smoke and escape the scene and then

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.860 
smoke and escape the scene and then
eventually<00:03:41.430> turn<00:03:41.970> around<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.390> flew<00:03:42.540> off<00:03:42.660> his

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
eventually turn around and flew off his

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
eventually turn around and flew off his
pursuer<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.950> that's<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.640> really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
pursuer so that's just that really

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.030 
pursuer so that's just that really
illustrates<00:03:45.299> how<00:03:45.810> fast-paced<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.620> game<00:03:46.829> is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
illustrates how fast-paced this game is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220 
illustrates how fast-paced this game is
and<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.700> think<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.060> self-healing<00:03:48.510> mechanic<00:03:49.079> is

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and I think the self-healing mechanic is

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.530 
and I think the self-healing mechanic is
sort<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.590> cool<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.310> definitely<00:03:50.820> not<00:03:50.970> unreal

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
sort of cool it's definitely not unreal

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.479 
sort of cool it's definitely not unreal
tournament<00:03:51.810> style<00:03:52.260> which<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.370> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
tournament style which is one of the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.580 
tournament style which is one of the
biggest<00:03:53.880> drop<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.600> pick<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.170> power<00:03:55.350> up

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
biggest drop and pick up and power up

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.650 
biggest drop and pick up and power up
based<00:03:55.799> games<00:03:56.100> out<00:03:56.459> there<00:03:56.519> however<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.570> have

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
based games out there however I have

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.330 
based games out there however I have
seen<00:03:58.200> some<00:03:58.380> stuff<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.739> looks<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.220> be<00:03:59.310> like

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
seen some stuff that looks to be like

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.190 
seen some stuff that looks to be like
pickups<00:03:59.850> they're<00:04:00.299> these<00:04:00.450> green<00:04:00.810> floating

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
pickups they're these green floating

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.600 
pickups they're these green floating
discs<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.430> background

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
discs that you see in the background

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.280 
discs that you see in the background
sometimes<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.299> think<00:04:03.570> there<00:04:03.720> may<00:04:03.750> still<00:04:03.989> be

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
sometimes so I think there may still be

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.080 
sometimes so I think there may still be
pickups<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.040> game<00:04:05.250> but<00:04:05.549> again<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> cell

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
pickups in this game but again the cell

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.610 
pickups in this game but again the cell
feeling<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> really<00:04:06.870> cool<00:04:06.989> mechanic<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
feeling is a really cool mechanic that I

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.710 
feeling is a really cool mechanic that I
think<00:04:07.860> will<00:04:07.980> help<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.310> keep<00:04:08.880> gameplay<00:04:09.359> alive

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
think will help to keep gameplay alive

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.780 
think will help to keep gameplay alive
it'll<00:04:10.019> take<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.500> away<00:04:10.769> from<00:04:10.799> what<00:04:11.489> really

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
it'll take you away from what really

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.270 
it'll take you away from what really
sort<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.090> kills<00:04:12.450> original<00:04:13.380> Halo<00:04:13.709> or<00:04:13.739> kills

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
sort of kills original Halo or kills

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.770 
sort of kills original Halo or kills
unreal<00:04:14.760> tournament<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.269> those<00:04:15.420> types<00:04:15.660> of

as going back to your face to find on
that<00:04:29.980> really<00:04:30.160> slows<00:04:30.520> gameplay<00:04:31.000> down<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.540> a

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
that really slows gameplay down it's a

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.720 
that really slows gameplay down it's a
chore<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.590> not<00:04:32.740> fun<00:04:33.010> sometimes<00:04:33.490> it's<00:04:33.670> just

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
chore it's not fun sometimes it's just

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.820 
chore it's not fun sometimes it's just
more<00:04:34.030> fun<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.390> die<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.840> then<00:04:34.990> respawn<00:04:35.470> it's

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
more fun to die and then respawn it's

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.340 
more fun to die and then respawn it's
even<00:04:36.040> faster<00:04:36.280> but<00:04:37.210> self<00:04:37.600> healing<00:04:37.870> will<00:04:38.110> help

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
even faster but self healing will help

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.500 
even faster but self healing will help
prevent<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.850> will<00:04:39.940> make<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.330> game

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
prevent that and it will make the game

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.140 
prevent that and it will make the game
it'll<00:04:41.380> keep<00:04:41.680> things<00:04:41.950> active<00:04:42.490> keep<00:04:42.970> things

it'll keep things active keep things

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
missiles hit and then on the right we

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.060 
missiles hit and then on the right we
typically<00:06:31.480> see<00:06:31.630> him<00:06:31.990> using<00:06:32.260> a<00:06:32.500> machine<00:06:32.680> gun

typically see him using a machine gun

which I don't really

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.800 
which I don't really
to<00:06:34.130> explain<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:34.580> we<00:06:35.090> also<00:06:35.300> see<00:06:35.570> in<00:06:35.720> the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
to explain that we also see in the

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.750 
to explain that we also see in the
bottom<00:06:36.200> right<00:06:36.320> of<00:06:36.350> the<00:06:36.500> HUD<00:06:36.830> there<00:06:37.310> are<00:06:37.490> a

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
bottom right of the HUD there are a

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.490 
bottom right of the HUD there are a

cheat charges he normally has three or

cheat charges he normally has three or
two<00:06:39.710> of<00:06:39.830> them<00:06:39.980> I<00:06:40.190> would<00:06:40.490> presume<00:06:40.670> that's<00:06:40.940> a<00:06:41.240> chi

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
two of them I would presume that's a chi

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.420 
two of them I would presume that's a chi
as<00:06:41.690> in<00:06:41.840> the<00:06:41.960> AG<00:06:42.260> three<00:06:42.470> nades<00:06:42.680> meaning

as in the AG three nades meaning

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.420 
as in the AG three nades meaning
fragmentation<00:06:44.330> so<00:06:44.630> those<00:06:45.140> are<00:06:45.170> that's<00:06:45.860> such<00:06:46.400> a

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
fragmentation so those are that's such a

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.830 
fragmentation so those are that's such a
speculation<00:06:47.060> I<00:06:47.270> don't<00:06:47.450> know<00:06:47.510> one<00:06:47.630> hundred

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
speculation I don't know one hundred

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.600 
speculation I don't know one hundred
percent<00:06:47.870> on<00:06:48.140> that<00:06:48.260> we<00:06:48.680> do<00:06:48.860> see<00:06:49.040> that<00:06:49.190> as<00:06:49.340> he

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
percent on that we do see that as he

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.430 
percent on that we do see that as he
gets<00:06:49.790> shot<00:06:49.850> his<00:06:50.270> health<00:06:50.510> obviously<00:06:51.050> goes<00:06:51.230> down

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
gets shot his health obviously goes down

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.710 
gets shot his health obviously goes down
and<00:06:51.710> once<00:06:51.920> he<00:06:52.040> gets<00:06:52.220> critically<00:06:52.850> wounded<00:06:53.210> down

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.080 
and once he gets critically wounded down
to<00:06:53.900> 65<00:06:54.440> or<00:06:54.650> less<00:06:54.800> health<00:06:55.070> or<00:06:55.280> 85<00:06:55.760> in<00:06:55.940> some

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
instances his suit does give a very

instances his suit does give a very
violent<00:07:00.020> shake<00:07:00.440> and<00:07:00.680> seems<00:07:01.010> like<00:07:01.160> it's

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
violent shake and seems like it's

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.580 
violent shake and seems like it's
knocked<00:07:01.610> out<00:07:01.850> of<00:07:02.000> its<00:07:02.150> its<00:07:02.570> flight<00:07:02.990> patterns<00:07:03.440> I

knocked out of its its flight patterns I

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.380 
knocked out of its its flight patterns I
don't<00:07:03.770> know<00:07:03.860> if<00:07:03.980> that's<00:07:04.190> going<00:07:04.850> to<00:07:04.940> remain<00:07:05.240> in

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
don't know if that's going to remain in

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.910 
don't know if that's going to remain in
the<00:07:05.480> game<00:07:05.630> or<00:07:05.810> if<00:07:05.870> that's<00:07:06.050> just<00:07:06.320> his<00:07:06.470> timing<00:07:06.860> of

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
the game or if that's just his timing of

the game or if that's just his timing of
the<00:07:07.040> videos<00:07:07.340> but<00:07:07.970> just<00:07:08.360> some<00:07:08.480> cool<00:07:08.660> stuff<00:07:08.780> I've
