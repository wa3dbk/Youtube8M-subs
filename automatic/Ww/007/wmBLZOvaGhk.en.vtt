00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.200
 today I present you a 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.130
 japanese of 1963 it's a kawa there was 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.890
 70 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.750
 So here it is in these old one 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.040
 only micro and a species it's a 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.390
 kind of shorts what she does because 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.460
 that she is enough is still gone 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.559
 small but a wide enough handle 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.610
 here and so not seen that only one microphone 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.610
 neck pickup 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.660
 for me 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590
 m 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.730
 what are you 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.900
 but no 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.270
 but 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.490
 m 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 and well that's pretty surprising when 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.000
 even in saturation 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.000
 it's a good little guitar 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 nice
