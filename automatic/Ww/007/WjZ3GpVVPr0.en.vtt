this<00:02:37.109> card<00:02:37.379> is<00:02:37.470> very<00:02:37.680> very<00:02:37.859> good<00:02:38.069> I've<00:02:38.310> had<00:02:38.459> a

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
this card is very very good I've had a

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.069 
this card is very very good I've had a
lot<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.760> fun<00:02:38.940> with<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> andre<00:02:39.420> johnson<00:02:39.659> card

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
but in all honesty i think this one is
even<00:02:42.120> better<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.049> I'm<00:02:43.140> definitely<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.560> be

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
even better so I'm definitely to be

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.020 
even better so I'm definitely to be
making<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.010> run<00:02:44.280> at<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.489> collection

edition cards personally I'm still

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.039 
edition cards personally I'm still
hoping<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.639> Tony<00:03:42.000> Romo<00:03:42.359> final<00:03:42.750> edition

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
hoping for a Tony Romo final edition

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.860 
hoping for a Tony Romo final edition
card<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.440> highly<00:03:44.040> doubt<00:03:44.250> that'll<00:03:44.609> happen<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
card I highly doubt that'll happen but I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.420 
card I highly doubt that'll happen but I
am<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> Cowboys<00:03:46.440> fan<00:03:46.470> if<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.859> guys<00:03:46.980> didn't<00:03:47.280> know

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
am a Cowboys fan if you guys didn't know

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.759 
am a Cowboys fan if you guys didn't know
and<00:03:47.669> I<00:03:47.730> thought<00:03:48.629> Tony<00:03:48.900> Romo<00:03:49.139> had<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.290> fantastic

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and I thought Tony Romo had a fantastic

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.789 
and I thought Tony Romo had a fantastic
year<00:03:50.069> overall<00:03:50.629> obviously<00:03:51.629> he<00:03:52.440> had<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> few

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
year overall obviously he had a few

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.069 
year overall obviously he had a few
mistakes<00:03:52.949> but<00:03:53.340> overall<00:03:53.819> stat<00:03:54.449> wise<00:03:54.659> he<00:03:54.959> had

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
mistakes but overall stat wise he had

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.149 
mistakes but overall stat wise he had
probably<00:03:55.260> one<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> best<00:03:55.709> years<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:56.069> his

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
probably one of the best years of his

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.009 
probably one of the best years of his
career<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.120> would<00:03:57.359> love<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.629> see<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> Tony

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
career so I would love to see a Tony

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.050 
career so I would love to see a Tony
Romo<00:03:58.260> final<00:03:58.620> edition<00:03:58.980> even<00:03:59.879> though<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
Romo final edition even though the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.369 
Romo final edition even though the
community<00:04:00.480> would<00:04:00.569> probably<00:04:00.870> blow<00:04:01.049> up<00:04:01.199> if<00:04:01.349> he

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
community would probably blow up if he

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.649 
community would probably blow up if he
