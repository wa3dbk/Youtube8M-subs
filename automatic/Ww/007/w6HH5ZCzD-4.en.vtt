it's good juices inside here and you rub
it<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.110> don't<00:01:50.260> go<00:01:50.380> rubbing<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.799> in

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
it on so don't go rubbing it in

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.350 
it on so don't go rubbing it in
you<00:01:51.159> don't<00:01:51.280> rub<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.610> put<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.180> mean

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
you don't rub it in you put it on I mean

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.969 
you don't rub it in you put it on I mean
so<00:01:52.900> this<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.140> guess<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.380> have<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.560> rub<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.830> in

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.670 
so this I guess you have to rub it in
