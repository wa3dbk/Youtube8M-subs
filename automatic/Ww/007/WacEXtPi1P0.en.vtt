00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
but once you get used to using this kill

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.630 
but once you get used to using this kill
streak<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.620> do<00:02:57.680> some<00:02:57.859> serious<00:02:58.069> work<00:02:58.280> you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
streak you can do some serious work you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.220 
streak you can do some serious work you
can<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:58.910> serious<00:02:59.060> work<00:02:59.299> with<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.720> inside<00:03:00.079> of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
can do serious work with the inside of

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.180 
can do serious work with the inside of
buildings<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.940> outside<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:03.739> just<00:03:03.950> takes<00:03:04.099> a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
buildings and outside so it just takes a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.030 
buildings and outside so it just takes a
little<00:03:04.310> while<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.640> get<00:03:04.730> used<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.030> using<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.480> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
little while to get used to using it and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.319 
little while to get used to using it and
once<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.220> do<00:03:07.430> you'll<00:03:07.700> probably<00:03:07.970> find<00:03:08.180> that

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
once you do you'll probably find that

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.170 
once you do you'll probably find that
you<00:03:08.480> can<00:03:08.599> get<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.989> good<00:03:09.319> six<00:03:10.250> seven<00:03:10.579> kills<00:03:10.910> on

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
you can get a good six seven kills on

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.759 
you can get a good six seven kills on
the<00:03:11.480> average<00:03:11.629> I<00:03:11.870> mean<00:03:12.019> I've<00:03:12.410> already<00:03:12.530> gotten

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
the average I mean I've already gotten

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.110 
the average I mean I've already gotten
like<00:03:12.950> seven<00:03:13.220> or<00:03:13.280> eight<00:03:13.370> kills<00:03:13.609> on<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.910> thing

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
like seven or eight kills on this thing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.059 
like seven or eight kills on this thing
and<00:03:14.329> if<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:16.609> just<00:03:16.849> takes<00:03:16.970> some<00:03:17.090> practice<00:03:17.269> so

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
and if it it just takes some practice so

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.039 
and if it it just takes some practice so
outside<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:19.569> you<00:03:20.569> can<00:03:20.750> chain<00:03:21.019> this

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
outside of this you can chain this

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.150 
outside of this you can chain this
together<00:03:21.440> with<00:03:21.769> some<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.040> higher

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
together with some of the higher

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.099 
together with some of the higher
killstreaks<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:22.880> for<00:03:23.060> instance<00:03:23.150> here<00:03:23.900> we<00:03:23.989> go

pilot so the advice that I have for the
helo<00:03:44.040> pilot<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:45.000> stay<00:03:45.330> kind<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.080> on<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.230> edges

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
helo pilot is stay kind of on the edges

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.930 
helo pilot is stay kind of on the edges
or<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.890> outside<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> map<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.760> shoot

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
or the outside of the map and shoot

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.870 
or the outside of the map and shoot
towards<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.450> middle<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:50.430> doesn't<00:03:50.730> work

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
towards the middle now it doesn't work

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.700 
towards the middle now it doesn't work
always<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.630> really<00:03:52.020> kind<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.260> depends<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
always it really kind of depends on the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.160 
always it really kind of depends on the
map<00:03:52.830> here<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.850> on<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.420> on<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.810> map<00:03:54.960> like
