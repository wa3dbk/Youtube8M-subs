a mid-level attachment point or slightly
lower<00:00:17.270> you're<00:00:17.840> going<00:00:17.960> to<00:00:18.020> take<00:00:18.200> both<00:00:18.440> handles

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
lower you're going to take both handles

in one hand you're going to stand away
until<00:00:21.170> you've<00:00:21.350> got<00:00:21.380> quite<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.800> bit<00:00:21.950> of

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
until you've got quite a bit of

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.010 
until you've got quite a bit of
resistance<00:00:22.340> on<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.700> band's<00:00:23.090> here<00:00:23.300> now<00:00:23.840> what

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
resistance on the band's here now what

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.210 
resistance on the band's here now what
we're<00:00:24.170> going<00:00:24.290> to<00:00:24.380> do<00:00:24.500> here<00:00:24.530> is<00:00:24.800> we're<00:00:24.950> going<00:00:25.070> to

and then rotate our torso slightly so
there's<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.630> lot<00:00:32.750> of<00:00:32.810> different<00:00:32.900> things<00:00:33.290> going

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
there's a lot of different things going

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.170 
there's a lot of different things going
on<00:00:33.680> here<00:00:33.920> first<00:00:34.490> of<00:00:34.670> all<00:00:34.730> we're<00:00:34.910> hitting<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
on here first of all we're hitting the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.819 
on here first of all we're hitting the
entire<00:00:35.540> lower<00:00:35.750> body<00:00:35.840> going<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.590> tone<00:00:36.800> and

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
entire lower body going to tone and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.380 
entire lower body going to tone and

tighten your legs and your butt your
calves<00:00:38.720> of<00:00:38.900> course<00:00:39.170> but<00:00:39.710> then<00:00:39.829> as<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:40.190> come<00:00:40.370> up

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
calves of course but then as we come up

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.580 
calves of course but then as we come up
and<00:00:40.790> we<00:00:40.970> pull<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.450> band<00:00:41.660> in<00:00:41.930> we're<00:00:42.530> actually

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
and we pull the band in we're actually

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.410 
and we pull the band in we're actually
going<00:00:42.829> to<00:00:42.920> pull<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.310> shoulders<00:00:43.670> back<00:00:43.700> we're

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
going to pull the shoulders back we're

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.060 
going to pull the shoulders back we're
going<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.600> lift<00:00:44.810> up<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.170> breast<00:00:45.410> there<00:00:45.710> and

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
going to lift up the breast there and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.410 
going to lift up the breast there and
then<00:00:46.160> we're<00:00:46.280> also<00:00:46.460> going<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:46.940> get<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.239> little

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
then we're also going to get a little

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.970 
then we're also going to get a little
bit<00:00:47.630> of<00:00:47.690> rotation<00:00:47.810> in<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:48.530> that's<00:00:48.680> going<00:00:48.890> to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
bit of rotation in and that's going to

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.290 
bit of rotation in and that's going to
bring<00:00:49.130> in<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.370> abdominal<00:00:49.610> muscles<00:00:50.000> as<00:00:50.270> well

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
bring in the abdominal muscles as well

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.549 
bring in the abdominal muscles as well
so<00:00:50.690> you're<00:00:50.840> actually<00:00:50.960> going<00:00:51.200> to<00:00:51.260> lift<00:00:51.470> the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
so you're actually going to lift the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.020 
so you're actually going to lift the
breast<00:00:51.680> you're<00:00:52.250> going<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.430> tighten<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:52.850> tone

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
breast you're going to tighten and tone

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.729 
breast you're going to tighten and tone
your<00:00:53.090> midsection<00:00:53.630> going<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.410> tighten<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
your midsection going to tighten the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.920 
your midsection going to tighten the
button<00:00:55.040> tone<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.340> butt<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.730> also<00:00:56.239> slim<00:00:56.809> out

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
button tone the butt and also slim out

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.510 
button tone the butt and also slim out
the<00:00:57.050> leg<00:00:57.200> so<00:00:57.410> basically<00:00:57.829> we're<00:00:57.980> hitting<00:00:58.190> every

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
the leg so basically we're hitting every

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.370 
the leg so basically we're hitting every
major<00:00:58.730> muscle<00:00:58.940> group<00:00:59.180> here<00:00:59.540> for<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.110> full

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
major muscle group here for that full

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.740 
major muscle group here for that full
body<00:01:00.590> exercise<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:01.610> this<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:02.450> how<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.719> looks

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
body exercise so this is how it looks

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.570 
body exercise so this is how it looks
you<00:01:03.050> put<00:01:03.260> your<00:01:03.380> other<00:01:03.530> hand<00:01:03.649> behind<00:01:04.070> your<00:01:04.400> back

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
you put your other hand behind your back

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.130 
you put your other hand behind your back
you<00:01:04.879> squat<00:01:05.810> down<00:01:06.110> stand<00:01:07.100> up<00:01:07.400> pull<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.479> rotate

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
you squat down stand up pull and rotate

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.200 
you squat down stand up pull and rotate
slightly<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.130> you're<00:01:10.610> going<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.790> do<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:10.970> all

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
slightly and you're going to do this all

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.850 
slightly and you're going to do this all
in<00:01:11.240> one<00:01:11.540> motion<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.229> here's<00:01:12.440> what<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.680> looks

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
in one motion so here's what it looks

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:30.429 
in one motion so here's what it looks
like<00:01:13.010> now<00:01:27.850> for<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.909> opposite<00:01:29.330> side<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.780> switch

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
like now for the opposite side to switch

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.219 
like now for the opposite side to switch
hands<00:01:30.890> other<00:01:31.549> arm<00:01:31.850> goes<00:01:32.000> behind<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.420> back<00:01:32.510> and

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
hands other arm goes behind the back and

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.130 
hands other arm goes behind the back and
continue<00:01:33.860> on
