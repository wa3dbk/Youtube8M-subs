about<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.260> overall<00:00:37.440> experience<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:38.129> this

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
about just my overall experience in this

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.619 
about just my overall experience in this
company<00:00:38.579> which<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.300> positive

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
company which was not positive

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.990 
company which was not positive
whatsoever<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.100> guess<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> before<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
whatsoever so I guess it before this is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.920 
whatsoever so I guess it before this is
the<00:00:42.379> 7.5<00:00:43.379> inch<00:00:43.680> stainless<00:00:44.160> steel<00:00:44.539> it<00:00:45.539> has<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the 7.5 inch stainless steel it has that

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
the 7.5 inch stainless steel it has that
nitride<00:00:46.410> coating<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.890> did<00:00:47.100> some<00:00:47.250> research<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
nitride coating I did some research and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
nitride coating I did some research and
asked<00:00:47.969> some<00:00:48.059> friends<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.079> sounds<00:00:49.410> like

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
asked some friends and it sounds like

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
asked some friends and it sounds like
that<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.430> pretty<00:00:50.700> durable<00:00:50.940> coating<00:00:51.180> that's

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that is a pretty durable coating that's

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
that is a pretty durable coating that's
gonna<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> new<00:00:52.020> thing<00:00:52.350> hopefully<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:53.280> do

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
gonna be the new thing hopefully they do

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
gonna be the new thing hopefully they do
so<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.149> stainless<00:00:54.539> steel<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so just a stainless steel and just a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
so just a stainless steel and just a
nitride<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> believe<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> combination

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
nitride I believe this is a combination

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.750 
nitride I believe this is a combination
of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> best<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.100> both<00:00:59.250> worlds<00:00:59.280> your

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

of the best of both worlds your
stainless<00:01:00.059> steel<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.840> nitride<00:01:01.199> coating

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
stainless steel and your nitride coating

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
stainless steel and your nitride coating
these<00:01:02.489> barrels<00:01:02.910> come<00:01:03.239> from<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> Green

over at Minuteman munitions about twist

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.620 
over at Minuteman munitions about twist
rates<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.189> sounds<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> barrel<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.329> short

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
rates it sounds like a barrel this short

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
rates it sounds like a barrel this short
twist<00:01:46.380> rate<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.710> doesn't<00:01:47.070> matter<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
twist rate really doesn't matter if you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
twist rate really doesn't matter if you
get<00:01:48.210> above<00:01:48.509> 10<00:01:48.840> inches<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.740> need<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
get above 10 inches then you do need to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.200 
get above 10 inches then you do need to
be<00:01:50.100> concerned<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.700> twist<00:01:50.970> rate<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
be concerned about what twist rate you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.670 
be concerned about what twist rate you
