or anything like that so it is a nice

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
or anything like that so it is a nice
way<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> install<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> case<00:01:08.939> right<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.420> where

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
way to install a case right here where

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.500 
way to install a case right here where
my<00:01:09.900> finger<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> rubberized<00:01:11.670> insert

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
my finger is this is a rubberized insert

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.499 
my finger is this is a rubberized insert
so<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.770> permanently<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.240> glued

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so it's permanently in there it's glued

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
so it's permanently in there it's glued
in<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.790> only

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
in there and it's good because not only

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
in there and it's good because not only
is<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> protect<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.869> phone<00:01:19.189> when

it's<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.909> case<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> drop<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's in this case but if you drop this

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's in this case but if you drop this
case<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:24.240> actually<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> absorb<00:01:24.930> some

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
case it's actually going to absorb some

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.120 
case it's actually going to absorb some
shock<00:01:25.759> or<00:01:26.759> impact<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.950> how

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
at about 4 ounces now when I put the

will add about an ounce of weight to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.319 
will add about an ounce of weight to
your<00:02:02.850> iPhone<00:02:03.509> 5s<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.030> that's<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.180> we're

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
your iPhone 5s so that's what we're

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.479 
your iPhone 5s so that's what we're
talking<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:07.110> let's<00:02:07.770> look<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
talking about there let's look at the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.949 
talking about there let's look at the
back<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.970> case<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.599> really

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
back of this case because it's really

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.869 
back of this case because it's really
really<00:02:10.410> pretty<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.250> take<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> look<00:02:11.550> down

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
really pretty as you take a look down

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.670 
really pretty as you take a look down
below<00:02:12.300> you've<00:02:12.870> got<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.319> bro

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
below you've got that bro

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.520 
below you've got that bro
aluminum<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.629> rosewood<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.349> my

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
aluminum here is the rosewood in my

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.199 
aluminum here is the rosewood in my
instance<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.549> real<00:02:17.849> exotic

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
instance and that's all real exotic

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.059 
instance and that's all real exotic
hardwood<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.049> again<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.319> think<00:02:19.680> part<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
hardwood and again I think part of the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.729 
hardwood and again I think part of the
weight<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.519> because<00:02:20.969> of<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.780> real<00:02:22.019> woods<00:02:22.349> here

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
weight is because of the real woods here

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.740 
weight is because of the real woods here
