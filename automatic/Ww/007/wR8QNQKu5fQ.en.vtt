00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.039 
well CPM is the amount of money you make
for<00:02:59.580> every<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> thousand<00:03:00.180> easy<00:03:00.330> get<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.599> youtube

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
for every a thousand easy get on youtube

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.580 
for every a thousand easy get on youtube
so<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.890> between<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:03.030> that's<00:03:03.630> what<00:03:03.870> how<00:03:04.410> much

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
so in between this that's what how much

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.039 
so in between this that's what how much
the<00:03:04.830> optic<00:03:05.190> nadeshot<00:03:05.310> should<00:03:05.760> make<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.209> if

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
the optic nadeshot should make so if

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.210 
the optic nadeshot should make so if
you're<00:03:07.260> trying<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.500> get<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.769> through<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> range

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you're trying to get it through a range

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.100 
you're trying to get it through a range
of<00:03:08.340> social<00:03:08.519> blade<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.150> socially<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.810> huge

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
of social blade and socially is a huge

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.600 
of social blade and socially is a huge
range<00:03:10.349> i'm<00:03:10.530> gonna<00:03:10.680> break<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:10.860> down<00:03:11.099> into<00:03:11.370> what

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
range i'm gonna break it down into what

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.910 
range i'm gonna break it down into what
i<00:03:11.760> think<00:03:12.180> he<00:03:12.540> has<00:03:12.630> made<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:12.989> youtube<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
i think he has made it from youtube it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.140 
i think he has made it from youtube it
should<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.220> right<00:03:14.430> down<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.790> middle<00:03:14.819> so

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
should be right down in the middle so

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.630 
should be right down in the middle so
you<00:03:15.180> may<00:03:15.390> might<00:03:15.870> be<00:03:15.989> making<00:03:16.350> around<00:03:16.640> 500-600

feeling that he makes around six dollars

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.219 
feeling that he makes around six dollars
for<00:04:13.769> every<00:04:13.799> thousand<00:04:14.370> views<00:04:14.489> he<00:04:14.579> gets<00:04:14.760> on

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
for every thousand views he gets on

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.710 
for every thousand views he gets on
youtube<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:16.500> his<00:04:17.010> CPM<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.729> six<00:04:18.030> dollars<00:04:18.209> so

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
youtube so his CPM is six dollars so

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.240 
youtube so his CPM is six dollars so
what<00:04:18.989> am<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.200> gonna<00:04:19.320> do<00:04:19.560> right<00:04:19.799> now<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.010> I'm

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
what am I gonna do right now is I'm

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.890 
what am I gonna do right now is I'm
gonna<00:04:20.370> take<00:04:20.549> his<00:04:20.849> total<00:04:21.299> amount<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.599> video

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
gonna take his total amount of video

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.390 
gonna take his total amount of video
views<00:04:22.490> times

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.430

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
dividing it by a thousand is because a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.430 
dividing it by a thousand is because a
thousand<00:04:28.750> views<00:04:28.930> equals<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.470> CPM<00:04:30.009> so<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.550> have

thousand views equals the CPM so I have

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.969

confused<00:04:58.720> now<00:04:59.530> the<00:05:00.100> reason<00:05:00.250> why<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.520> feel<00:05:01.030> like

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
confused now the reason why I feel like

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.850 
confused now the reason why I feel like
that<00:05:01.330> he<00:05:01.600> has<00:05:01.720> made<00:05:01.960> this<00:05:02.169> is<00:05:02.350> because<00:05:02.650> of<00:05:02.680> the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
that he has made this is because of the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.430 
that he has made this is because of the
fact<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.250> six<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> high<00:05:04.510> C<00:05:04.780> p.m.<00:05:05.139> but<00:05:05.410> he

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
fact that six is a high C p.m. but he

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.439 
fact that six is a high C p.m. but he
could<00:05:05.650> possibly<00:05:06.070> get<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.280> higher<00:05:06.550> CPM<00:05:06.850> because

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
could possibly get a higher CPM because

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.140 
could possibly get a higher CPM because
of<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.630> fact<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:08.050> we<00:05:08.740> don't<00:05:08.889> know<00:05:09.130> his<00:05:09.639> CPM

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
of the fact that we don't know his CPM

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.029 
of the fact that we don't know his CPM
I'm<00:05:10.389> an<00:05:10.570> eight<00:05:10.780> shot<00:05:11.080> at<00:05:11.260> my<00:05:11.560> major<00:05:11.919> league

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
I'm an eight shot at my major league

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.010 
I'm an eight shot at my major league
gaming<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.639> didn't<00:05:12.970> make<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.180> contract<00:05:13.870> for

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
gaming I didn't make that contract for

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.719 
gaming I didn't make that contract for
him<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.260> didn't<00:05:14.530> sign<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.919> contract<00:05:15.370> for<00:05:15.550> him

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
him I didn't sign the contract for him

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.909 
him I didn't sign the contract for him
so<00:05:16.270> he<00:05:16.300> could<00:05:16.660> be<00:05:16.780> possibly<00:05:17.169> making<00:05:17.440> more

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
so he could be possibly making more

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.490 
so he could be possibly making more
