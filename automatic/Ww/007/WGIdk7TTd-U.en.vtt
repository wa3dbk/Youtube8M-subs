00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.049
 back for them the night of August 12th that later we will do it on a more 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.639
 down that earth started by buying the right away at chicago bulls do 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.669
 on one of my tracks 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.139
 for some yes what is a blue joke it's an old big recovery 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:13.999
 bill broonzy 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.240
 % so start their soil 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.360
 the lowest run down the subway for the street where he plays a time 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.910
 blocked for one year at the water level during the first four measures so we go 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.560
 let go of the first reason that still remains a little bit in a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 piece and we will attack at the beginning of the second half 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.070
 if the file 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 - but no 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 but the real 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.220
 the Madrilenians 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 rome 25 months 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.380
 ban ki-moon 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 maurice vincent lavoie 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
 blur 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.460
 good of m 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 the dmla 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 see 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 form 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 because the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.420
 ok so he listened 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.560
 perhaps the simplest is to try to find demons save 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.740
 blues 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.119
 yet we find quite easily anyway on twelve measures then 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 this piece there a particularity there is what is called an elbow I did not manage 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.800
 quick changes 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.120
 it's a little bit the same scene but it's sure that I'm going to 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.810
 will present talk% it just means that the second measure 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.330
 both strange iron floor sol 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.170
 alone on the professional scene 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.310
 this is this time if we do this for its very bosom of change 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.559
 especially for singing which is still more practical 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 so reach in this case me the harmonica we can stay 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.340
 the console all the time on these cases first measure it's not it's not 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.949
 embarrassing 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.389
 between humor and we find ourselves a little compared to May
