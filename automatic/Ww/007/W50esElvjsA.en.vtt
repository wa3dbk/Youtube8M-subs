so<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.790> guys<00:01:30.439> small<00:01:31.439> handle<00:01:32.720> can<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.750> kept

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so these guys small handle can be kept

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.730 
so these guys small handle can be kept
in<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:35.040> much<00:01:35.159> anything<00:01:35.930> from<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.110> top<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.619> an

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
in pretty much anything from a top to an

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.810 
in pretty much anything from a top to an
enclosure<00:01:38.420> terrarium<00:01:39.420> whatever<00:01:40.520> whatever<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
enclosure terrarium whatever whatever it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.160 
enclosure terrarium whatever whatever it
is<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> keep<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.810> there

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
is you can keep it in there

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
is you can keep it in there
obviously<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.040> limitations<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
obviously there's some limitations to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
obviously there's some limitations to
that<00:01:45.060> though<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:47.130> whatever

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that though so it's not really whatever

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.230 
that though so it's not really whatever
it<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.970> oh<00:01:48.439> we're<00:01:49.439> gonna<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.770> into

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
tall that's plain enough to keep me sort

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.949 
tall that's plain enough to keep me sort
of<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.770> single<00:02:08.280> adult<00:02:08.640> male<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.720> you're

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
of this single adult male if you're

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.020 
of this single adult male if you're
going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> second<00:02:11.250> one<00:02:11.459> I'd<00:02:11.730> say

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
going to go for a second one I'd say

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.759 
going to go for a second one I'd say
four<00:02:12.480> foot<00:02:12.780> by<00:02:12.989> four

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
four foot by four

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.410 
four foot by four
to<00:02:14.769> football<00:02:15.010> night<00:02:15.519> you'd<00:02:15.730> still<00:02:16.030> only<00:02:16.180> need

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
to football night you'd still only need

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.849 
to football night you'd still only need
one<00:02:16.629> foot<00:02:16.870> tall<00:02:17.079> because<00:02:17.349> they're<00:02:17.500> not<00:02:17.620> really

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
one foot tall because they're not really

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.849 
one foot tall because they're not really
climbers<00:02:19.530> okay

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
climbers okay

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:25.910 
climbers okay
now<00:02:22.200> temperatures<00:02:23.200> between<00:02:24.099> 25<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:24.909> 30

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
now temperatures between 25 and 30

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.470 
now temperatures between 25 and 30
pretty<00:02:26.920> simple

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
pretty simple

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.349 
pretty simple
mine<00:02:29.319> is<00:02:29.590> between<00:02:30.099> 25<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:32.549> 33<00:02:33.549> just<00:02:34.090> because

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
mine is between 25 and 33 just because

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.080 
mine is between 25 and 33 just because
matches<00:02:34.750> their<00:02:34.989> temperatures<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:36.250> my<00:02:36.519> area<00:02:36.879> so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
matches their temperatures of my area so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.140 
matches their temperatures of my area so
it's<00:02:37.390> pretty<00:02:37.540> much<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.590> keep<00:02:38.799> them<00:02:39.150> still

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
it's pretty much I can keep them still

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.789 
it's pretty much I can keep them still
room<00:02:40.359> temperature<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.750> see<00:02:43.989> he's

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
room temperature you can see he's

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.020 
room temperature you can see he's
grabbing<00:02:45.159> onto<00:02:45.310> my<00:02:45.489> shirt<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.849> everything

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
grabbing onto my shirt and everything

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.149 
grabbing onto my shirt and everything
because<00:02:46.569> these<00:02:46.750> snakes<00:02:47.139> need<00:02:47.409> more<00:02:47.889> body

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
because these snakes need more body

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.780 
because these snakes need more body
support<00:02:48.639> because<00:02:48.909> their<00:02:49.120> terrestrial<00:02:50.790> then

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
support because their terrestrial then
