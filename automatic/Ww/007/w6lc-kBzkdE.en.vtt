00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.270
 just with a sentence yes there led with 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.550
 some kind of request and with a small 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.230

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.980
 holiday of some kind of miracle performance 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 Naturally, everyone waits for desires 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.250
 gifts 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.510

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.289
 some kind of all kinds of toys 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.239
 devices 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.590
 phones computer equipment something else 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.690
 but residents 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.850
 novorosii and for example the same city 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.710
 May Day waiting for the opportunity just 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.020
 survive and at least be warm and 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.490
 security today is the city of pervomaisk 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.689
 Essentially, this is Leningrad of times under blockade. 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.969
 years of the Great Patriotic War 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.880
 this is the city in which people get in 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.439
 ration quality is only 250 grams of bread 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 day and nothing else with this they 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.459
 are under blows hail prim 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.740
 direct shelling of the Ukrainian 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:30.130
 punitive artillery and naturally 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.399
 constant shelling we know that here 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.919
 how would there be such fashionable devices as 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.569
 for example, there is an iphone, but here it is 

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.399
 the usual background just recently I had 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.439
 birthday so it happened that three 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.060
 for some reason my friends decided to help me 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.209
 upgrade your phone and each one gave 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.049
 on iphone today she has three iphone 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.289
 good device yes that is 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.409
 there is an interesting thing with a bunch of frills 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.060
 and all sorts of functions but it 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.979
 important are these functions in terms of 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.709
 opportunities to survive for example in novorosii 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.479
 I understand that for the new year many in that 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.219
 same Moscow and St. Petersburg or other peaceful 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.510
 cities want to get something like that 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.979
 but if 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.030
 compare this same this phone yes 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.670
 this iphone 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.250
 directly with the bread that's it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.800
 such a spider in 250 grams get residents 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.400
 May Day during the day in the cold 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.290
 winter cold winter and nothing else we 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.900
 We see that the iphone in the box will give with all 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.710
 your device weighs exactly that much 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.490
 how many 250 grams of bread would seem that 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.230
 common here yes but actually if you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.360
 take part before that is help us 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 sell this iphone tus 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.640
 I decided to change these iPhones to 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.080
 flour because of this flour will 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.050
 bakes bread that will be fed 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.060
 residents of Pervomaiska weight is the same but 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.400
 the price is completely different because the price 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.990
 this bread is the price of this life though 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.730
 Of course the flour in the store is much 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.240
 cheaper than iphone 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.730
 so I announce the starting price for 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.020
 iphone 5s here's a nice wonderful 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.470
 so golden to 2 tons two tons 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.110
 flour or 30,000 rubles and a fire and one step 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.310
 in the auction is one bag of flour 50 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.770
 kilogram or 750 rubles for my pages 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.440
 in social networks I declare bargaining penal servitude 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.060
 sort of auction and ask you to do 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.970
 such a purchase is natural this purchase 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.530
 will be more expensive than any 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.530
 online store but this purchase will be 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.590
 much more expensive and price me in the sense that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.810
 are you still making this purchase to participate 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.590
 in the auction save the lives of ordinary people I 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.660
 I really hope that we can collect 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.680
 more money and flour for 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.810
 to feed 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.480
 these these people but everyone else 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.000

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.050

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.760
 residents of Pervomaisk 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.100
 food and everything you need 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.360
 because of the 80 thousand inhabitants on 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.050
 today is left there 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.230
 25-30 thousand people are these people 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.450
 mine just you conditions them i 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.040

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.870
 that always happens that always comes true 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.410
 I really hope that at least the price of these 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.120
 three iPhones will be equal to the price of salvation 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.609

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.090

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.190
 and system along with you provide 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.900
 help these people and save them from in 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.270
