00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
piece after 125 kills I think it's about
a<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.730> did<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.060> close

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
a time I get one and I did not close

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
a time I get one and I did not close
this<00:00:27.720> interface<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.769> five<00:00:29.070> minutes<00:00:29.279> or

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this interface for like five minutes or

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.450 
this interface for like five minutes or
something<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.660> looking<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
something I was just looking at that you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
something I was just looking at that you
know<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.850> admiring<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:34.380> piece<00:00:34.680> right

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
know just admiring that like piece right

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.790 
know just admiring that like piece right
here<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.540> hope<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.020> next<00:00:37.290> piece<00:00:37.500> does

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
here so I hope that the next piece does

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.660 
here so I hope that the next piece does
not<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.399> long<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.559> 125<00:00:40.559> yeah<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
not take as long because 125 yeah it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
not take as long because 125 yeah it
equals<00:00:42.030> approximately<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:43.050> month<00:00:43.260> however<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
equals approximately one month however I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.670 
equals approximately one month however I
think<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.480> found<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.050> make<00:00:46.469> everything

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
think I found a way to make everything

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.040 
think I found a way to make everything
much<00:00:47.219> faster<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> next<00:00:48.480> leg<00:00:48.809> pieces

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
much faster I think the next leg pieces

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
much faster I think the next leg pieces
are<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> come<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.039> me<00:00:50.190> much<00:00:50.399> faster<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
are going to come to me much faster of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.139 
are going to come to me much faster of
course<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.680> gonna<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.100> terribly<00:00:53.850> dry

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
course if I'm not gonna get terribly dry

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840 
course if I'm not gonna get terribly dry
so<00:00:54.960> usually<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.469> kill<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.890> our<00:00:56.129> axes<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> day

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so usually I kill for our axes a day

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
so usually I kill for our axes a day
which<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.480> much<00:00:57.960> my<00:00:58.170> limit<00:00:58.530> unless<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
which is pretty much my limit unless I

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.400 
which is pretty much my limit unless I
want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> use<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.030> Salomon<00:01:00.600> Bruce<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
want to use some Salomon Bruce then I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.439 
want to use some Salomon Bruce then I
could<00:01:01.680> kill<00:01:01.859> maybe<00:01:02.190> seven<00:01:02.640> well<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.210> could

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
could kill maybe seven well I could

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
could kill maybe seven well I could
actually<00:01:03.690> kill<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.549> know

penance<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.149> instead<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.979> again<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.340> kill

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
penance all instead and again I can kill

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.499 
penance all instead and again I can kill
9<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.030> day<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> future<00:01:54.479> I

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
9 a day now now you know in the future I

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
9 a day now now you know in the future I
may<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.930> kill<00:01:55.140> 9<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> day<00:01:55.710> because<00:01:55.950> today<00:01:56.130> was

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
may not kill 9 a day because today was

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510 
may not kill 9 a day because today was
actually<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> very<00:01:57.630> easy<00:01:57.960> path<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.009> first<00:01:59.250> path

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
actually a very easy path the first path

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
actually a very easy path the first path
was<00:01:59.820> blocked<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.840> middle<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> shadow

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
was blocked and the middle and shadow

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.399 
was blocked and the middle and shadow
paths<00:02:02.159> were<00:02:02.520> opened<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.479> are<00:02:03.750> probably

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
paths were opened so those are probably

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.260 
paths were opened so those are probably
the<00:02:04.829> easiest<00:02:04.860> ones<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.119> have

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the easiest ones because you don't have

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479 
the easiest ones because you don't have
to<00:02:06.390> kill<00:02:06.600> any<00:02:06.810> minions<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.770> yeah<00:02:07.890> combine<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
to kill any minions so yeah combine that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.910 
to kill any minions so yeah combine that
with<00:02:08.550> onyx<00:02:09.119> bolts<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.140> kill<00:02:10.379> 9<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.770> them

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
with onyx bolts and I can kill 9 of them

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.790 
with onyx bolts and I can kill 9 of them
a<00:02:11.039> day<00:02:11.220> without<00:02:11.670> using<00:02:12.599> any<00:02:12.870> Sodom<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.440> Peru

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
a day without using any Sodom in Peru

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
a day without using any Sodom in Peru
though<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:14.610> at<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:14.790> point<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.450> drank<00:02:15.750> like

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
though I think at one point I drank like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.310 
though I think at one point I drank like
two<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.470> them<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.490> combine<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.090> with

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
two of them but if I combine this with

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.530 
two of them but if I combine this with
vampirism<00:02:19.320> autumn<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.250> kill<00:02:20.460> even<00:02:20.640> more<00:02:21.000> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
vampirism autumn I can kill even more so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.050 
vampirism autumn I can kill even more so
yeah<00:02:21.720> for<00:02:21.960> upcoming<00:02:22.320> three<00:02:23.310> days<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.820> will<00:02:24.030> be

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060

yeah for upcoming three days I will be
able<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.570> kill<00:02:24.780> probably<00:02:25.620> 27<00:02:26.100> more<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.150> that's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
able to kill probably 27 more so that's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.000 
able to kill probably 27 more so that's
a<00:02:27.480> high<00:02:27.630> chance<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.080> receiving<00:02:28.440> another

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010

a high chance of receiving another
weapon<00:02:29.310> piece<00:02:30.230> yeah<00:02:31.230> hopefully<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.760> the
