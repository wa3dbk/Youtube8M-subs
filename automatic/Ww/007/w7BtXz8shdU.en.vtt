range<00:00:12.510> today<00:00:13.510> I<00:00:13.570> want<00:00:14.290> to<00:00:14.469> address<00:00:14.740> I<00:00:15.400> guess<00:00:16.119> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
range today I want to address I guess a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.040 
range today I want to address I guess a
statement<00:00:18.880> is<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.150> where<00:00:19.449> we<00:00:19.600> are<00:00:19.630> with<00:00:19.990> a

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
statement is to where we are with a

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.990 
statement is to where we are with a
third<00:00:20.230> swing<00:00:20.529> versus<00:00:20.980> say<00:00:21.190> the<00:00:21.640> rest<00:00:21.820> of<00:00:21.940> the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
third swing versus say the rest of the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.179 
third swing versus say the rest of the
world<00:00:22.180> of<00:00:22.300> rotational<00:00:22.779> swing<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.259> I<00:00:23.980> think

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
world of rotational swing and I think

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.470 
world of rotational swing and I think
any<00:00:24.490> of<00:00:24.580> you<00:00:24.699> that's<00:00:24.849> been<00:00:25.000> here<00:00:25.150> long<00:00:25.330> enough

on this website knows that that

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.380 
on this website knows that that
basically<00:00:29.369> search<00:00:30.369> wing<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:30.820> three-quarter

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
basically search wing is a three-quarter

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.170 
basically search wing is a three-quarter
limited<00:00:31.779> turn<00:00:31.990> swing<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.619> as<00:00:33.579> far<00:00:33.790> as<00:00:34.000> what

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
limited turn swing and as far as what

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.670 
limited turn swing and as far as what
the<00:00:34.329> predominance<00:00:34.960> of<00:00:35.079> instruction<00:00:35.590> in<00:00:35.650> the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the predominance of instruction in the

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
world is is rotational swing I mean

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.630 
world is is rotational swing I mean
basically<00:00:38.290> probably<00:00:38.980> ninety<00:00:39.430> five<00:00:39.580> percent

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
gets to vertical in the follow-through

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.660 
gets to vertical in the follow-through
okay<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.079> what<00:01:29.619> he's<00:01:29.799> talking<00:01:30.130> about<00:01:30.189> here

back to impact we swing into the forward
catches<00:01:39.609> mint<00:01:39.819> and<00:01:40.030> up<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.270> treat<00:01:40.509> vertical

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
catches mint and up to treat vertical

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.529 
catches mint and up to treat vertical
where<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:41.469> come<00:01:41.679> and<00:01:41.829> finish<00:01:41.950> up<00:01:42.579> with<00:01:43.389> the

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
where we come and finish up with the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.440 
hands close to the close to the air and
it's<00:01:45.460> called<00:01:45.639> a<00:01:45.729> tee<00:01:45.880> finish<00:01:46.179> because<00:01:46.270> it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it's called a tee finish because it

but<00:03:31.420> that's<00:03:31.930> pretty<00:03:32.170> close<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.470> relatively

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
but that's pretty close to relatively

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.930 
but that's pretty close to relatively
straight<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.160> nobody's<00:03:33.459> ever<00:03:33.580> asked<00:03:33.820> me<00:03:33.880> to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
straight but nobody's ever asked me to

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.150 
straight but nobody's ever asked me to
teach<00:03:34.390> them<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.630> hit<00:03:34.750> 20<00:03:35.290> or<00:03:35.380> 30<00:03:35.560> yard<00:03:35.769> hook<00:03:35.920> SAR

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
teach them to hit 20 or 30 yard hook SAR

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.710 
teach them to hit 20 or 30 yard hook SAR
23rd<00:03:36.550> 30-yard<00:03:37.000> slicer<00:03:37.269> that's<00:03:37.540> what<00:03:37.630> we're

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
23rd 30-yard slicer that's what we're

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.960 
23rd 30-yard slicer that's what we're
all<00:03:37.750> trying<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.080> get<00:03:38.200> rid<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.519> the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
all trying to get rid of and so the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.670 
all trying to get rid of and so the
whole<00:03:40.120> key<00:03:40.330> of<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.750> on<00:03:40.959> on<00:03:41.140> on<00:03:41.290> square<00:03:41.560> and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
whole key of that is on on on square and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.530 
whole key of that is on on on square and
solid<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.340> my<00:03:42.489> point<00:03:42.730> here<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.360> that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
solid so my point here is is that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.509 
solid so my point here is is that
there's<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.050> lot<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.530> golf<00:03:44.860> instruction<00:03:45.280> out

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
there's a lot of golf instruction out

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.850 
there's a lot of golf instruction out
there<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.930> key<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.709> you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
there and and the key is is that you

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.090 
there and and the key is is that you
have<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.070> be<00:03:48.780> cognizant<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.200> what<00:03:50.920> they're

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100

have to be cognizant of of what they're
saying<00:03:51.430> think<00:03:51.970> about<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.360> think<00:03:52.750> about<00:03:52.900> you

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
saying think about it think about you

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.500 
saying think about it think about you
know<00:03:53.739> what<00:03:54.040> they're<00:03:54.190> saying<00:03:54.430> about<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.760> setup

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
the ultimate thing of a rotational play

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.300 
the ultimate thing of a rotational play
because<00:04:05.350> they're<00:04:05.560> they're<00:04:05.950> turning

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
because they're they're turning

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.370 
because they're they're turning
immediately<00:04:06.730> when<00:04:07.540> they<00:04:07.690> they<00:04:07.989> come<00:04:08.200> across

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
the target line it's excuse me they're

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.570 
the target line it's excuse me they're
turning<00:04:11.200> immediately<00:04:11.800> when<00:04:11.980> they<00:04:12.100> when<00:04:12.459> they

turning immediately when they when they

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.390 
turning immediately when they when they
start<00:04:13.090> their<00:04:13.269> forward<00:04:13.570> upswing<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
start their forward upswing and so

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.710 
start their forward upswing and so
where's<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.730> club<00:04:15.880> coming<00:04:16.180> it's<00:04:16.600> coming
