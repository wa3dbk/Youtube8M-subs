00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.270
 hitting the line 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.150
 another facet and how enough 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.530
 fictitious you can earn and at the same time 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:32.080
 improve on the psyche 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:34.390
 how to do it from one school very much 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.380
 appropriate again come back to your knocked out 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.790
 an assassin who had a dog which I 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.870
 cotton pads tell no 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.850
 practice workout mother first goes 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.739
 practicing air strikes i mean you 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.910
 do or on the military market higher 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:56.949
 that is, a maximum of three rounds for example 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.150
 two minutes to go and you do it 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.110
 today we are water 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.199
 principle for 8 percent water and correct 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.159
 managing your bodies practically with water 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.540
 in the right place and concentration that is 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:18.369
 leads to this result, Ukraine, where 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.350
 here and that is going to work in the water all 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.150
 same boxing 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.960
 they are not boxing without using them 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.990
 just picked up there begins end to 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.990
 cars and there is a choice 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.939
 again make several episodes 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.740
 straight 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.190
 perform the most simple uppercut not 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.030
 circle under eyebrow and simple strokes 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.290
 The following is already relevant 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.170
 again to neuropsychic skills and 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 stamina out when you do the same 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.210
 blows well you take a breath 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.210
 hold your breath and under water 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.710
 do the maximum and then the same 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.270
 on the exhale 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.270
 make a conclusion 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.550
 thereby simultaneously turn out 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.520
 stamina and nagging feeling 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.920
 strike because in 1 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.230
 make your hit trajectories the most 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.740
 short and efficient at the same time 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.110
 provides a certain resistance 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.590
 your movement what makes the muscles 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.950
 more efficiently faster meaning you 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.110
 trying to be not poor and again your 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.440
 the trajectory acquires the best 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.040
 the shortest trajectory since the most 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.390
 effective because your movement 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.380
 will be most ergonomic in this 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.760
 nature of water 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.150
 this is the practice of using a name 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.940
 again warrior dog ninja including 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.560
 also used even when it is very 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.990
 cold water this activity by 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.280
 few hours at work 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.650
 if in the end a person mastered so let's say 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.799
 hit water is such a thing 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.579
 let the dates fully govern the whole 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.720
 with its liquid 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:33.439
 holidays direct context 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.430
 the right punch and getting the result 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.319
 there is therefore if you are engaged 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.510
 martial arts even boxing even 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.209
 some traditional if too 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.049
 useful for both strike and 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.049
 formations it is the nervous system and 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.049
 endurance
