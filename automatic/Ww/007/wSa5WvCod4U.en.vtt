00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.330
 the most important thing of what happened in this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.640
 match tomorrow guatemala will be measured against 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.890
 the selection of panama in that duel by 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.320
 know who will be the first place in the 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.410
 group although if both classify both 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.060
 they would be in the world cup so 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 we hope tomorrow I have a good match 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 the national team here is the most 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.480
 important of what happened in the duel the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400
 finish and well the goalkeeper staying 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.280
 with the guatemala ball he was still trying 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.990
 in this the archer have to say that I 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.300
 we will help beyond the goals 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.769
 received with seven goals from 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.170
 guatemala who had a good 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.819
 participation in the game in this the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.949
 goalkeeper william ramírez here we 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.870
 we heard in one of the interviews of 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.699
 luis garcía in the lower part 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 He kept the sky in that moment 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.389
 the goal and here the unfortunate doubt 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 for the national team the toquecito 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:57.449
 looking for the center of jordan clear and you 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.120
 gives again a play where guatemala 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.829
 ends up damaged by the diversion of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.140
 chile eduardo de lyon and the ball in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.890
 network background at that time was put 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.440
 in advantage the team of canada 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.470
 of sanctioning the sixth fault would have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.510
 matthew bríos with the 2 to 0 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.880
 At that time, Guatemala lost the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.830
 match aguilar with 2 to 1 for the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 national team and later this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.210
 play and the best goal for me in what 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.070
 we saw in those 40 minutes of football is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.800
 between these two selections humberto 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 Escobar tied things 2 to 2 with that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.740
 golazo here we see one of the plays of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.050
 walter in week is number 9 of those that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
 they tried also in the national table 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.950
 but that finally for him he could not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.680
 get the score already in the final stretch 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.470
 of the first time álvaro game came with 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 3 to 2 and Guatemala seemed to be leaving 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.930
 losing at rest but he appeared 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.179
 again humberto escobar with 3 to 3 and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.670
 so the first period was analyzed 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.130
 first part with the tie 3 to 3 in a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.679
 very even match between the selection of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 guatemala and the Canadian team before 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.119
 of the end of that first period 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.310
 had a new aguilar option that did not 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.259
 he could specify we are going to the second part 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.940
 the second 20 minutes here the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.250
 goalkeeper staying with the ball 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.910
 when guatemala seemed to be put on 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.890
 advantage 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.130
 we see the goalkeeper in the selection of 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.250
 Canada and here the goal and the comeback 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.380
 for the Guatemalan national team he 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.160
 again in advantage to guatemala with 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.950
 humberto escobar the 4 by 3 for the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.470
 national team there the goal and the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.070
 satisfaction of the people later 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.560
 guatemala would find in this play the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.100
 option of the goal and the 5 to 3 with william 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.740
 ramirez 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.080
 the goalkeeper let's get out of his 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.970
 goal that tried to hurt but 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.860
 that ends up hurt because 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.050
 he leaves his frame alone and takes the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.120
 note by william ramírez on 5 by 3 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.340
 already guatemala began to handle the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.680
 party you have to say that physically the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.720
 Canada's selection fell and that's what 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.550
 took good advantage of Guatemala that has 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.350
 come preparing not one or two 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.470
 months but for years this selection and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.810
 even with players like erick acevedo 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.370
 that are kept from processes that 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.800
 they started in 2000 when guatemala 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.860
 participated for the first time in a cup 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.450
 of the world that would come pablo estrada with 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.420
 6 to 3 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.160
 in the team of canada again have the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.190
 annotation could not well william ramírez 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.040
 in that play and humberto escobar put the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.110
 definitive 7 to 3 final result of 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.599
 match victory for the national team 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.099
 national the start the play and the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.590
 culminates with the touch that goes to the bottom 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.349
 of the network in the annotation 7 by 3 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.470
 for the national team in this we see 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.780
 how the pass is given by eric 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.330
 He said he also tried in some 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.430
 opportunities to hurt the frame 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.349
 we have but that unfortunately for him 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.239
 and for our selection could not 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.340
 find the goal although the result 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.720
 because it talks about the level that is being 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.579
 managing on behalf of the selection 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.260
 national that tomorrow will face 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.959
