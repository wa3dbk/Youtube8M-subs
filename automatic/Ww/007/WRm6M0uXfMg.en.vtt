yes is really really cool i mean it's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.740 
yes is really really cool i mean it's
it's<00:02:20.520> kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.820> similar<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> England<00:02:21.510> anyway<00:02:21.600> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
it's kind of similar to England anyway I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.810 
it's kind of similar to England anyway I
think<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.500> fans<00:02:22.739> people<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.340> say<00:02:23.489> what<00:02:23.670> was

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820

think the fans people to say what was
the<00:02:24.780> difference<00:02:24.870> between<00:02:25.140> American<00:02:25.530> fans

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
link is friends I think because the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.670 
link is friends I think because the
music<00:02:26.970> scenes<00:02:27.360> are<00:02:27.510> signed<00:02:27.750> interlinked<00:02:28.530> for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
music scenes are signed interlinked for

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.560 
music scenes are signed interlinked for
the<00:02:28.769> fans<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.100> consumer<00:02:29.549> but<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.420> nice

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
the fans of consumer but it's just nice

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.199 
the fans of consumer but it's just nice
to<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> heat<00:02:31.170> every<00:02:31.440> day<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.970> there

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
to be in the heat every day is there

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.390
