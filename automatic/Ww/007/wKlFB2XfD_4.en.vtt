00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello that's welcome in this hen 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 is the recipe of the day is tequila 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
 sunrise for one person you need 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.620
 400 tequila titles 2 centilitres of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.379
 grenadine 15 centilitres of orange juice 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 and a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.619
 the principle of this cocktail is to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 reproduce a rising sun and yes 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.480
 sunrise in the green so for that we go 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 to have multiple colors and for the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.080
 color of the sun no we will take 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 the water ranges so we will appreciate the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.829
 once make laurence cut in half 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 I get his juice the idea is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.890
 to get about 15 cents per liter 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 orange juice 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.750
 so I take three orange balls 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 it only remains for us to mount our 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.539
 cocktail so I already put some of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 ice in the bottom the tesla the spoon of 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 lemon juice the orange juice and finally 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.559
 grenadine syrup a washer for 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.210
 the decoration the tequila sunrise and ready to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.439
 taste of course if it's for 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 children or people who do not drink 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.580
 of alcohol you can reproduce the same 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.720
 principle by not putting tequila and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.220
 do not forget that abuse 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.080
 alcohol is dangerous for your health and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.290
 so you have to consume it with 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.290
 moderation 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.500
 if you want another cocktail recipe 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.230

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.970

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.100
