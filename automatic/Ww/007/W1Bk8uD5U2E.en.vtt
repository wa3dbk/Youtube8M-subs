00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.709 
performed they found a hidden release so
to<00:00:32.940> say<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:34.010> there<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.340> tremendous

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
to say and there was a tremendous

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.650 
to say and there was a tremendous
identification<00:00:36.800> by<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> people<00:00:38.600> by<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
identification by the people by the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
identification by the people by the
youth<00:00:40.070> with<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> characters<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.850> was

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
youth with the characters that I was

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.260 
youth with the characters that I was
doing<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.969> because<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
doing and and because of this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
doing and and because of this
identification<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.200> think<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.590> became<00:00:46.829> very

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
identification I think they became very

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.950 
identification I think they became very
popular<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> other<00:00:48.600> side

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
popular and I think on the other side

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
popular and I think on the other side
