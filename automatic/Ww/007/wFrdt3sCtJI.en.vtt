try<00:02:35.920> for<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.250> first<00:02:36.280> time<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.819> suggest<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:38.109> try

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
try for the first time I suggest not try

00:02:38.470 --> 00:03:20.800 
try for the first time I suggest not try
a<00:02:38.500> big<00:02:38.829> area<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.609> or<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.850> big<00:02:40.120> pile

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.619 

now<00:03:21.810> gotta<00:03:22.440> pick<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.010> other<00:03:23.280> two<00:03:23.629> to

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
now gotta pick up the other two to

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.410 
now gotta pick up the other two to
accommodate<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.680> prinicpal<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.849> second

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
accommodate the prinicpal to the second

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.309 
accommodate the prinicpal to the second
and<00:03:27.660> maybe<00:03:27.989> even<00:03:28.260> adjust<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.890> first<00:03:29.790> town

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
and maybe even adjust the first town

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.380 
and maybe even adjust the first town
next<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.590> one

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
next to that one

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.470 
next to that one
these<00:03:33.390> are<00:03:33.599> all<00:03:33.720> little<00:03:33.989> bit<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.410> tricks<00:03:34.769> that

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
these are all little bit of tricks that

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:59.119 
these are all little bit of tricks that
hope<00:03:36.480> opposed<00:03:37.049> no<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.560> at<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.980> end

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
hope opposed no and at the end

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.440 
hope opposed no and at the end
everything<00:03:59.459> looks<00:03:59.790> great

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.100 
which creates weakness in the tile for
the<00:05:10.190> top<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.699> break<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.389> grout<00:05:11.599> to<00:05:11.840> start

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
the top and break and the grout to start

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:20.379 
the top and break and the grout to start
cracking<00:05:12.650> so<00:05:18.160> here<00:05:19.160> is<00:05:19.340> how<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.610> install

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
cracking so here is how to install

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:50.530 
cracking so here is how to install
kitchen<00:05:21.020> tile<00:05:21.320> porcelain<00:05:22.070> tile<00:05:22.639> 24<00:05:23.270> by<00:05:23.449> 24

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.900 

so<00:05:51.540> there<00:05:51.690> is<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:51.840> lot<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.260> playing<00:05:52.500> around<00:05:52.910> with

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
so there is a lot of playing around with

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.740 
so there is a lot of playing around with
the<00:05:54.090> installations<00:05:56.060> that's<00:05:57.060> how<00:05:57.420> you<00:05:57.480> can

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
the installations that's how you can

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
the installations that's how you can
actually<00:05:57.900> tell<00:05:59.300> we<00:06:00.300> have<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.630> great<00:06:01.200> installer

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
actually tell we have a great installer

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:09.440 
actually tell we have a great installer
compared<00:06:02.550> to<00:06:03.560> rough<00:06:05.990> pal<00:06:06.990> Center
