00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.220
 then 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.150
 we look for a corner of slamming badly there are basically two methods for

 to remain all of them mariatti cycles and to change face and orientation 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.560
 determines of angles for example 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 the form is this here

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.410
 and also pretty quick to do 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.820
 we have seen that we have changed will end the text you run away 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.900
 pregnancy and in any case no good so let's try to know 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.240

 common arengario of adro 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.280
 we see that therefore g2 interia is not good because it is there but I can't find it 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.110
 work orientation for 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.060
 the orientation of this body

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.890
 we know it is not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.400
 what I have to go here 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.670
 this how many with orientation from right because in the same office as always

 trying to fix dark 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.520
 manual search 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.120
 then yesterday he could also avoid filling bolete with this 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.240
 cuomo corner 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.640
 I've brought the public to tie the fotooo 2 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.940
 you really find heaven 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 have it how many times it's worth it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.340
 but then you have to and watch tv d

 u2 renewal 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.300
 because otherwise 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 the configuration on tv nn we modify 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.329
 the second method instead consists of the checks defined them 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.439
 but I love you precisely 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.429

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.940
 through the orientation of this DVD 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.399
 should go a certain for everyone 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.399
 have been cellists we see 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.029
 seen 1 1 7 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.599
 let's see how the sims 2 tricks 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.599
 I am an advantageous manager 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.509
 d friend proc. 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.509
 and 2 others what time are elements 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.499
 this new invitation should go 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.799
 if you cheer on 2 asking for the big nightmare almost 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.109

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.560
 that will follow the curry this way

 kavroomboom 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:20.099
 already. then wizzair - translate this time because it is more 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.029
 easy 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.299
 turkey - bodrum and yours 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.389
 where is it

 photograph records 1 June 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.489
 so let's discover them blue if we decide to slowly correct the orientation 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.389
 it is immediately correct I am forced to work world doctor him until he does 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.259
 it matters 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.460
 tomorrow it can be done 2008 after removing nothing continues 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.519
 because you have already done all the rumors of green combinations 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.299
 however we have seen that we have put 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.349
 email 1 that in the same direction as 9 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.139
 therefore this state seems to be correct the stronger brother of 2 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.239
 both felt 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.279
 we have accompanied this report 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.849
 here we must put it back 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.999
 but fortunately there are not that we were interested in therapy below then 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.069
 we can safely turn 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.069
 this face without changing any of the old 'we have bike tracks 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.590
 I recommend eating from four corners of the same face because in 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.910
 this way you can turn freely 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.520
 top hack as a problem 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 70 worry about the orientation of this link 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.550
 15 I'll start at you lower 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.460
 closing 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 it will be simpler because the possibilities of which way it goes into 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.610
 which place are much more limited 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.050
 because not only 4 24 comments 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.180
 and therefore will be able to use the switching of one of the angles in for 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.550
 orientation green permutation burgers 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.749
 oo facebook

 always correctly 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.630
 in fact, if we have already found it, it is the short 2 5

 be the 5th I tried with 100 of the 2 the 2 model 4 the remote control of the world 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.990
 we continue 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.669
 let's see'

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.009
 me 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.719
 why this 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.559
 then let's try 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:43.189
 we put it 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.189
 in the area where we want to take it 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300
 this place here fideleff these two 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.539
 those who benpensano 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.539
 what the want to try to bring this to 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.229
 stop 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.510
 these this is correct though these two 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.510
 I missed the peak of a point we live for 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.860
 1 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.150
 the tour 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.770
 now we see that orientation 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.680
 correct 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.389
 if this also goes to current, this is correct, however, we already have 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.319
 a problem 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.569

 open invoice for Saturday cooked when we have properly arranged we leave 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.520
 that 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.389
 if this piece that the orientation of the simple 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.229
 facebook fun from bumps 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.219
 study go, good 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.659
 - I also love the impossible this piece of water because there is already a new one

 Sep 2009 giant points of the wrong simply red configuration 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.089
 immediately my hand 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:55.719
 to change the decent orientation there are certain tricks that are 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.349
 can use 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.689
 war to find different configurations 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:05.610
 santa rita recchi corners never hollow all corners 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:09.639
 beautiful and also some examples 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.849
 if this did not have a continuous jump. 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:18.669
 we have examples that are oriented and with whom of you this is the thing 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.580
 main procurement above 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.449
 it to comment in this way and the adults as readable 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.909
 all that falls, however, that they hate 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.919
 now this moment the other center that can become the main face 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.909
 licenide would still remain varieties of correctly 

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:43.519
 and even these here palate so I only have two configurations with you 

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:46.449
 I am giving the middle layer all the angles remain at 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:47.479
 their place 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:50.330
 print with a decent mind that go in their place 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.710
 therefore it means that it is only areas with different configurations of centers. to 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.710
 change angles again 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.389
 and how much you earn a first way to try 2 

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:05.289
 together with you I'll show you how to do it 

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:08.399
 still presents modify
