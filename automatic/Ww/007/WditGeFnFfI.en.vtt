while as well and then the only place
you're<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.490> really<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:17.820> beat<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> over

you're going to really get beat is over
the<00:00:18.720> top<00:00:18.750> down<00:00:19.590> deep<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.550> you're<00:00:20.670> also<00:00:20.789> get<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the top down deep but you're also get a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.939 
the top down deep but you're also get a
lot<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> pressure<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.050> middle<00:00:22.199> around<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
lot of pressure up the middle around the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.400 
lot of pressure up the middle around the
sides<00:00:23.189> play<00:00:23.939> action<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.630> QB<00:00:25.019> contain

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
sides play action you can QB contain

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.490 
sides play action you can QB contain
this<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.890> guys<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.580> front<00:00:26.930> so<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.260> it's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
this for guys up front so I think it's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
this for guys up front so I think it's
got<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> lot<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> value<00:00:29.369> actually<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> short

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
got a lot of value actually on a short

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.810 
got a lot of value actually on a short
field<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.050> between<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> 20<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.340> 30<00:00:32.550> yard

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
field like between the 20 and 30 yard

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 
field like between the 20 and 30 yard
line<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.270> think<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.600> very<00:00:33.660> good<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.320> you'll

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
line I think it's very good but you'll

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
line I think it's very good but you'll
also<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.579> some<00:00:35.700> random<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> gaps<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> will

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
also get some random a gaps that will

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.000 
also get some random a gaps that will
lead<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.079> sorts<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.469> problem<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
lead to all sorts of problem for the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.150 
lead to all sorts of problem for the
quarterback<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> Hubie

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
quarterback so here we got a Hubie

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.389 
quarterback so here we got a Hubie
contain<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.260> guy<00:00:43.410> had<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> screen

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
contain on and this guy had a screen

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.830 
contain on and this guy had a screen
going<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.000> couldn't<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.420> off<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:45.660> tried

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going and couldn't get it off he tried

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
going and couldn't get it off he tried
to<00:00:45.930> run<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.110> again<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.610> get

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
to run it again and just could not get

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.119 
to run it again and just could not get
the<00:00:47.969> screen<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.600> fast<00:00:49.020> enough<00:00:49.200> partly

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the screen off and fast enough partly

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.260 
the screen off and fast enough partly
because<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.670> subbed<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.090> some

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
because we had subbed in some

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
because we had subbed in some
linebackers<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.050> front<00:00:52.379> which<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.190> do

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
linebackers up front which you can do

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.270 
linebackers up front which you can do
with<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> punt<00:00:54.210> return<00:00:54.480> zone<00:00:54.750> defense

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
with this punt return zone defense

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
with this punt return zone defense
behind<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.480> cornerbacks

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
behind them it's a lot of cornerbacks

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.349 
behind them it's a lot of cornerbacks
and<00:00:58.199> safeties<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> they'll<00:00:59.730> catch<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> lot<00:01:00.239> of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and safeties so they'll catch a lot of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
and safeties so they'll catch a lot of
the<00:01:00.420> balls<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:02.340> thrown

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the balls really that it that are thrown

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.830 
the balls really that it that are thrown
back<00:01:02.609> there<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> may<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.420> good<00:01:03.660> catch

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
back there is one I may have good catch

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
back there is one I may have good catch
skills<00:01:04.199> you'll<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.280> weird<00:01:05.549> egg<00:01:05.790> apps<00:01:06.060> like

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
skills you'll get weird egg apps like

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.910 
skills you'll get weird egg apps like
that<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> practice<00:01:07.530> mode<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> was

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that this was in practice mode it was

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120 
that this was in practice mode it was
like<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> stun<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.700> gap<00:01:09.260> really<00:01:10.260> fast<00:01:10.530> developing

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
like a stun a gap really fast developing

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.530 
like a stun a gap really fast developing
you<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> block<00:01:11.700> shed<00:01:12.000> once<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> while<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you get a block shed once in a while to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.050 
you get a block shed once in a while to
write<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> middle<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.820> kind

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
write up the middle so I think it's kind

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.899 
write up the middle so I think it's kind
of<00:01:15.119> cool<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.200> 12<00:01:16.619> yard<00:01:16.890> line<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.400> think

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
of cool here we are 12 yard line I think

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
of cool here we are 12 yard line I think
we<00:01:17.970> threw<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.299> QB<00:01:18.600> contain<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
we threw on the QB contain here so this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
we threw on the QB contain here so this
guy<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:20.790> didn't<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.090> anywhere<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> go

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
guy really didn't have anywhere to go

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.080 
guy really didn't have anywhere to go
he's<00:01:21.960> tried<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> run<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:24.000> all

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
he's tried to run but you know got all

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
he's tried to run but you know got all
jammed<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.810> think<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.220> some

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
jammed up I think I think this has some

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
jammed up I think I think this has some
some<00:01:26.729> actual<00:01:27.000> potential<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
some actual potential here now what I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.249 
some actual potential here now what I
will<00:01:28.770> say<00:01:28.950> about<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:31.140> you've

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
will say about it is that what you've

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
will say about it is that what you've
got<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> cover<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.189> invert<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:32.850> guy<00:01:33.600> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
got the cover to invert your guy your

that<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:38.040> through<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.400> practice<00:01:38.790> mode<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that I got through in practice mode that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
that I got through in practice mode that
guy<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> far<00:01:40.829> back<00:01:40.860> you've<00:01:41.640> got<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> patrol

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
guy in the far back you've got to patrol

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.670 
guy in the far back you've got to patrol
the<00:01:42.390> middle<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> field<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.500> have

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the middle of the field because you have

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
the middle of the field because you have
no<00:01:43.890> deep<00:01:44.159> blue<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> middle<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.570> two

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
no deep blue in the middle your two

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.230 
no deep blue in the middle your two
corners<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> far<00:01:46.560> outside<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:47.579> start<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
corners on the far outside will start to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
corners on the far outside will start to
pinch<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.840> towards<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> middle<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> farther

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
pinch in towards the middle the farther

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
pinch in towards the middle the farther
back<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> covered<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
back they go just like a covered to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
back they go just like a covered to
invert<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> deep

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
invert but you really don't have a deep

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.429 
invert but you really don't have a deep
blue<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.299> there<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.720> got<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
blue back there so that's got to be you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.920 
blue back there so that's got to be you
here<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.670> practice<00:01:56.820> mode<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> wasn't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
here I was in practice mode so I wasn't

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.289 
here I was in practice mode so I wasn't
controlling<00:01:58.259> him<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.759> trying<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> see

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
controlling him I was just trying to see

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.060 
controlling him I was just trying to see
what<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.930> pressures<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.530> could<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
what kind of pressures we could get and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859 
what kind of pressures we could get and
a<00:02:02.310> gaps<00:02:02.880> i<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.180> i<00:02:03.210> put<00:02:03.420> julius<00:02:03.719> peppers

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
a gaps i think i put julius peppers

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
a gaps i think i put julius peppers
right<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> middle<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.219> worked<00:02:05.430> real

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
right up the middle there it worked real

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.749 
right up the middle there it worked real
nice<00:02:06.649> but<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.950> mean<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.429> getting<00:02:08.610> some

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
nice but I mean we were getting some

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.490 
nice but I mean we were getting some
good<00:02:08.879> pressure<00:02:09.149> some<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.080> nice<00:02:10.200> pressure

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
good pressure some really nice pressure

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.470 
good pressure some really nice pressure
just<00:02:10.800> from<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.489> pun<00:02:11.670> returning<00:02:12.300> zone

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
just from the the pun returning zone

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.400 
just from the the pun returning zone
defense

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
defense

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.750 
defense
or<00:02:13.560> upon<00:02:13.800> return<00:02:14.070> man<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.640> was

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
or upon return man I think that was

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.190 
or upon return man I think that was
probably<00:02:14.850> turn<00:02:15.180> man<00:02:15.360> defense<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.020> tried

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
probably turn man defense we just tried

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.160 
probably turn man defense we just tried
once<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> while<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.630> overall<00:02:18.630> though<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
once in a while and overall though you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.630 
once in a while and overall though you
can't<00:02:19.440> run<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.740> as<00:02:19.860> your<00:02:20.010> base<00:02:20.190> defense

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
can't run it as your base defense

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.330 
can't run it as your base defense
because<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.480> doesn't<00:02:21.930> allow<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.130> kind

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
because it doesn't allow you to to kind

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.670 
because it doesn't allow you to to kind
of<00:02:23.430> change<00:02:23.670> up<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.970> play<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.840> can't<00:02:25.140> rezone

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
of change up to play you can't rezone

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.710 
of change up to play you can't rezone
anyone<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.310> can't<00:02:26.580> change<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.210> hot<00:02:27.480> route

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
anyone you can't change your hot route

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.980 
anyone you can't change your hot route
and<00:02:27.990> your<00:02:28.170> guys<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.650> defense<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:30.450> can<00:02:30.570> only<00:02:30.660> QB

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and your guys on defense you can only QB

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.990

their linebackers and then click up on
your<00:02:40.200> right<00:02:40.380> stick<00:02:40.680> it'll<00:02:41.010> zone<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.520> so

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240
