00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 Hello everyone and welcome back a new video 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.920
 complete this tutorial I make 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.199
 see how to enable the display 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.340
 of hidden files on these hicks 10.8 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.789
 first let's see what a file is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.470
 hidden and a file that exists on the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.810
 own computer but that is not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.560
 viewable by normal user files 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.160
 hidden 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.860
 always start with the dot so if 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.329
 you download a file that begins with 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.559
 point you do not have the possibility of 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.450
 view it or the folders of the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.149
 your mac starting with the point 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.250
 in fact they will not be displayed however 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.879
 there is a little trick to note 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 view these files first 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.930
 open the terminal that you can find 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.930
 in terminal utility applications 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 at this point we should write this 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.930
 this code the falls bright computer 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.009
 apple dot finder apple files through 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 so let's give command c also find it 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.159
 in description we paste and press now 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.369
 the postponement 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:34.530
 now we will have to run as a reboot of the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:40.079
 finder so to do that let's copy this 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 written kg the finder pastes and we give 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.680
 sending 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 now the rezzato file restart like 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.700
 let's see we find the hidden files and of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.829
 they store and localize are two files that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 are present on our mac since 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.829
 when we made the first start but 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.729
 which are hidden because of how 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.159
 you see they start with the point so if 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.439
 but now we want to hide the files 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.170
 hidden because anyway if apple has them 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.970
 hidden there will obviously be a reason 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.980
 he hid them because they are 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.349
 important 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.530
 so do not want your users to us 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.470
 you make particular changes therefore if 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.510
 we want maybe after seeing the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.099
 file we wanted to see return to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.659
 normal of result and if of it therefore 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.319
 hide them 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.580
 it will be enough to copy this inscription 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.560
 in the terminal 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.970
 but instead of through writing maybe 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.310
 written false send now restart the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.110
 finder always with the word kill il 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.660
 finder and how it is done in the past are from 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.879
 new disappeared this is a trick 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.209
 very useful but maybe if on the internet 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.190
 find some guide to implement it 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.220
 just look at working on files 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.810
 hidden and through this simple 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.720
 step possible to view in me 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.720
 for sykes montin lion the file between 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.370
 invisible quotation marks so I hope 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.230
 that this video was helpful to you 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.359
 I enjoyed myself as always vi 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.819
 remember to put I like writes either 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.290
 my dog, thanks for your attention to 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.440
 next video 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.440
 Hello
