what i thought about the game since so
many<00:00:38.219> people<00:00:38.489> asked<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.840> review<00:00:40.230> currently

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
many people asked my review currently

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
many people asked my review currently
standing<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> game<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.420> could<00:00:42.600> do

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
standing of the game if like I could do

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.000 
standing of the game if like I could do
like<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> point<00:00:43.140> system<00:00:43.350> would<00:00:43.649> probably<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
like a point system would probably I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
like a point system would probably I
probably<00:00:44.100> give<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.700> eight<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> ten<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
probably give it an eight out of ten and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420 
probably give it an eight out of ten and
here's<00:00:45.960> why<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:47.340> thought<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:49.250> thought<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
here's why I thought that I thought the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
here's why I thought that I thought the
destinies<00:00:50.969> PvE<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.770> cool<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
destinies PvE was really really cool it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
destinies PvE was really really cool it
was<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.879> innovative<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:55.170> people<00:00:55.410> are

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
was really innovative some people are

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
was really innovative some people are
comparing<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> borderlands<00:00:56.550> whatever

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
comparing it to borderlands whatever

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.349 
comparing it to borderlands whatever
halo<00:00:58.489> then<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.760> different<00:00:59.940> games<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
halo then all these different games I

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.930 
halo then all these different games I
thought<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:00.989> its<00:01:01.170> own<00:01:01.260> unique<00:01:01.500> game

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
thought of it as its own unique game

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.070 
thought of it as its own unique game
especially<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.480> got<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
especially when we got to see in the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
especially when we got to see in the
beta<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> PVE<00:01:05.990> how<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> looked<00:01:07.380> or<00:01:08.280> whatever

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
beta the PVE how it looked or whatever

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100 
beta the PVE how it looked or whatever
and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.119> towards<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> end<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> beta

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and then towards the end of the beta

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
and then towards the end of the beta
they<00:01:10.320> released<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.189> moon<00:01:11.460> mission<00:01:11.939> which

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
they released this moon mission which

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.090 
they released this moon mission which
was<00:01:12.810> phenomenal<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.560> probably<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
issue with it with the PvP and this is

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.160 
issue with it with the PvP and this is
what<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.460> me<00:02:26.640> held<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.090> helped<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> game<00:02:27.960> back

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

from<00:02:28.200> getting<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.830> really<00:02:28.980> good<00:02:29.100> rating<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.730> me

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
from getting a really good rating for me

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.450 
from getting a really good rating for me
personally<00:02:30.200> was<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.470> Bungie<00:02:31.860> decided<00:02:32.340> to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
personally was that Bungie decided to

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.600 
personally was that Bungie decided to
show<00:02:32.780> PvP<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:34.050> join<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.680> progress<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
show PvP with join in progress and and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.760 
show PvP with join in progress and and
really<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.180> understand<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.260> beta<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
really like I understand it's a beta and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.430 
really like I understand it's a beta and
you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.040> expect<00:02:41.430> great<00:02:41.959> complete<00:02:42.959> products

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
you can expect great complete products

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.090 
you can expect great complete products
from<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> beta<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:45.410> certainly<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.650> expect

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
from the beta but certainly I can expect

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.980 
from the beta but certainly I can expect
join<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.520> progress<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.209> not<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.570> part<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
join in progress to not be a part of a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.190 
join in progress to not be a part of a
game<00:02:49.170> anymore<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.510> reason<00:02:52.020> why

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
game anymore and that's the reason why

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.840 
game anymore and that's the reason why
that's<00:02:52.440> such<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> big<00:02:52.739> deal<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.610> if

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that's such a big deal is because if

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.310 
that's such a big deal is because if
joining<00:02:54.239> progress<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.780> allowed<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.110> stay<00:02:55.290> in

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
joining progress is allowed to stay in

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.740 
joining progress is allowed to stay in
the<00:02:55.440> final<00:02:55.830> product<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:57.390> basically

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the final product that basically

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.780 
the final product that basically
invalidates<00:02:58.470> any<00:02:58.650> sort<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.980> ranking<00:02:59.400> system

or anything like that unless Bungie

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.310 
or anything like that unless Bungie
decides<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.790> include<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.450> an<00:03:03.690> actual

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
surprised but unfortunately based off

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.980 
surprised but unfortunately based off
the<00:05:18.650> fact<00:05:18.830> that<00:05:18.919> they<00:05:19.449> included<00:05:20.449> a<00:05:20.570> system

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
the fact that they included a system
