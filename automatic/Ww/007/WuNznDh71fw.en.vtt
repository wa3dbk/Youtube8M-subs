00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.780
Hey there! 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.120
I'm now going to leave you with a little song

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.939
I'm recording for my next album...

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.210
the famous new album

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.680
I've been promising since three years now.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.080
and…

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.250
Well, just tell you that

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.570
it's name will be “Pa'fuera y pa'dentro”,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.930
and that I'm recording it with Fisura. 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.120
Fisura is an audiovisual cooperative network

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.920
which supports free culture 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.930
as I do myself. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.860
And…

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.380
And… well, 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.170
this song is about that other way of understanding love

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.710
that feminism teaches us

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.690
and its called “Contigo” (With you)

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.260
I won't die if you're not here

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.340
I'm fine walking without you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.540
I don't need you, you are not my soul mate

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.360
I'm learning to heal all my wounds by myself

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.080
But with you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.680
It's true the world seems a little less ugly

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.040
with you

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.400
it's true sometimes breaking the chains hurts a little less

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.720
and I learn with you and I walk with you

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.500
I love everything we've shared

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.020
throwing barriers away, breaking myths

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
I want you free

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.420
I want to be free with you myself

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.320
They say that freedom is scary

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.519
I'm more afraid of never feeling it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.900
no one said it would be easy

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.760
to get free from prince charming tales

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.560
The moon tells me I can be a witch
be ugly and violent and murder a king

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.439
Break expectations, 
crack the system

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:38.439
get a broom and instead of sweeping,
leap on and fly away at night

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.639
No fear of walking through an alley

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.799
no fear of doing what I feel like

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.480
with you

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.220
it's true the world seems a little less ugly

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.740
with you

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:58.100
it's true sometimes breaking the chains hurts a little less

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.499
and I learn with you and I walk with you

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.319
I love everything we've shared

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.900
throwing barriers away, breaking myths

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.489
I want you free

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.500
I want to be free with you myself

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.880
I want you free and I want to be free with you myself

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.220
