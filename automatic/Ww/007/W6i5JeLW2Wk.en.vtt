so now we have the front end of the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.699 
so now we have the front end of the
machine<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.050> air<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.290> where<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:33.560> can

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
machine up in the air to where we can

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.979 
machine up in the air to where we can
service<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.310> bottom<00:02:34.640> side<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> few

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
service the bottom side of it so a few

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.720 
service the bottom side of it so a few
things<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.410> we<00:02:36.530> might<00:02:36.739> want<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> do<00:02:37.220> number
