00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.605
My name's Purnima. I'm from Bangalore

00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.641
Today I'm going to make Badam Puri

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:17.746
We take maida in a bowl

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:31.294
Ghee

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.802
Milk

00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:44.661
The dough's ready. We rest it for 5 minutes

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.790
We heat water for the sugar syrup

00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:54.098
Add the sugar

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
And cook for 5 minutes

00:00:57.904 --> 00:00:59.904
The sugar syprup's ready

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.129
We add the cardamom

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:11.103
We now make the puris

00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:24.787
We fold it into triangles

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
We stick a clove in the centre, so that the puri doesn't open up

00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:38.122
We heat oil and fry the puris

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.110
We fry them till golden brown 

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:56.040
And add them to the sugar syrup

00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:06.900
We now remove the puri from the sugar syrup

00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:14.650
And garnish with grated coconut
