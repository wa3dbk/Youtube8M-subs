00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 with a steaming motor bought a motor on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.050
 dismantling he smokes he specifically smokes what 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 This you not tried tried 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.080
 Whit better rinse or expensive 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.859
 the one that I showed you tried 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 not pour into the motor and the candles because 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 I have oil in the course of working out 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.520
 which once worked out in which 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 once this thing was added 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 Now salitto I tried to puddle 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:52.050
 pour in each of the candles now let's go 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 further Metov is that needs expensive 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.789
 cheaper 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:02.699
 there is this acetone i heard somewhere that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.140
 need to mix acetone with dibala two pins 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.000
 points in Lithuanian 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.680
 want a friend with another such thing you need 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.750
 interfere 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 like he helps closely if one herself 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.100
 situation with salt and ice stand up what 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.100
 then try 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 Well, ska, let it be worth it to close and 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 actually poison solvent stop 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 just dissolving 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.020
 now what bad is acetone can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:04.679
 get into the oil and dilute it once 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.470
 dissolve itself but we watch nothing 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:17.150
 then I poured a little just nothing much 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.620
 gram wait and see short 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.980
