00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.879
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.410
 so I am little and welcome to the next 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.880
 episode of the weapons guide today 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.740
 let's talk about the preferred the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.990
 expected that we all love the gun 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.550
 laser if a lot of people compare it with the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.130
 nasal sample and for me this gives a thousand 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.660
 turns pistol laser beichuan pistol 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.599
 of rays as you know and I 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.910
 I call the water and good 20 bullets 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.140
 160 sober main charger 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.089
 secondary now let's talk about that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.519
 green is the only weapon that does not shoot at 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.379
 grenades or shoot balls there what 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.000
 we have two capsules we are going to 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.129
 put it in slow motion very slowly in 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.799
 image we see the nuclear symbol and then 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.510
 in the recharge meter the same thing that puts 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.610
 atomic or really is a weapon 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.500
 created to fight with the zombies not 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.909
 let's be realistic a weapon created 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.799
 simply for the zombies then 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.180
 logically it will probably be the best 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.879
 game weapon does not suit the likes of 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.619
 good colors we need to upload 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.119
 of rounds with this double shot weapon 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.159
 bound to increase the damage with them 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.720
 in round 25 with only 67 shots 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.159
 you also have to know how to use it because 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.540
 many people waste lots of ammunition 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.729
 and that's why after I'll upload a guide 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.009
 how to use it well after my 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.960
 years of giving him cane and what happens when 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.640
 we improve it many wrong people do not 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.060
 Increased damage is the only weapon that 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 best 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 does not increase the damage and this I say 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 totally sincere and knowing what 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.479
 I say the only thing that makes us is 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.600
 multiply the charger by 2 that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.939
 flame ray weapon for two sports we 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.860
 increase the charger by 2 gives us 200 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.110
 secondary loader bullets which we 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.060
 greatly increases the probability or 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.500
 possibility of climbing rounds so nothing 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.970
 if you need a weapon to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.689
 go up rounds either be it main or 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.810
 high school 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.939
 sorry this is our weapon is worth so 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.530
 here ends today's summary really 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.880
 I do not have to say anything about it improved 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.130
 since it is the same as without improvements 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.929
 but with more bullets and nothing more a kiss 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.880
 for everyone to be happy we see each other in 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.420
 next videos and until next time 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.420
 bye
