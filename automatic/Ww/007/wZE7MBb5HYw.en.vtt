00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.220
 hi personal bank you are with me 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.580
 Great, thank you. 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.129
 I'll start the video by letting the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.699
 people who have scalp very 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.590
 sensitivity that easily irritates 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.960
 Unfortunately I will not be able to do this. 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.300
 recipe so good because it might be that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.939
 redness occurs 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.029
 scalp that despite being natural 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.110
 What we are going to use today is strong. 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.480
 so if you have too much scalp 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.450
 sensitive you'd better not use 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.450
 I bet everyone has this 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.239
 ingredient at home but usually you 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.149
 uses to do something else not to 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.660
 to set your hair and one day being 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.149
 here in my house and one day I solved 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.230
 leave my hair to see what 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.379
 happened 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.449
 The time I played in my hair knows 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.150
 it seems that the scarce had already 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.970
 forming knows nothing without having passed the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.100
 finishing cream or anything just in time 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.140
 that I went in my hair looks like the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 cases are already creating form I found 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:24.590
 amazing and when it gets dry that way 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:34.070
 here the ingredient that today is cinnamon 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:36.290
 I know a lot of bad girls but it's not 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.770
 that the goal of today's video is 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.240
 It is not lightening the hair is to set your 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.890
 curls the way I used hair that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.290
 it worked out 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.010
 the result then I sincerely hope 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.100
 that your hair responds just like mine 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.560
 hair responded to this treatment a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.240
 something you have to talk about before you speak 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.240
 on this revenue is as follows 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.630
 Your hair for Grandma does the amount you 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.819
 I'm teaching the amount of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.099
 Cinnamon I am talking about because if 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.500
 You overreact believe me until I 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.780
 I got enough of that amount 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.900
 experience of me talking to you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.060
 so use the right measure 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.450
 because if you are generating the quantity 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.430
 what will happen is the effect of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.920
 completely opposite 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.750
 the proposal of this video instead of 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.660
 to define the curls that the hair is to stay 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.690
 It's good to stay dry, it's not cool, it's fine. 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.330
 So does it's the way I am. 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.830
 teaching here for you not to have 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.709
 no problem 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.760
 How are you going to make the recipe? 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.030
 I took a liter of water and then 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.989
 pan to make after boiling the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.269
 That one liter of water I added 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.549
 half a spoonful of cinnamon 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.790
 if you have hair the size of my 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.709
 you use half a teaspoon is're good 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.829
 half wrong in that half 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.920
 If you have the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.480
 hair the same length as I have 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.260
 a minor 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.540
 if you want to use less it will still be 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.160
 better the result on your hair and a 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.930
 thing also if your hair is 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.480
 very dry 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.970
 you better not do this treatment 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.829
 because it may be that your hair is 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.200
 more dry yet my hair does not 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.420
 I dry up with this but I've already seen 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.389
 many testimonials from girls talking 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.620
 cinnamon from dry hair and 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.889
 it never happened 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.769
 but if you have dry hair already 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.780
 as a precaution you better not do 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.269
 when the water begins to boil 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.690
 Then I'll add the pen so 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.260
 quick for the steam 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.299
 do not take the properties of this tea 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.319
 let it boil for more or less 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:05.230
 23 minutes and then you take it off 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.470
 Fire and let it cool, you're going to use it. 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.200
 this cold tea preferably its acting 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.100
 when the cold rehearsals' you will 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.180
 need to change 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:20.090
 Why are we going to do what we can? 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.720
 not to pass the cinnamon powder on the hair 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.390
 because if you could your hair 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.130
 leather hair will be scratching the 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.820
 very cool experience, believe me 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.280
 Because I already did it's fine, so you go. 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.010
 change container to be careful 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.270
 so it stays there in the background 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.970
 pan 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:46.640
 You're not going to use the little poop that goes 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:58.810
 stay in the back even and then there goes 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:05:05.090
 stay that way because it gets stronger 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.360
 good then wash your hair as you wash 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.390
 usually or after a hydration 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.370
 whatsoever to wash the 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.040
 hair when you have to leave 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.490
 Bath you're going to get your cinnamon tea. 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.470
 and will play in your hair and after that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.050
 I went back to playing in your hair, you did not 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.610
 You need to take my experience with this 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.220
 Tea is wonderful. 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:36.800
 When I play tea, it seems that the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:43.550
 curls are already creating shapes of nothing 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:45.890
 what happens at the time the sensation of touch 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.910
 is that the hair is dry 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:53.000
 before putting on my hair 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:06:00.020
 the comb slides into the hair and after that 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:03.650
 I put it on but I do not know 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.340
 worry because it's really okay 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.520
 and then after pulling without having to take 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.320
 your hair will end yours 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.500
 hair is usually good if you 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.770
 locke technical failure make sure you go 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.200
 ironing your combing cream passes and 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.910
 You go there and do your blog, do it. 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.600
 You do not have to take it out of your hair and 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.970
 dry that feeling that your hair is 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.190
 A little message he already knows is good and 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.010
 hair does not dry out is just a 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.590
 feel even that feeling of 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.750
 hair and full consumption is not 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.950
 will leave the hair dry 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.080
 need to worry 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.170
 if you do the way I'm talking 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.300
 people please do not exaggerate in 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.610
 amount of cinnamon that will not give 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.640
 A promise from the little finger that it will not 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.650
 spin because if you exaggerate it will stay 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.730
 resected and then there's no use fighting 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.820
 with me 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.280
 if you do not have cinnamon powder in your 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.030
 home if you only have those pieces of 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.580
 cinnamon 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.230
 you calculate there a half of a spoon 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.570
 I do not know how to talk to you about the amount 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.250
 because I am the sinpol even a thing 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.530
 What I need to explain is that this 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.970
 treatment with cinnamon has a 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:20.280
 he will not be accumulating the 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.770
 defects and it is not that you will make a 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.110
 once and never again need to do it again 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.230
 that you want or defects than cinnamon 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.560
 It gives you time to define the curls you 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:35.610
 always have to make the curls last a 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.220
 This one is my second dft and I 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.460
 I did not have to spend any living 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.260
 usually nothing happens in the first df 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.410
 in the second, you already have to give some 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:51.600
 But I still did not feel the need. 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:55.020
 to use anything defined yet and I hope 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:58.230
 stay a long time because you are 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:02.010
 cold to vote none to wash the hair 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:04.440
 so I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:07.110
 You liked it, do not forget to stay here. 

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.720

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.380
 to sign up for my channel a kiss

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.380
