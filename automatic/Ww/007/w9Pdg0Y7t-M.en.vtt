00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
should have made the hoop a little bit

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
should have made the hoop a little bit
bigger<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.829> ok<00:01:47.100> it'll<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.700> pretty

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
bigger but that's ok it'll do so pretty

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.740 
bigger but that's ok it'll do so pretty
much<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> same<00:01:49.020> concept<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:51.299> TNT
