00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.070
 have done well source, it is all very promising 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.699
 they are very worried about it 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.229
 big round in the netherlands will only the second time worked out well 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.470
 the water 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.939
 just like recently with a few cents but then you also have what you eat and 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:28.579
 does not apply 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.480
 and then you go 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.490
 the market after how shopping plus bus 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.490
 people look of course yes it is easier 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 kurt russell european stock exchanges 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.200
 well it is a facelift that is an increase in the number 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.400
 victims that he 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.990
 seat this fits very well with you 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.770
 because it is impossible to split one of the pairs with booklets 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.790
 and that rotten qua 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.659
 yes there is also more sports 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.659
 you 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.970
 when the market becomes a real one again 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.670
 and give a real modern party lift 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.860
 MDM actually wins though derby can market especially the weather 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.950
 return 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460
 the sign that the two things are going to do 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.690
 but we go to 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.570
 but the market is spicy redecorating and the second what we are going to do 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.100
 to do 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.320
 And that has more to do with the entrepreneurs is that the company has too much more 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 want to give space 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.100
 6 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.800
 is the new regulation 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.590
 very cool 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.620
 how should i say 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.420
 you know where you can easily you are welcome you can go through whatever you like 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.470
 can expect if you have certain reimbursement 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.200
 I really want to be on stage again 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.820
 yes it was a bit of the same 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.380
 and then you can go to the presentation of the World Cup final of months away 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.170
 realistic regulations because, as everyone knows, the waste will last twenty years 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 about everything 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.810
 And that's a good thing is that always the first five to kick in the kick 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.260
 the ground was that the first road would go, so they were announced today 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.859
 it started the ioc 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.979
 who behind the old on good grades must disappear the prohibition that he really 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.979
 beautiful looking 4 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.600
 I know that of course very hard work and regulations 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.260
 if you do not have any children yet and are looking into whether something has been built up in it 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.400
 to go that you never really really nice it also goes up 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.959
 I buy myself now I can open according to o'leary 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.499
 I think that child into the world 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.499
 the city of tomorrow to become the knowledge and in firm 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.669
 we are no better than it was just for invited guests and I have me 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:03.949
 then 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.429
 cards the nfl cup is a whole week later first received 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.839
 they have to go through the sour apple for the first time 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.159
 of course it must always be a mess before it 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.279
 a little worry 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.659
 if we've been watching for fourteen years and I hope so 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.729
 actually that there is much faster 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.889
 maybe two or two years from two years from now 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.169
 yes but you just come back on the market here 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.649
 then you again have a multitude of great opportunities 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.449
 but at least it's a place to look when you think about what you think 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.279
 that's how it is in this time 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.529
 It looks good 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:37.899
 the beauty 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:39.159
 It is clear 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.479
 it is safe and it is really a pleasure to come true aftertaste 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.469
 because that is what we want 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.289
 not just a market for the neighborhood 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.419
 but Marc van Heel the Hague is even stronger 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.419
 for the whole of the Netherlands 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.610
 OK 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.460
