we<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.690> our<00:01:03.809> navicular<00:01:04.410> band<00:01:04.710> navicular

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we have our navicular band navicular

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
we have our navicular band navicular
band<00:01:05.850> wraps<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> foot<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> navicular

band wraps the foot in the navicular

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
band wraps the foot in the navicular
bone<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.950> locks<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> foot<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:09.180> onto<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
bone and locks the foot down onto the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.109 
bone and locks the foot down onto the
mid<00:01:10.080> sole<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> shoe<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> offers<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> very

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
mid sole of the shoe so it offers a very

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.410 
mid sole of the shoe so it offers a very
secure<00:01:12.600> feeling<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.290> uneven<00:01:13.920> surfaces<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
secure feeling on uneven surfaces the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
secure feeling on uneven surfaces the
rest<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> upper<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.500> hydrophobic<00:01:17.130> foams

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
rest of the upper is hydrophobic foams

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
rest of the upper is hydrophobic foams
so<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> water<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so that water will go in and out and it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.679 
so that water will go in and out and it
won't<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.400> absorbed<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> shoe<00:01:21.270> won't<00:01:21.479> get

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
won't be absorbed in the shoe won't get

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.230 
won't be absorbed in the shoe won't get
heavier<00:01:22.020> wet<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.310> outsole<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
heavier wet on the outsole we have a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.539 
heavier wet on the outsole we have a
one-piece<00:01:24.780> design<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.530> no<00:01:25.710> rocks<00:01:26.009> will<00:01:26.310> poke

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
one-piece design so no rocks will poke

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
one-piece design so no rocks will poke
through<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> injure<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> runners<00:01:27.750> foot<00:01:28.049> we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
through and injure the runners foot we

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.620 
through and injure the runners foot we
have<00:01:28.650> excellent<00:01:29.159> traction<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> lug

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
have excellent traction with this lug

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
have excellent traction with this lug
material<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.369> concave<00:01:33.119> shape

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
material and it's also a concave shape

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
material and it's also a concave shape
so<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.380> runner<00:01:34.619> puts<00:01:35.100> their<00:01:35.280> weight<00:01:35.460> down

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so as the runner puts their weight down

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520 
so as the runner puts their weight down
the<00:01:35.939> shoe<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.750> spread<00:01:37.140> out<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the shoe will actually spread out and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
the shoe will actually spread out and
add<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.890> surface<00:01:38.340> area<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> shoe<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
add more surface area to the shoe the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
add more surface area to the shoe the
heel<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> shoe<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.770> beveled<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.369> rounded

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
heel of the shoe is beveled or rounded

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
heel of the shoe is beveled or rounded
like<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> natural<00:01:42.869> shape<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> runner's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740

like the natural shape of a runner's
foot<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.579> allow<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.790> runner<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.360> move

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
foot this will allow the runner to move

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.810 
foot this will allow the runner to move
forward<00:01:45.810> three<00:01:46.290> centimeters<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.189> heel<00:01:47.460> strike
