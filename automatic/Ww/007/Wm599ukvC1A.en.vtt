00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.850
 and I really believe that when there 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.700
 reception of part of the campus to the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 given the coaching staff is made 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:25.660
 everything is very simple we are a 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.439
 family with the theme of travel drinks league 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.070
 we really are more time between 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.020
 sharing the campus and the body 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.210
 technical that each one to the best with his 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.370
 family then that cordiality there 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.940
 at work 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.720
 It is transmitted on the playing field 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.970
 knowing that there 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.300
 a very important reception of part 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.240
 of the campus of which we are 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.610
 very proud very satisfied and 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.490
 is really giving us the result 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.670
 expected I think all three 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.089
 matches were different 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.390
 and although a common condition was the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.530
 comeback but I think the start was 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.930
 different us this party 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.840
 we had the first very clear option of 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 goal of the game after we had 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.320
 deconcentrations we were losing 2020 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.290
 but then we had very 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.550
 important to discount in the 1-0 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.399
 to tie 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.020
 shots on the clubs and situations 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.220
 a lot of risk 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.330
 was really modify what was 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.350
 modified 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.930
 and so have the character to turn 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.780
 the result is difficult but I return to 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.130
 insist 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.710
 the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.880
 you gain the sacrifice and effort that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.939
 they put the players was exciting and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.759
 I think you could have increased the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.179
 number of difference in the score 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.619
 necessary is none with any 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.179
 type of injury I think the performance and 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.120
 is minimizing the players and 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.360
 they were generally all had 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.459
 a very high performance and that's why as 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.459
 team we became very strong
