00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
is 2014 and so much identical I think to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.910 
is 2014 and so much identical I think to
the<00:00:16.770> old<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.199> connect<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.680> them

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the old one and it can connect to them

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070
