00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.790
 treviso bag - we are here with a desktop city that belongs to the range 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.380
 logitech the report that it is testo s520 equipped with mouse keyboard or mouse with 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.029
 NASA tracking 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.039
 keyboard with keys 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.960
 multimedia as you see we have the zoom button 100% human hertz more than one 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.380
 same menu applies to volume volume + volume - 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.180
 mute button play button pause forward backwards in the track as you see the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 dirt resistance is more than good 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.760
 after a month of poor use there are still no obvious signs we say 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.420
 accumulation of dirt on the keyboard and email on the Red Sea 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.530
 as you can see even after cleaning 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.940
 therefore keeping the dark with you t good in short, the teeth 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.810
 regarding the term paper. even at times when not installed on the deck 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.850
 I advise you to install it because it weighs very little, especially for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 go then use the keys in the second function that you find in the upper part 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.780
 that niggers. common the fancam plus f1 button is cool what you need 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.580
 menu keys that program them however in the basic functions then functionality 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.590
 typing 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.540
 arrows rather than sector of the numeric keypad works of course 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 even without installing anything, just connect the censor 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.180
 that life in practice the ability to receive 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.310
 draw a pig 7 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.270
 sensor mind that then also publishes the indicator for example of num lock 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.770
 rather than fuck 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.290
 as you see 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.180
 when I lock the key lock to understand us 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.360
 it's true 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.030
 the bed and the relative, however, remains illuminated therefore and easy to see 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 if you use for example for advice 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.870
 basic keys as I said that work even if so many have installed sepoint 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.470
 serious winners. understand how to install it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.990
 i how to configure it we have already created a video for this purpose 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
 I suggest going to see it on PC while our channel 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.629
 can be very useful 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 play button for example 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:31.879
 we have installed have gone all these two doors installed not connected 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.569
 we installed if we then simply connected this time 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.689
 Portuguese to remember who you 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.989
 it is guaranteed by the same logitech in the operation with windows xp vista 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.269
 rather than leaving latitude xt2 add a windos l would not like it 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.529
 so surely this that suits you for all the computers that have been 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.719
 sold say in the finalization 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.939
 I also gave them to those who will come in the future 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 as I said the function keys even without having installed if you then go well 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.189
 on tito distinguish them we have deliberately not installed 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.489
 just to see if this kit 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.340
 keyboard works in its basic functions even in this version it works 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.419
 have been amazed personally 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:19.579
 nimbus I stayed. affected by this compatibility however ie 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.579
 it is also present for the volume key ie 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.610
 I remember that 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.640
 let's talk about an easy computer is a tablet pc 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.769
 I remember then that the application we used to run this 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.259
 ditty 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:53.069
 and then pulici. easily preferable for anyone 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.529
 we didn't do any more 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.099
 in order to understand each other 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.609
 kit rt now we're going to see how I write but I take a notepad e 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.499
 demonstrate a little in practice how typing works 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.499
 those still silent 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.269
 therefore also excellent for those who can't stand and noisy oaks 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:21.639
 here we are 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.240
 as you can see we have practically written what we tried a little while ago 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.610
 connecting letters obviously we have written something that does not have a 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.610
 particular meaning 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.849
 as you can see the typing test, even as you feel it is more pleasant 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.800
 there are no loud noises. begin 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.239
 as for later it seemed right to show how the mouse works. 

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:02.389
 happy 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.220
 as you can see the tracing is absolutely fluid there are no delays 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.139
 therefore also the mouse that I promoted remember that the tt in 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.589
 question is a guitar and easy to use 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.590
 they have no main purpose 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.060
 if not to better serve your own notes that final 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.879
 the videorecensione ends here there is not otherwise altromercato to demonstrate 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.770
 We therefore recommend buying this kit for all people who do not 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.469
 the use of the computer or the example of accounting rather than in the 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:38.309
 knock down 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:43.460
 m handwritten. Simple internet browsing protection make it a day 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.039
 essential 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.280
 the fact of being equal to the spoils 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.530
 allows not to tire the posture 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.249
 both in writing and milan and addressing the mouse on an object il 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.650
 your interest 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.990
 a very convenient applause you can practically keep on your knees 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.029
 this kit 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.919
 however, you can easily continue your navigation 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.979
 rather than your online check in rather than your reading 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.529
 put 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:17.119
 good erotic see you soon with new videorecensione I recommend there 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.180
 let's see online 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.020
 a greeting sign up for the channel 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.449
 this is the important photo thing 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.379
 see you soon from 7 to serious
