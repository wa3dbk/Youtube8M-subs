00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.820
 That's how it sounds in the Thuringian Forest 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.130
 more precisely in zella-flour the small family business of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.649
 Arno Barthelmes the only manufacturer of tuning fork in Germany 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.730
 his great-grandfather has already made tuning forks here 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 voted 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.899
 Stein instrument makers and medical professionals set the tone worldwide 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.920
 but next to the tuning fork, the heart of the Thuringian still beats for a whole 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.180
 other passion 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.000
 Heavy rain also to give great honor and change was also the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.910
 base 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.740
 from the brought on January invention 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.730
 Munich ddp but what have a tuning fork to do with biathlon? 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 and what could none but probably have invented 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.270
 to solve the mystery 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.500
 accompanying him to his well-known Arndt Krause Inspiration Center info 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.610
 job 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.549
 whether it is storming or snowing outside 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.049
 Here the competitive athletes can use treadmills all year round 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:09.870
 work out 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.420
 Of course, the pros do not put off 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.340
 but on such skirollers 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.010
 and because it is well known that snow will be rarer in our latitudes 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.340
 Role else to use even more often at championships 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.440
 but the sports equipment often warns Krause and his charges 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.360
 issues 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.750
 In the extreme conditions, tires break off again and again 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.910
 and if a scooter at speeds of up to 60 km / h 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 breaks it can be really dangerous 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.110
 and when they help their son to crash the sometimes heavy ones too 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.130
 deliver it to Joel device it is of course not nice 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.220
 "These scooters would have to be able to improve, he thought 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.980
 Voices gave experts with biathlon passion 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.530
 from a first sketch Arno Barthelmes developed a sophisticated light 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.220
 metal structures 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.450
 in the machine in which otherwise the tuning fork are milled 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.940
 At the heart of his rollerblade Stay is the described 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.049
 two of them are screwed in the red ones 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.919
 now only two roles are missing 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.549
 two fenders as splash guard and the binding for the ski boots 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.139
 finished 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.859
 and what is different about this roller ski now compared to the conventional wheels 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.859
 so swinging around in ski rollers percent new technology because so called 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.049
 Technique used 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.209
 it is from the front to mitigate also a continuous complaining the pressure 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.619
 moderately distributed on the new tracks so one also wants to play 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.419
 This creates a driving experience as if you were skiing 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.209
 the continuous rails provide special stability 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.729
 Wheels attached directly to these bake at high loads 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:10.379
 ever tire the danger with the detaching tires is banned 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.340
 by so-called probably Canisius 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.840
 The rubber was chemically inseparably connected with the alloy wheels always here 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 looks impressive 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.869
 as far as the theory 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.579
 But now it has to be shown if the new scooters meet the strict requirements of 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 Professionals at all 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:35.300
 the feeling 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.849
 when you drop that role the crustaceans 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.069
 and above all the stability of it and I think you feel safe 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.449
 the dollar 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.900
 and even the biathlon celebrities were thrilled 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.200
 two pieces of jewelery signed by the owner 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.660
 Sven Fischer and Ricco were so excited that he loved his two 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.529
 Have autographed and still have a place of honor their experience 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.039
 But this is not the end for other parties 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.659
 he is constantly working on further developments of these prototypes 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.949
 For example, they are the only roller scooters for children with upstream 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.949
 stabilizer 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.189
 Of course you do not have to be a top athlete for the roller skater who likes 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.460
 Cross-country skiing does not make it snow all winter like this year 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.240
 want 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.240
 at least a good alternative now 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:30.999
 the snow
