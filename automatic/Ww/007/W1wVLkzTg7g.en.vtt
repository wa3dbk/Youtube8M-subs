that was actually released in germany
which<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.850> found<00:03:10.030> really<00:03:10.180> weird<00:03:10.660> because<00:03:10.870> i

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
which I found really weird because i

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.970 
which I found really weird because i
found<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:13.600> game<00:03:13.870> like<00:03:14.140> years<00:03:14.350> war<00:03:14.560> three<00:03:14.800> is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
found this game like years war three is

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.949 
found this game like years war three is
way<00:03:15.310> more<00:03:15.519> brutal<00:03:16.000> than<00:03:16.030> one<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.600> two<00:03:16.720> put

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
way more brutal than one and two put

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.900 
way more brutal than one and two put
together<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.709> it's<00:03:17.980> kind<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.220> weird<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.519> this

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
together so it's kind of weird that this

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.000 
together so it's kind of weird that this
is<00:03:19.090> what's<00:03:19.600> release<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.170> Germany<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:20.739> the

this was the first time I got it too and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.440 
this was the first time I got it too and

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.970 
I didn't quite know what to do with it
I<00:04:16.510> knew<00:04:16.900> there<00:04:17.080> was<00:04:17.170> a<00:04:17.200> guy<00:04:17.380> behind<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.830> wall

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
I knew there was a guy behind that wall

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.390 
I knew there was a guy behind that wall
so<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.220> just<00:04:18.400> shot<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.640> man<00:04:18.880> boom<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.130> ain't

so I just shot a man boom and that ain't
grenade<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:22.030> kind<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.870> awkward<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.850> yeah<00:04:24.850> I

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150
