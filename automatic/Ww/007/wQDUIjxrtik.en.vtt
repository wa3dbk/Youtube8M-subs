the the galaxy note here then followed
by<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.150> HTC<00:02:39.110> One<00:02:39.380> X<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.970> Galaxy

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
by the HTC One X and then the Galaxy

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.280 
by the HTC One X and then the Galaxy
Nexus<00:02:42.100> let<00:02:43.100> me<00:02:43.220> actually<00:02:43.430> zoom<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.150> some<00:02:44.510> us<00:02:44.720> on

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
couple things here so see the resolution

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
couple things here so see the resolution
here<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:49.910> I'm<00:02:49.970> going<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.209> I'm<00:02:51.140> going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.440> zoom

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
in in this chimney here let's look at

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.800 
in in this chimney here let's look at
the<00:02:56.630> detail<00:02:57.019> here<00:02:57.400> until<00:02:58.400> here<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.940> also<00:02:59.239> on

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
the detail here until here and also on

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.280 
the detail here until here and also on
my<00:03:00.079> galaxy<00:03:00.950> nexus<00:03:01.329> so<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.450> Galaxy<00:03:02.870> Nexus<00:03:02.989> you

my galaxy nexus so the Galaxy Nexus you
can<00:03:03.440> clearly<00:03:03.709> see<00:03:04.070> it's<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.370> little<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:05.440> great

let's go to this red car over here this

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.460 
let's go to this red car over here this
time

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
time

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.290 
time
me<00:03:31.560> let<00:03:32.010> me<00:03:32.100> zoom<00:03:32.280> out<00:03:32.430> about<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:33.090> about

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
me let me zoom out about just about

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
pick up the lines edge is better you see

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.790 
pick up the lines edge is better you see
versus<00:04:24.740> here<00:04:24.920> it's<00:04:25.040> all<00:04:25.190> blurred<00:04:25.520> out<00:04:26.800> let's

50<00:07:12.650> kilobytes<00:07:13.310> one<00:07:13.819> point<00:07:14.060> five<00:07:14.240> megabytes

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
50 kilobytes one point five megabytes

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.450 
50 kilobytes one point five megabytes
3.7<00:07:16.340> megabytes<00:07:16.849> um<00:07:17.210> where's<00:07:18.169> the<00:07:18.530> HTC<00:07:19.159> One<00:07:19.340> X

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
3.7 megabytes um where's the HTC One X

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.640 
3.7 megabytes um where's the HTC One X
does<00:07:19.759> one<00:07:19.940> point<00:07:20.180> eight<00:07:20.300> megabytes<00:07:20.599> so<00:07:21.409> this

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
does one point eight megabytes so this

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.610 
does one point eight megabytes so this
shows<00:07:21.889> you<00:07:22.250> that<00:07:22.460> the<00:07:22.819> HTC<00:07:23.779> One<00:07:23.990> X<00:07:24.169> does

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
shows you that the HTC One X does

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.179 
shows you that the HTC One X does
compress<00:07:25.279> its<00:07:25.840> images<00:07:26.840> more<00:07:27.139> and<00:07:27.379> that's<00:07:27.949> why

00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:28.189 
compress its images more and that's why

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:31.119 
compress its images more and that's why
maybe<00:07:28.729> you<00:07:28.969> lost<00:07:29.240> a<00:07:29.629> little<00:07:29.960> bit<00:07:30.139> of<00:07:30.199> image<00:07:30.740> but

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:31.129 
maybe you lost a little bit of image but

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.089 
maybe you lost a little bit of image but
the<00:07:31.250> Galaxy<00:07:31.789> Note<00:07:31.819> does<00:07:32.389> have<00:07:33.099> advantage

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:34.099 
the Galaxy Note does have advantage

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.879 
the Galaxy Note does have advantage
since<00:07:34.430> it<00:07:34.699> captured<00:07:35.419> in<00:07:35.990> a<00:07:36.289> little<00:07:36.620> bit<00:07:36.710> more

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
since it captured in a little bit more

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.029 
since it captured in a little bit more
detail<00:07:37.279> I<00:07:37.490> don't<00:07:37.639> know<00:07:37.699> how<00:07:37.789> that<00:07:37.819> works<00:07:38.509> um

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
detail I don't know how that works um

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.159 
detail I don't know how that works um
but<00:07:40.039> it<00:07:40.190> seems<00:07:40.400> put<00:07:40.789> pretty<00:07:41.090> clear<00:07:41.509> by<00:07:41.960> looking

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.169 
but it seems put pretty clear by looking

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.409 
but it seems put pretty clear by looking
at<00:07:42.379> the<00:07:42.560> images<00:07:42.979> that<00:07:43.340> the<00:07:43.490> Galaxy<00:07:43.969> Note<00:07:44.000> has<00:07:44.389> a

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:44.419 
at the images that the Galaxy Note has a

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:47.709 
at the images that the Galaxy Note has a
better<00:07:44.900> clear<00:07:45.440> with<00:07:46.310> bit<00:07:46.580> more<00:07:46.759> colors<00:07:47.240> so<00:07:47.690> I

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:47.719 
better clear with bit more colors so I

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:52.750 
better clear with bit more colors so I
just<00:07:47.960> want<00:07:48.169> to<00:07:48.349> add<00:07:48.500> that<00:07:49.750> anyway
