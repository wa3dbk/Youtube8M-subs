00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
entire game had it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.020

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
the golden bone breaker as an surprise

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.349 
the golden bone breaker as an surprise
in<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.290> contest<00:02:54.949> as<00:02:55.129> well<00:02:55.340> even<00:02:56.060> though<00:02:56.180> they

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
in that contest as well even though they

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.000
