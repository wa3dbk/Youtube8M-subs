to keep me on track and it was

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
to keep me on track and it was
completely<00:00:36.870> laid<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.320> there<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.829> no

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
completely laid out there was no

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.700 
completely laid out there was no
question<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.820> due<00:00:39.000> when<00:00:39.530> one<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
question what was due when one of the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
question what was due when one of the
courses<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.219> did<00:00:41.430> enjoy<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> one

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
courses that I did enjoy was the one

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
courses that I did enjoy was the one
that<00:00:42.870> did<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.620> databases<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that did go into the databases so that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.040 
that did go into the databases so that
we<00:00:44.789> could<00:00:44.969> compare<00:00:45.300> our<00:00:45.450> school<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> another

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
we could compare our school to another

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.260 
we could compare our school to another
school<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.460> nice<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.850> able<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> take

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
school it was nice to be able to take

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
school it was nice to be able to take
the<00:00:48.420> demographics<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> compare

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the demographics and really to compare

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
the demographics and really to compare
them<00:00:50.190> equally<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.390> want<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
them equally because you don't want to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.939 
them equally because you don't want to
pull<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.930> school<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.920> the

middle<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.550> Illinois<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.420> compare<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
middle of Illinois and then compare it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.090 
middle of Illinois and then compare it
to<00:00:54.899> an<00:00:55.020> inner-city<00:00:55.140> school<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:55.949> it's

to an inner-city school because it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
there too and it was interesting to find

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
there too and it was interesting to find
out<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:23.130> based

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
out that it was the way it was all based

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.789 
out that it was the way it was all based
on<00:01:23.729> how<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.420> managed<00:01:25.080> their<00:01:25.200> school<00:01:25.619> and

on how they managed their school and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that's one of the problems at CP I don't

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.859 
that's one of the problems at CP I don't
to<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> problems<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.540> we

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to say that one of the problems that we

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
to say that one of the problems that we
face<00:01:30.900> every<00:01:31.290> day<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.570> classroom

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
face every day is the classroom

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
face every day is the classroom
management<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> schools<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> think

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
management of the schools so I think

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630 
management of the schools so I think

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
to get on these you know making policies

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.710 
to get on these you know making policies
that<00:01:47.399> stick<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.119> say<00:01:48.299> okay<00:01:48.509> we're<00:01:48.630> going

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720

to start giving them you know detentions

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.160 
to start giving them you know detentions
for<00:01:50.520> tardy<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.990> things

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like that and I said I think that if we

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
like that and I said I think that if we
start<00:01:54.479> doing<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.500> some<00:01:55.710> school

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
start doing that and to get some school

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
start doing that and to get some school

kids a sense of being and I think that

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.059 
kids a sense of being and I think that
that<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:06.960> nice<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.619> started

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that but it was nice that that started

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.249 
that but it was nice that that started
all<00:02:08.190> from<00:02:08.459> me<00:02:08.670> comparing<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.810> school<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
all from me comparing my school to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
all from me comparing my school to
another<00:02:10.379> school<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.220> saying<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
another school and saying one of the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.370 
another school and saying one of the
things<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.840> half<00:02:13.080> school

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
things they do is a half school

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.930 
things they do is a half school
spirit<00:02:13.740> they<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:14.070> these<00:02:14.310> other<00:02:14.550> things<00:02:14.820> that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
spirit they have these other things that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.510 
spirit they have these other things that
they<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> progress<00:02:17.070> monitors

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
they can do I like the progress monitors

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.250 
they can do I like the progress monitors
I<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.000> helps<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:19.050> back

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
I think that that helps you to go back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.810 
I think that that helps you to go back
and<00:02:19.290> review<00:02:19.920> after<00:02:20.160> you've<00:02:20.370> gone<00:02:20.520> through<00:02:20.760> the
