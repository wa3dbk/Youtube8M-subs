00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.460
 hello dear friends welcome to me 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.890
 channel my name is used and the day of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 Today I 'm going to talk about the spots in 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.529
 the hands spots or freckles spots 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.930
 dark spots horrible spots 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.660
 detestable that come to us in the hands 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.779
 products of solar rays products 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.770
 of not having used our sunscreen 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.430
 only blocker on the skin 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.810
 around on the forehead on lips 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.660
 all moisturizers and we forget about 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:43.950
 our hands keep in mind that a 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 from 30 30 35 40 and onwards 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.250
 those freckles appear on the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.650
 hands so that sometimes our 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.680
 moms or our grandmothers do not and always 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.880
 it's something natural something that comes out to everyone and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.740
 it is not something natural 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.530
 first of all it can be a start of the 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.079
 second cancer is something that comes out 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.900
 by the direct contact of the rays 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.980
 solar in our skin 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.110
 so in my case I was good 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.080
 they were showing up enough clues 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.630
 according to the unfaithful good one here I can show you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.230
 for example that there is a look a good 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.140
 notorious and around my entire skin 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.210
 they were so pretty of these little 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.660
 then one day I write with the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.390
 right but I had my hand here between 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.160
 that copied between what I wrote and I see 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 spots on my skin I say it's 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.590
 thinking because because it comes out is 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.970
 I also had this throughout this this 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.860
 new lunar 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.890
 This is a stain product of the sun 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.800
 then this had here in all the skin 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.200
 so I said it's happening to me 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.910
 they could really believe it because sometimes 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.520
 one is dedicated to studying to do his 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.100
 things to do your daily routine and forget 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.170
 you forget your hands these hands 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.970
 wonderful who help you 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.680
 feed you that help you 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.050
 inspired every job 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.250
 but you also have to thank 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.190
 your hands that if God allowed you 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.270
 have your ten fingers have your hands 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.800
 then take care of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.680
 they have to be very careful with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.580
 the sun's rays in my case I have a 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 50 factor sunscreen line 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.410
 61 that I use it on my face but at 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.200
 once also now I use it in my 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.580
 hands as a result of that I had to have this 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.100
 problem look at spots on the hands and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.120
 also look at the arms can 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.210
 show me here look at all these 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.700
 little spots that come out of the sun 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.920
 so I use a lot of 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.709
 these I buy about 56 when they go out in 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.670
 offer and I use quite because the sun 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.459
 as much as it does not appear the same 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.380
 is mistreating and although you do not believe it 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.930
 you have to take care of yourself and protect your skin 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.840
 very apart from the face and I am 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.860

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.740
