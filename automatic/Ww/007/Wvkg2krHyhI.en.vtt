00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
jumper this is kind of like a loose-knit

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
jumper this is kind of like a loose-knit
jumper<00:02:02.040> which<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.430> slightly<00:02:03.299> see-through<00:02:03.540> but

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
jumper which is slightly see-through but

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.410 
jumper which is slightly see-through but
I<00:02:04.079> would<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.439> wear<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.649> with<00:02:04.950> say<00:02:05.189> jeans<00:02:06.030> or

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
I would just wear it with say jeans or

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.449 
I would just wear it with say jeans or
black<00:02:06.450> jeans<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.770> tank<00:02:07.950> top<00:02:08.160> underneath

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
black jeans and a tank top underneath

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.639 
black jeans and a tank top underneath
what<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.569> about<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.989> jumper<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
what I like about this jumper is that

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.960 
what I like about this jumper is that
it's

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
it's

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.450 
it's
have<00:02:11.180> sculpted<00:02:11.870> if<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.530> look<00:02:12.680> at<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.070> detail

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
have sculpted if you look at the detail

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.610 
have sculpted if you look at the detail
in<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.640> front<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.090> looks<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.620> an

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
in the front it kind of looks like an

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.440 
in the front it kind of looks like an
hourglass<00:02:16.190> shape<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.970> really<00:02:17.120> helps<00:02:17.390> to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
hourglass shape so it really helps to

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.850 
hourglass shape so it really helps to
kind<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.690> accentuate<00:02:17.990> your<00:02:18.200> figure<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
kind of accentuate your figure all the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.830 
kind of accentuate your figure all the
time<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.220> baggy<00:02:19.400> jumpers<00:02:19.970> they<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.660> just

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
time with baggy jumpers they can just

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.150 
time with baggy jumpers they can just
make<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.140> look<00:02:21.200> like<00:02:21.440> you're<00:02:21.590> wearing<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:21.980> huge

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
make you look like you're wearing a huge

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.520 
make you look like you're wearing a huge
jumper<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.210> just<00:02:23.390> does<00:02:23.720> not<00:02:23.750> flatter<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
jumper and it just does not flatter the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.440 
jumper and it just does not flatter the
figure<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.550> really<00:02:25.820> like<00:02:26.000> this<00:02:26.210> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
figure but I really like this the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.870 
figure but I really like this the

and I loosen it only in only in on the
inside<00:02:47.050> yeah<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.620> was<00:02:49.120> 35<00:02:50.120> pounds<00:02:50.900> which

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
inside yeah and this was 35 pounds which

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.580 
inside yeah and this was 35 pounds which
was<00:02:51.260> fairly<00:02:51.560> expensive<00:02:52.040> but<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.420> find<00:02:54.170> nice

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
was fairly expensive but I find nice

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.470 
was fairly expensive but I find nice
quality<00:02:55.190> knitwear<00:02:55.490> it's<00:02:55.670> quite<00:02:55.820> hard<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.300> find

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
quality knitwear it's quite hard to find

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.360 
quality knitwear it's quite hard to find
like<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.959> lot<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.320> knitwear<00:02:57.650> designs<00:02:58.100> and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
like a lot of the knitwear designs and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.310 
like a lot of the knitwear designs and
hmm<00:02:58.730> are<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:59.030> nice<00:02:59.209> but<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.020> actual

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
hmm are really nice but the actual

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.800 
hmm are really nice but the actual
material<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:01.040> sometimes<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.940> little<00:03:02.240> cheap

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
material can sometimes be a little cheap

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.600 
material can sometimes be a little cheap
so<00:03:03.050> when<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.380> wash<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.920> tends<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.250> shrink

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
so when you wash it it tends to shrink

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.400 
so when you wash it it tends to shrink
or<00:03:04.850> if<00:03:05.209> you're<00:03:05.450> not<00:03:05.660> really<00:03:05.900> careful<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.260> might

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
or if you're not really careful I might

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.680 
or if you're not really careful I might
have<00:03:06.560> or<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.010> tends<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.310> shrink<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:08.480> this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
have or it tends to shrink and this

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.420 
have or it tends to shrink and this
is<00:03:08.840> actually<00:03:09.080> really<00:03:09.230> nice<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.470> soft<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.190> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
is actually really nice and soft so I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.490

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
up a bracelet or a bangle from H&amp;M which

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.260 
up a bracelet or a bangle from H&amp;M which
I<00:04:27.340> thought<00:04:27.460> was<00:04:27.580> really<00:04:27.639> pretty

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
I thought was really pretty

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.439 
I thought was really pretty
it's<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> double<00:04:29.370> gold<00:04:30.370> bangle<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.300> it's

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
it's like a double gold bangle and it's

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.180 
it's like a double gold bangle and it's
joined<00:04:31.720> together<00:04:31.930> by<00:04:32.199> these<00:04:32.919> kind<00:04:33.130> of

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
joined together by these kind of

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.070 
joined together by these kind of
gemstones<00:04:33.729> what<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.389> really<00:04:34.630> like<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:35.050> that

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
gemstones what I really like is that

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.779 
gemstones what I really like is that
when<00:04:35.259> you<00:04:35.380> put<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.860> they<00:04:36.100> don't<00:04:36.340> meet<00:04:36.580> up

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
when you put this on they don't meet up

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.360 
when you put this on they don't meet up
so<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.240> almost<00:04:37.389> like<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.810> have<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.139> little

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
so it's almost like you have this little

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.070 
so it's almost like you have this little
gemstone<00:04:39.370> adornment<00:04:39.940> on<00:04:40.120> your<00:04:40.300> wrist<00:04:40.479> I'll

so you can see what I'm talking about

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.120 
so you can see what I'm talking about
but<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.930> thought<00:04:44.380> that<00:04:44.560> was<00:04:44.680> really<00:04:44.800> pretty

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
but I thought that was really pretty

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.060 
but I thought that was really pretty
again<00:04:45.370> $5.99<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.389> quite<00:04:46.570> affordable<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.259> I

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
again $5.99 so quite affordable and I

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.230 
again $5.99 so quite affordable and I
thought<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.310> would<00:04:48.430> go<00:04:48.610> with<00:04:48.789> a<00:04:48.820> lot<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.060> things

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
thought it would go with a lot of things

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.700 
thought it would go with a lot of things
as<00:04:49.419> well<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.840> have<00:04:49.990> quite<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.229> lot<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.440> gold

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
as well I have quite a lot of gold

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.439 
as well I have quite a lot of gold
jewelry<00:04:50.979> so<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.550> thought<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.060> would<00:04:52.180> be<00:04:52.270> good

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
jewelry so I thought it would be good

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.439 
jewelry so I thought it would be good
just<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:54.220> kind<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.520> mix<00:04:54.789> up<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.150> layer<00:04:55.330> up

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
just to kind of mix up and layer up

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.820 
just to kind of mix up and layer up
because<00:04:55.930> it's<00:04:56.080> quite<00:04:56.289> a<00:04:56.320> subtle

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
because it's quite a subtle

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.439 
because it's quite a subtle
piece<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.669> thought<00:04:57.789> it<00:04:57.850> would<00:04:57.970> look<00:04:58.030> nice<00:04:58.240> next

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
piece I thought it would look nice next

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.850 
piece I thought it would look nice next
to<00:04:58.630> other<00:04:58.840> pieces<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.620> then<00:05:01.530> last<00:05:02.530> but<00:05:02.740> not

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
to other pieces and then last but not

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.219 
to other pieces and then last but not
least<00:05:03.190> on<00:05:03.490> fashion<00:05:03.970> freud's<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.600> did<00:05:04.930> say<00:05:05.080> I

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
least on fashion freud's I did say I

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.570 
least on fashion freud's I did say I

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
think that was gonna be a huge haul but

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.029 
think that was gonna be a huge haul but
it<00:05:06.699> is<00:05:06.850> like<00:05:07.330> that's<00:05:08.110> like<00:05:08.289> really<00:05:08.530> like<00:05:08.800> I

it is like that's like really like I
