00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
three different viewing angles that

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.180 
three different viewing angles that
you're<00:00:35.640> supposed<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.200> viewing<00:00:37.200> touching

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you're supposed to have viewing touching

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.639 
you're supposed to have viewing touching
and<00:00:38.399> typing<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.570> will<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:40.200> these<00:00:40.410> work

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and typing so we will see how these work

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
and typing so we will see how these work
out<00:00:40.890> oh<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:56.539> there<00:00:57.539> we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
out oh and there we have it and there we

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.009 
out oh and there we have it and there we
go

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
go

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.020 
go
so<00:00:58.230> looks<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.129> pop<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.640> open<00:00:59.730> like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so looks like we just pop it open like

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.970 
so looks like we just pop it open like
this<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.660> magnetically<00:01:01.670> sealed

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
this this is magnetically sealed

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.719 
this this is magnetically sealed
and<00:01:08.360> have<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.659> cushion<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.729> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and have a little cushion in there and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.960 
and have a little cushion in there and
again<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> different<00:01:12.750> viewing<00:01:12.960> angles

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
again just the different viewing angles

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
again just the different viewing angles
alright<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> might<00:01:15.420> want

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
alright so you might want

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
alright so you might want
we're<00:01:16.320> wondering<00:01:16.799> how<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> put<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> on

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
we're wondering how do you put this on

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
we're wondering how do you put this on
well<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.020> has<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.530> these<00:01:19.799> buttons

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
well it all has to do with these buttons

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.140 
well it all has to do with these buttons
so<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:21.570> buttons<00:01:21.960> fit<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.310> Galaxy<00:01:23.759> Tab<00:01:23.939> A

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so these buttons fit on the Galaxy Tab A

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.359 
so these buttons fit on the Galaxy Tab A
right<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.799> people<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:26.250> these

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
right there a lot of people think these

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
right there a lot of people think these
are<00:01:26.430> function<00:01:27.090> buttons<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.689> actually

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
are function buttons but actually

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
are function buttons but actually
they're<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> Samsung<00:01:29.310> cases<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
they're just for the Samsung cases so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.230 
they're just for the Samsung cases so
kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> click<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:33.020> on<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:35.520> case<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
kind of click it down on the case and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.170 
kind of click it down on the case and
you<00:01:36.329> clear<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> click<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you clear that click and on there you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.969 
you clear that click and on there you
click<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:44.149> click<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> in

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
click it right there and you click it in

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.630 
click it right there and you click it in
now<00:01:46.979> once<00:01:47.280> clicked<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:49.640> case

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
now once clicked in you have your case

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.959 
now once clicked in you have your case
very<00:01:51.020> simple<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.140> easy<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:53.159> slicing<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
very simple and easy on slicing it's a

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.670 
very simple and easy on slicing it's a
little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.329> difficult<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.960> put<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.439> though

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
little bit difficult to put it on though

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.050 
little bit difficult to put it on though
I<00:01:55.710> would<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> say<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> easiest

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I would have to say it's not the easiest

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.010 
I would have to say it's not the easiest
thing<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:58.350> once<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.960> now<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
thing to do but once you have it now you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
thing to do but once you have it now you
can<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.590> different<00:02:02.039> viewing<00:02:02.340> angles

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
can have your different viewing angles

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.819 
can have your different viewing angles
which<00:02:02.880> let's<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.299> how<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:03.689> worked<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.560> we

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
which let's see how they worked so we

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.350 
which let's see how they worked so we
had<00:02:05.070> our<00:02:05.460> typing<00:02:06.390> 1<00:02:06.630> which<00:02:07.289> is<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.360> we

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
had our typing 1 which is like this we

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.130 
had our typing 1 which is like this we
had<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.289> viewing<00:02:11.070> one<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.120> believe<00:02:12.480> was

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
had the viewing one which I believe was

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.809 
had the viewing one which I believe was
like<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:15.320> then<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:17.070> have

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
like this and then we have

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.619 
like this and then we have
the<00:02:18.650> other<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.519> not<00:02:21.269> sure<00:02:21.450> which

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
the other one which not sure which

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.140 
the other one which not sure which
combination<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.379> was<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.219> yeah<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.819> kind

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
combination that was but yeah it's kind

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.479 
combination that was but yeah it's kind
of<00:02:24.299> interesting<00:02:24.959> how<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.409> figure<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.069> these

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
of interesting how you figure all these

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.599 
of interesting how you figure all these
kind<00:02:26.939> of<00:02:27.030> view<00:02:27.329> angles<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.249> can<00:02:29.400> play

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
kind of view angles out but you can play

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.399 
kind of view angles out but you can play
around<00:02:29.639> with<00:02:29.909> it<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.389> really<00:02:30.659> feel<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:31.170> which

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
around with it and really feel out which

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.280 
around with it and really feel out which
ones<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:32.819> pretty<00:02:33.599> much<00:02:33.719> would<00:02:33.989> just

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
ones you like I pretty much would just

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.879 
ones you like I pretty much would just
use<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.989> jingle<00:02:36.989> like<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.980> where<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:39.209> have

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
use the jingle like this where you have

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:45.110
