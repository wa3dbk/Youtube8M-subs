here<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.079> indicate<00:00:48.500> our<00:00:48.800> light<00:00:49.160> source<00:00:50.020> look

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
here to indicate our light source look

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.890 
here to indicate our light source look
somewhat<00:00:51.440> like<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:52.040> light<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.540> then<00:00:53.540> I'll<00:00:53.690> put

where<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.369> light<00:01:37.609> is<00:01:38.119> coming<00:01:38.479> from<00:01:38.689> as<00:01:38.899> well

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
where that light is coming from as well

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.749

things<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.000> want<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.149> keep<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.390> mind<00:01:53.540> when

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
things you want to keep in mind when

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:54.969 
things you want to keep in mind when
you're<00:01:53.780> using<00:01:53.840> your<00:01:54.110> colored<00:01:54.500> pencils<00:01:54.860> you

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
you're using your colored pencils you

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.380 
you're using your colored pencils you
want<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.159> make<00:01:55.280> sure<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.729> really<00:01:55.939> glaber

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
want to make sure that you really glaber

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.330 
want to make sure that you really glaber
the<00:01:56.720> colors<00:01:57.110> really<00:01:57.500> build<00:01:57.799> up<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.130> color

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
the colors really build up the color

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.910 
the colors really build up the color
what<00:01:59.240> we're<00:01:59.360> going<00:01:59.630> for<00:01:59.659> here<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.409> an

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
what we're going for here is a an

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.810 
what we're going for here is a an
appearance<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.909> pretty<00:02:02.659> solid<00:02:03.369> surface<00:02:04.369> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
appearance of a pretty solid surface so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.749 
appearance of a pretty solid surface so
we'll<00:02:05.330> slowly<00:02:05.689> layer<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.380> colors<00:02:06.770> build<00:02:07.610> them

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
we'll slowly layer the colors build them

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.690 
we'll slowly layer the colors build them
up<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.149> eventually<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.920> color<00:02:10.340> will<00:02:10.519> look

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
up and eventually the color will look

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.870 
up and eventually the color will look
heavy<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:11.989> want<00:02:12.380> layer<00:02:12.560> colors<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.370> color

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
heavy so you want layer colors and color

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.640 
heavy so you want layer colors and color
heavy<00:02:14.300> those<00:02:14.630> are<00:02:14.780> two<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.110> tips<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
heavy those are two of the tips that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.040 
heavy those are two of the tips that
I've<00:02:15.890> suggested<00:02:16.160> here<00:02:16.880> when<00:02:17.780> you're<00:02:17.900> using

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
I've suggested here when you're using

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.410 
I've suggested here when you're using
color<00:02:18.349> pencils<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.580> I'm<00:02:19.880> keeping<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.299> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
color pencils so I'm keeping with the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.830 
color pencils so I'm keeping with the
red

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
red

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.710 
red
I'm<00:02:21.260> keeping<00:02:21.920> sure<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.580> apply<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.030> red<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I'm keeping sure that I apply the red a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.170 
I'm keeping sure that I apply the red a
little<00:02:24.620> best<00:02:25.010> heavy<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> side<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
little best heavy on the side that the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.059 
little best heavy on the side that the
light<00:02:26.360> source<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.660> coming<00:02:26.810> from<00:02:27.110> that's

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
light source is coming from that's

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.860 
light source is coming from that's
because<00:02:28.400> I'm<00:02:28.519> planning<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.030> going<00:02:29.209> back<00:02:29.540> with

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
because I'm planning on going back with

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.530 
because I'm planning on going back with
some<00:02:30.410> white<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.459> some<00:02:31.519> yellows<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.480> greens

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
some white and some yellows and greens

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.479 
some white and some yellows and greens
and<00:02:32.930> other<00:02:33.110> colors<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.099> don't<00:02:34.280> want<00:02:34.430> to

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
and other colors and I don't want to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.789 
and other colors and I don't want to
cover<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.849> up<00:02:34.940> heavy<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.989> start<00:02:36.349> with<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.650> want

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
cover it up heavy to start with I want

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.160 
cover it up heavy to start with I want
to<00:02:36.830> build<00:02:37.040> up<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.250> heavy<00:02:37.760> appearance<00:02:38.420> so

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
to build up that heavy appearance so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.500 
to build up that heavy appearance so
that's<00:02:39.560> why<00:02:39.769> I'm<00:02:39.920> putting<00:02:40.190> light<00:02:40.610> layers<00:02:41.060> of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
that's why I'm putting light layers of

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.699 
that's why I'm putting light layers of
the<00:02:42.230> color<00:02:42.470> pencil<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.160> paper<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:45.049> cover

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
the color pencil on the paper so cover

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.270 
the color pencil on the paper so cover
the<00:02:45.860> whole<00:02:45.980> surface<00:02:46.430> with<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.150> red<00:02:47.360> here<00:02:47.870> and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the whole surface with the red here and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.920 
the whole surface with the red here and
then<00:02:49.280> I'm<00:02:49.459> ready<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> go<00:02:50.120> with<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.269> lighter<00:02:50.599> red

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
then I'm ready to go with a lighter red

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.569 
then I'm ready to go with a lighter red
and<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.380> going<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> start<00:02:51.799> on<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.100> side<00:02:52.310> with

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
and I'm going to start on the side with

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.729 
and I'm going to start on the side with
my<00:02:52.790> where<00:02:53.720> my<00:02:53.840> light<00:02:54.019> source<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.410> coming<00:02:54.440> from

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
my where my light source is coming from

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.920 
my where my light source is coming from
that<00:02:54.890> lighter<00:02:55.310> red<00:02:55.579> and<00:02:55.850> I'm<00:02:55.940> slowly<00:02:56.359> building

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
that lighter red and I'm slowly building

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.009 
that lighter red and I'm slowly building
up<00:02:57.140> how<00:02:57.500> heavy<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:57.980> apply<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:59.150> color<00:02:59.420> pencil<00:02:59.870> to

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
up how heavy I apply the color pencil to

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.650 
up how heavy I apply the color pencil to
the<00:03:00.140> surface<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:01.670> I'm<00:03:01.850> starting<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.600> a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the surface here I'm starting to get a

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.949 
the surface here I'm starting to get a
little<00:03:03.019> heavier<00:03:03.680> with<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.010> color<00:03:04.220> pencil

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
little heavier with the color pencil

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.559 
little heavier with the color pencil
keeping<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.109> mind<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:07.519> want<00:03:07.940> my<00:03:08.090> finished

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
keeping in mind that I want my finished

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.360 
keeping in mind that I want my finished
image<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:09.170> look<00:03:09.350> very<00:03:09.489> solid<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.670> heavy

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.380 

and<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.629> we<00:03:16.750> go<00:03:17.340> I'm<00:03:18.340> going<00:03:18.459> back<00:03:18.849> with<00:03:18.879> that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
and there we go I'm going back with that

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.030 
and there we go I'm going back with that
dark<00:03:19.720> brown<00:03:19.959> I'm<00:03:20.319> going<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.500> indicate<00:03:20.709> where

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
dark brown I'm going to indicate where

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.490 
dark brown I'm going to indicate where
the<00:03:21.129> stem<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.430> before<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.000> go<00:03:22.209> too<00:03:22.269> far<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.080> go

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
the stem is before I go too far you go

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.750 
the stem is before I go too far you go
too<00:03:23.739> far<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.129> going<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.310> be<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> little<00:03:24.640> bit

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
too far it's going to be a little bit

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.880 
too far it's going to be a little bit
difficult<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.569> go<00:03:26.050> back<00:03:26.080> over<00:03:26.560> what<00:03:26.709> you've

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
difficult to go back over what you've

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.250 
difficult to go back over what you've
already<00:03:27.010> done<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.480> set<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:28.690> draw<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:29.050> Tim

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
already done so set it and draw this Tim

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.570 
already done so set it and draw this Tim
in<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.379> beginning<00:03:29.739> I'll<00:03:29.860> go<00:03:29.980> back<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.400> add

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
in the beginning I'll go back and add

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.910 
in the beginning I'll go back and add
that<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:32.049> I'm<00:03:32.170> going<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.349> make<00:03:32.560> some<00:03:32.799> of

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
that and then I'm going to make some of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.729 
that and then I'm going to make some of
my<00:03:33.040> darker<00:03:33.519> values<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> little<00:03:34.360> bit<00:03:34.660> darker<00:03:35.170> by

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
my darker values a little bit darker by

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.039 
my darker values a little bit darker by
going<00:03:36.010> back<00:03:36.190> over<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.670> dark<00:03:37.060> brown<00:03:37.269> may

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
going back over with the dark brown may

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.839 
going back over with the dark brown may
look<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.410> I'm<00:03:38.590> using<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:39.040> black<00:03:39.280> but<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
look like I'm using a black but it's a

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
doing is I'm creating a more complex

doing is I'm creating a more complex
look<00:04:51.490> about<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.880> Apple<00:04:52.240> I'm<00:04:52.900> making<00:04:53.380> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
look about the Apple I'm making the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.290 
look about the Apple I'm making the
colors<00:04:53.770> look<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.220> little<00:04:54.430> bit<00:04:54.670> more<00:04:54.880> like<00:04:55.120> they

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
colors look a little bit more like they

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.960 
colors look a little bit more like they
look<00:04:55.600> in<00:04:55.750> reality<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:57.310> I'm<00:04:57.490> also<00:04:57.670> being

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
look in reality and I'm also being

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.610 
look in reality and I'm also being
careful<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.660> make<00:04:58.840> sure<00:04:59.020> they<00:04:59.170> don't<00:04:59.260> cover<00:04:59.530> up

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
careful to make sure they don't cover up

the areas that I plan on highlighting in

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.520 
the areas that I plan on highlighting in
just<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.950> few<00:05:03.190> moments<00:05:03.840> going<00:05:04.840> back<00:05:05.110> over<00:05:05.290> with

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
just a few moments going back over with

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.770 
just a few moments going back over with
a<00:05:05.560> red<00:05:05.830> now<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.880> point<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.450> start<00:05:07.480> to

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
a red now and this point I can start to

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.630 
a red now and this point I can start to
get<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:07.930> little<00:05:08.230> heavier<00:05:08.650> with<00:05:08.800> my<00:05:08.950> application

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
get a little heavier with my application

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.520

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
with the colored pencil that will also

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.170 
with the colored pencil that will also
aid<00:05:38.000> in<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:39.230> realistic<00:05:40.220> qualities<00:05:40.910> of<00:05:40.940> your
