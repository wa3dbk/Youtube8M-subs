just give them your treat so then just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.030 
just give them your treat so then just
keep<00:01:29.210> practicing<00:01:29.990> having<00:01:30.350> them<00:01:30.470> jump<00:01:30.770> over

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
keep practicing having them jump over

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.279 
keep practicing having them jump over
the<00:01:31.160> hurdle

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.380 

once<00:01:41.289> they<00:01:41.649> jumped<00:01:42.460> over<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:43.060> couple<00:01:43.270> of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
once they jumped over it a couple of

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.389 
once they jumped over it a couple of
times<00:01:43.659> kind<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.229> gotten<00:01:44.439> used<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.920> then

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
times kind of gotten used to it then

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.310 
times kind of gotten used to it then
just<00:01:45.640> start<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.909> try<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.270> lure<00:01:46.539> them<00:01:46.810> over<00:01:47.259> it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
just start to try and lure them over it

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:59.110 
just start to try and lure them over it
with<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.649> treat

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.580 

so<00:02:00.120> once<00:02:00.330> they've<00:02:00.510> mastered<00:02:00.780> jumping<00:02:01.350> over

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so once they've mastered jumping over

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160 
so once they've mastered jumping over
one<00:02:01.890> hurdle<00:02:02.159> go<00:02:02.850> ahead<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> grab<00:02:03.750> another<00:02:03.780> one

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
one hurdle go ahead and grab another one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.100 
one hurdle go ahead and grab another one
and<00:02:04.560> place<00:02:05.100> them<00:02:05.370> fairly<00:02:05.910> close<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.050> each

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and place them fairly close to each

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.949 
and place them fairly close to each
other<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:08.220> you're<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> try<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.479> get

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
other so you're just going to try to get

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.420 
other so you're just going to try to get
your<00:02:10.050> dribble<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.470> jump<00:02:10.709> over<00:02:10.950> one<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
your dribble to jump over one and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.990 
your dribble to jump over one and
immediately<00:02:11.490> jump<00:02:12.090> over<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> other<00:02:12.660> one

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.190 

so<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.210> goal<00:02:21.420> here<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.780> try<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.500> them<00:02:22.770> to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
so the goal here is try to get them to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.410 
so the goal here is try to get them to
just<00:02:25.200> jump<00:02:25.590> over<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.400> obstacles<00:02:26.730> then

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
just jump over a lot of obstacles then

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.480 
just jump over a lot of obstacles then
get<00:02:27.600> rewarded<00:02:28.110> instead<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.860> jumping<00:02:29.010> over<00:02:29.280> one

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
get rewarded instead of jumping over one

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.340 
get rewarded instead of jumping over one

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.120 

so<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.700> tip<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.300> you'll<00:03:20.990> you<00:03:21.590> kind<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.890> want<00:03:22.040> to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
so a tip is you'll you kind of want to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.890 
so a tip is you'll you kind of want to
block<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.580> sides<00:03:22.850> when<00:03:23.270> they're<00:03:23.420> going<00:03:23.630> over

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
block the sides when they're going over

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.380 
block the sides when they're going over
an<00:03:24.680> obstacle<00:03:24.920> because<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.760> prevents<00:03:26.120> them

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
an obstacle because of prevents them

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.440 
an obstacle because of prevents them
from<00:03:26.420> going<00:03:26.840> anywhere<00:03:27.200> else<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.000> they<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.270> to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
from going anywhere else so they have to

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.840 
from going anywhere else so they have to
either<00:03:29.540> jump<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.230> go<00:03:30.440> through<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.980> climb<00:03:31.580> it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
either jump it go through it climb it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.450 
either jump it go through it climb it
and<00:03:32.030> then<00:03:32.720> once<00:03:33.290> they<00:03:33.500> get<00:03:33.680> used<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.130> you

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
and then once they get used to that you

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.950 
and then once they get used to that you
don't<00:03:34.610> have<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.940> block<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.360> anymore<00:03:35.600> and

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
don't have to block it anymore and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.360 
don't have to block it anymore and
