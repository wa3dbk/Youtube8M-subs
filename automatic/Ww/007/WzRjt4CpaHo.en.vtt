00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
I could do is to go ahead not go

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.780 
I could do is to go ahead not go
backwards<00:06:18.390> but<00:06:18.930> go<00:06:19.110> ahead<00:06:19.230> and<00:06:19.790> create

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
backwards but go ahead and create

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.320 
backwards but go ahead and create
whatever<00:06:21.630> I<00:06:21.690> want<00:06:21.930> to<00:06:22.050> create<00:06:22.470> to<00:06:23.330> negate

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
whatever I want to create to negate

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.630 
whatever I want to create to negate
something<00:06:24.840> that's<00:06:25.020> in<00:06:25.350> the<00:06:25.470> past<00:06:25.650> that<00:06:26.610> I

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
something that's in the past that I

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.830 
something that's in the past that I
would<00:06:26.850> think<00:06:27.030> of

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
would think of

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.930 
would think of
but<00:06:28.050> do<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.500> have<00:06:28.830> something<00:06:29.130> like<00:06:29.400> that<00:06:29.550> we<00:06:29.820> all

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
but do I have something like that we all

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.260 
but do I have something like that we all
do<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.440> I<00:06:31.440> think<00:06:32.310> it's<00:06:32.580> it's<00:06:32.790> just<00:06:33.060> it's

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
do and I think it's it's just it's

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.540 
do and I think it's it's just it's
possible<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.840> create<00:06:34.100> exactly<00:06:35.100> the<00:06:35.370> world

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
possible to create exactly the world

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.510 
possible to create exactly the world
that<00:06:35.699> you<00:06:35.790> want<00:06:36.000> to<00:06:36.090> live<00:06:36.240> in<00:06:37.010> if<00:06:38.010> you<00:06:38.130> can<00:06:38.280> just

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
that you want to live in if you can just

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.790 
that you want to live in if you can just
see<00:06:39.030> it<00:06:39.090> very<00:06:39.210> clearly<00:06:39.330> in<00:06:39.660> your<00:06:39.750> head<00:06:39.960> and<00:06:40.139> go

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
see it very clearly in your head and go

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.460
