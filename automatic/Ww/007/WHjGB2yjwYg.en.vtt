three<00:01:12.340> meaning<00:01:12.730> before<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.450> kidney<00:01:15.870> intra

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.460 

inside<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.400> kidneys<00:01:25.060> actually<00:01:25.900> fix<00:01:26.230> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
inside the kidneys actually fix the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.880 
inside the kidneys actually fix the
actual<00:01:27.070> kidney<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.970> here<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.480> have<00:01:29.100> post

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.399 

okay<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.549> things<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.090> would<00:01:39.240> affect<00:01:39.409> Priya

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
okay so things that would affect Priya

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.889 
okay so things that would affect Priya
renal<00:01:40.950> failure<00:01:41.909> would<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.329> something<00:01:42.749> like

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
renal failure would be something like

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.459 
renal failure would be something like
again<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.499> you<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:43.740> stabbed<00:01:44.130> shot<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.140> you're

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
again if you get stabbed shot and you're

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.249 
again if you get stabbed shot and you're
just<00:01:46.710> bleeding<00:01:47.069> out<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.579> kinds<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.299> blood

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
just bleeding out all kinds of blood

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.529 
just bleeding out all kinds of blood
what<00:01:49.920> ii<00:01:50.250> into<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:50.880> cause<00:01:51.350> hypo

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
what ii into is going to cause hypo

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.389 
what ii into is going to cause hypo
bulimia<00:01:54.539> or<00:01:55.880> decrease<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:58.130> blood<00:01:59.130> volume

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
bulimia or decrease and blood volume

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.429 
bulimia or decrease and blood volume
which<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.789> same<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.240> which<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:01.049> result

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
which the same thing which will result

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.399 
which the same thing which will result
in<00:02:01.649> decreased<00:02:02.219> blood<00:02:03.179> pressure<00:02:03.599> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.200> have

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
in decreased blood pressure if you have

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.339 
in decreased blood pressure if you have
TVs<00:02:04.859> blood<00:02:05.159> volume<00:02:05.369> decrease<00:02:06.030> blood<00:02:06.240> pressure

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
TVs blood volume decrease blood pressure

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.539 
TVs blood volume decrease blood pressure
then<00:02:07.349> the<00:02:07.530> amount<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.920> blood<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.399> coming

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
then the amount of blood that's coming

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.160 
then the amount of blood that's coming
here<00:02:10.790> decreases<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.480> kidney<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.930> getting

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
here decreases so the kidney is getting

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.990 
here decreases so the kidney is getting
less<00:02:13.470> blood<00:02:13.799> another<00:02:14.579> thing<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.910> could

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
less blood another thing that could

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.670 
less blood another thing that could
happen<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.450> maybe<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> blood<00:02:16.410> clot

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
happen is maybe you have a blood clot

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.490 
happen is maybe you have a blood clot
and<00:02:17.060> embolus<00:02:18.470> blood<00:02:19.470> clot<00:02:19.680> gets<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and embolus blood clot gets here and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.039 
and embolus blood clot gets here and
approves<00:02:22.500> any<00:02:22.950> blood<00:02:23.579> from<00:02:23.760> getting<00:02:24.060> into<00:02:24.239> the

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
approves any blood from getting into the

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.819 
approves any blood from getting into the
kidney<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:26.010> would<00:02:26.220> again<00:02:26.489> result<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.120> renal

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
kidney this would again result in renal

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.619 
kidney this would again result in renal
ish<00:02:29.989> or<00:02:31.670> decreased<00:02:32.670> oxygenation<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
ish or decreased oxygenation to that

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.199 
ish or decreased oxygenation to that
kidney<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> would<00:02:34.859> be<00:02:34.890> Korea<00:02:35.879> being<00:02:36.060> on

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
kidney so that would be Korea being on

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.470 
kidney so that would be Korea being on
intro<00:02:37.200> torino<00:02:37.670> again<00:02:38.670> meaning<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.150> decide

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
intro torino again meaning you decide

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.449 
intro torino again meaning you decide
the<00:02:39.629> kidney<00:02:39.959> bikinis<00:02:40.709> affected<00:02:41.160> something

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
the kidney bikinis affected something

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.240 
the kidney bikinis affected something
that<00:02:41.609> could<00:02:41.970> happen<00:02:42.359> or<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.690> may<00:02:43.560> cause<00:02:43.889> into

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that could happen or that may cause into

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.500 
that could happen or that may cause into
renal<00:02:44.459> failure<00:02:44.519> would<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:45.000> something<00:02:45.239> like<00:02:45.359> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
renal failure would be something like a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.920 
renal failure would be something like a
kidney<00:02:46.410> stone<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:47.010> huge<00:02:47.519> she<00:02:47.609> came<00:02:47.760> down<00:02:48.030> more

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
kidney stone a huge she came down more

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.790 
kidney stone a huge she came down more
importantly<00:02:49.380> kidney<00:02:50.099> stone<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
importantly kidney stone and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.910 
importantly kidney stone and
renal<00:02:52.520> pelvis<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.720> urine<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.560> no<00:02:54.710> longer

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
renal pelvis so that urine is no longer

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.700 
renal pelvis so that urine is no longer
coming<00:02:55.550> into<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.060> ureter<00:02:56.500> remember<00:02:57.500> that

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
coming into the ureter remember that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.870 
coming into the ureter remember that
urine<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.190> come<00:02:58.280> into<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.580> ureter

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
urine is going to come into the ureter

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.670 
urine is going to come into the ureter
is<00:02:59.060> gonna<00:02:59.210> come<00:02:59.360> into<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.600> bladder<00:02:59.870> well

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
is gonna come into the bladder well

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.280 
is gonna come into the bladder well
after<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> urethra<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.970> got<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.390> body<00:03:02.600> but

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
after the urethra and got the body but

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.800 
after the urethra and got the body but
if<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.560> can't<00:03:03.890> do<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.060> urine

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
if it can't do that and urine

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.260 
if it can't do that and urine
accumulates<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.560> here<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.700> urine<00:03:08.090> will

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
accumulates in here and that urine will

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.540 
accumulates in here and that urine will
cause<00:03:08.480> an<00:03:08.630> infection<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.320> kidney<00:03:09.800> another

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
cause an infection to the kidney another

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.000 
cause an infection to the kidney another
thing<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.090> cause<00:03:11.470> into<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> renal

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
thing that it can cause into a renal

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.790 
thing that it can cause into a renal
builder<00:03:13.580> would<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:13.850> something<00:03:14.060> like<00:03:15.160> iodine

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800

CT or iodine injection okay now remember

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.040 
CT or iodine injection okay now remember
this<00:03:43.610> has<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.880> go<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.680> lactic<00:03:45.760> acid

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
this has to go with lactic acid

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.120 
this has to go with lactic acid
production<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:48.800> if<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.040> an

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
production so if you have an

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.070 
production so if you have an
accumulation<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.760> lactic<00:03:49.910> acid<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.930> it's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
accumulation of lactic acid and it's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.120 
accumulation of lactic acid and it's
also<00:03:51.230> going<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.530> affect<00:03:52.100> your<00:03:52.280> pH<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.830> your<00:03:54.830> pH

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
also going to affect your pH and your pH

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.190 
also going to affect your pH and your pH
or<00:03:55.370> decrease<00:03:55.880> causing<00:03:58.690> your<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.930> be<00:04:00.020> more

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
or decrease causing your to be more

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.490 
or decrease causing your to be more
acidotic<00:04:00.680> which<00:04:01.190> would<00:04:01.400> cause<00:04:01.690> intra<00:04:02.690> renal

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
acidotic which would cause intra renal

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.710 
acidotic which would cause intra renal
failure<00:04:03.620> that's<00:04:03.980> inside<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.550> kidney<00:04:04.910> post

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
failure that's inside the kidney post

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.900 
failure that's inside the kidney post
renal<00:04:06.080> failure<00:04:06.230> would<00:04:06.950> be<00:04:07.160> if<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.459> have<00:04:07.640> like

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
renal failure would be if you have like

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.340 
renal failure would be if you have like
a<00:04:08.709> kidney<00:04:09.709> stone<00:04:09.770> here

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.410 

the<00:04:14.350> urine<00:04:14.620> can't<00:04:14.830> come<00:04:15.040> through<00:04:15.069> here<00:04:15.420> and

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
the urine can't come through here and

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.259 
the urine can't come through here and
then<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.980> gets<00:04:18.130> blocked<00:04:18.489> off<00:04:18.730> because<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
then it gets blocked off because of the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.599 
then it gets blocked off because of the
stone<00:04:19.480> causing<00:04:19.930> an<00:04:20.049> occlusion<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.310> here

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
stone causing an occlusion so this here

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.020 
stone causing an occlusion so this here
and<00:04:21.760> backs<00:04:22.480> up<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.200> just<00:04:23.620> like<00:04:23.830> here<00:04:24.250> all<00:04:24.760> this

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
and backs up and just like here all this

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.490 
and backs up and just like here all this
year<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.360> accumulating<00:04:25.900> in<00:04:25.990> here<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.200> causes

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
year and accumulating in here it causes

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.220 
year and accumulating in here it causes
an<00:04:26.620> infection<00:04:27.300> which<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.600> destroy<00:04:29.050> the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
an infection which can destroy the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.510 
an infection which can destroy the
kidney<00:04:30.419> or<00:04:31.419> I<00:04:32.290> told<00:04:32.919> you<00:04:33.040> have<00:04:33.190> male<00:04:33.490> and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
kidney or I told you have male and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.420 
kidney or I told you have male and
versus<00:04:34.060> female<00:04:34.389> and<00:04:34.990> males<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:36.100> older<00:04:36.310> they

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
versus female and males the older they

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.290 
versus female and males the older they
get<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.669> more<00:04:36.880> likely<00:04:37.090> they<00:04:37.480> are<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.690> get

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
get the more likely they are to get

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.300 
get the more likely they are to get
enlargement<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.389> prostate<00:04:40.919> so<00:04:41.919> this

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
enlargement of the prostate so this

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.700 
enlargement of the prostate so this
prostate<00:04:42.760> becomes<00:04:43.090> swollen<00:04:43.930> learnin<00:04:44.470> large

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
prostate becomes swollen learnin large

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.280 
prostate becomes swollen learnin large
then<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.990> urethra<00:04:46.990> becomes<00:04:47.800> clamped<00:04:48.280> off<00:04:49.290> and

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
then the urethra becomes clamped off and

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.430 
then the urethra becomes clamped off and
here<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.040> cannot<00:04:51.340> flow<00:04:51.610> out<00:04:51.850> so<00:04:52.840> again<00:04:53.200> here

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
here and cannot flow out so again here

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.490 
here and cannot flow out so again here
begins<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.950> back<00:04:54.130> up<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.390> backs<00:04:55.780> up<00:04:55.990> all<00:04:56.169> the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
begins to back up and backs up all the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.220 
begins to back up and backs up all the
way<00:04:56.590> into<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.950> kidney<00:04:57.480> causing<00:04:58.480> an<00:04:58.630> infection

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
way into the kidney causing an infection

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.300 
way into the kidney causing an infection
so<00:04:59.470> that<00:04:59.650> would<00:04:59.800> be<00:04:59.880> post<00:05:00.880> Greene
