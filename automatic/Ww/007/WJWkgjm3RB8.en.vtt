00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.700 

next<00:03:11.310> check<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:11.970> feel<00:03:12.300> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.600> lever<00:03:12.810> there

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
next check the feel of the lever there

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.160 
next check the feel of the lever there
should<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> smooth<00:03:14.490> pole<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.450> no<00:03:15.660> binding

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
should be a smooth pole with no binding
