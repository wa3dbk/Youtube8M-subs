00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
like I heard drive to me so I noticed on

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.770 
like I heard drive to me so I noticed on
the<00:03:03.440> playing<00:03:04.440> around<00:03:04.650> with<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> figure<00:03:05.280> that

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
the playing around with the figure that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.930 
the playing around with the figure that
he<00:03:06.780> doesn't<00:03:06.960> quite<00:03:07.230> hold<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.770> well<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.850> his

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
he doesn't quite hold it well in his

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.670 
he doesn't quite hold it well in his
right<00:03:09.180> hand<00:03:09.210> may<00:03:09.600> actually<00:03:09.990> hold<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.470> better

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
right hand may actually hold it better

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.040 
right hand may actually hold it better
in<00:03:10.890> his<00:03:11.040> left<00:03:11.690> so<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.580> pretty<00:03:15.540> loose<00:03:15.810> on

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
in his left so it's a pretty loose on

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.310 
in his left so it's a pretty loose on
his<00:03:16.290> right<00:03:16.530> hand<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:18.080> easily<00:03:19.430> comes<00:03:20.430> out<00:03:21.320> it

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
his right hand and easily comes out it

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.900 
his right hand and easily comes out it
fits<00:03:22.560> well<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:22.980> his<00:03:23.430> holster<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:26.400> put<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
fits well in his holster here and put it

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.380 
fits well in his holster here and put it
in<00:03:27.030> here<00:03:27.240> and<00:03:28.280> actually<00:03:30.050> fits<00:03:31.050> pretty<00:03:31.830> tight

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
in here and actually fits pretty tight

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.230 
in here and actually fits pretty tight
so<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:34.110> think<00:03:34.500> that's<00:03:34.830> pretty<00:03:35.070> neat<00:03:35.340> I've<00:03:35.850> heard

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
so I think that's pretty neat I've heard

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.610 
so I think that's pretty neat I've heard
issues<00:03:36.720> with<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.260> captain<00:03:37.470> cold<00:03:37.980> figure<00:03:39.620> with

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
issues with the captain cold figure with

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.720 
issues with the captain cold figure with
the<00:03:41.240> holster<00:03:42.500> but<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.620> one<00:03:43.800> fits<00:03:43.980> quite<00:03:44.610> well

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
the holster but this one fits quite well

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.040 
the holster but this one fits quite well
so<00:03:46.520> looking<00:03:47.520> at<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> beetle<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.270> figure<00:03:48.990> I

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050

we<00:03:55.950> are<00:03:56.190> very<00:03:56.760> close<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.480> comic<00:03:58.350> rendition

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
we are very close to the comic rendition

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.400 
we are very close to the comic rendition
of<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.130> character<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.910> then<00:04:00.810> if<00:04:01.020> you<00:04:01.170> look<00:04:01.290> at

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
of the character and then if you look at

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.930 
of the character and then if you look at
the<00:04:01.530> eyes<00:04:01.740> on<00:04:02.630> there<00:04:03.630> at<00:04:04.370> its<00:04:05.370> even<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.790> can

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
see the eyes beneath the mask let me get

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.540 
see the eyes beneath the mask let me get
it<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.930> focus<00:04:10.140> here

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.520 

there<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:15.640> go<00:04:15.820> you<00:04:16.360> could<00:04:16.870> see<00:04:17.110> his<00:04:17.260> eyes

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.180 
there you go you could see his eyes
beneath<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.430> mask<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.930> eye<00:04:19.959> mask<00:04:20.410> made<00:04:21.160> of
