then rotate it up and back we've got a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.449 
then rotate it up and back we've got a
range<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.750> motion<00:03:06.400> unbelievable<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.430> can't

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
range of motion unbelievable I can't

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.250 
range of motion unbelievable I can't
really<00:03:07.790> go<00:03:08.030> over<00:03:08.269> my<00:03:08.569> head<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.989> only<00:03:09.110> go

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
really go over my head I can only go

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.800 
really go over my head I can only go
that<00:03:09.470> way<00:03:09.650> kind<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.670> like<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.850> Hitler<00:03:11.239> salute<00:03:11.569> or

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
that way kind of like a Hitler salute or

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.320 
that way kind of like a Hitler salute or
something<00:03:11.890> doesn't<00:03:12.890> look<00:03:12.920> right<00:03:13.330> whatever
