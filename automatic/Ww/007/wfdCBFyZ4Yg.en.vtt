00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.090
 ready and you can see that here you 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.240
 because your reflector can not play for 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.490
 example I also forgot here if 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.570

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.189
 of ipad will show how good it is going to give 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.740
 all the sounds in case you're 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.330
 playing in this would be the sound of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.710
 game 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.390

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.789
 integrated will mark what I'm 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.299
 speaking in quality you can put a 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.929
 high quality or you can put a maximum 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.240
 quality 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.250
 ok obviously depending on how much 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.229
 memory you have available that much 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.000
 You want me to weigh the video so you can 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.380
 put the qualities ok 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.549

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.320
