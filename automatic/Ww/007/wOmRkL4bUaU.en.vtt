00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.839 

storage<00:03:34.500> memory<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.129> then<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.459> need<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.730> go

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
storage memory and then you need to go

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.080 
storage memory and then you need to go
on<00:03:36.150> configure<00:03:36.959> now<00:03:37.140> or<00:03:37.470> customize<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.940> can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
but if you don't I recommend just go

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.759 
but if you don't I recommend just go
ahead<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:42.720> make<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.110> whole<00:03:43.260> thumb<00:03:43.530> drive

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
ahead and make the whole thumb drive

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.289 
ahead and make the whole thumb drive
make<00:03:44.010> sure<00:03:44.159> you<00:03:44.250> don't<00:03:44.400> have<00:03:44.489> no<00:03:44.700> data<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
make sure you don't have no data on the

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.940 
make sure you don't have no data on the
thumb<00:03:45.480> drive<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.019> want<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.769> keep
