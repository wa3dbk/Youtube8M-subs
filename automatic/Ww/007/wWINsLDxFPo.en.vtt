00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.960
 I'm a sheep and I'm still going 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.679
 with our photography course of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.599
 properties 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.660
 I will now speak of a point that is 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.980
 very important for our photography is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 you realize that this 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 room is a very well lit room she 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.550
 there is the side light here that the light 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.769
 light to the external light in the event that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.950
 same light it is entering both by 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.590
 left and right and up 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 she has another wall this room has another 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.070
 glass wall that is also entering 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 neither did I leave the internal lights 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.559
 off 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.340
 You realize the lights are on. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.050
 All external lights are on 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.590
 here is often here has the light 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.620
 lit up there and more the external light 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.660
 which is entering through the glass wall 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.219
 Because I do it for you, you have one. 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.100
 light balance 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.350
 both the internal light with an external light 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.850
 Can you balance this light better? 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.909
 on the camera 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 if this internal light was not on 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.040
 we are probably seeing a 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 much greater contrast at the light 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.820
 is left side and here in the light 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.250
 right side of the stairs and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.970
 such and here in the middle where light does not tap 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.299
 it 's not coming she could be 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 darker room then you light the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.079
 internal lights 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 Can you have a helicopter a balance? 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.920
 bigger 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 Let's go to the other example, that's it. 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.290
 here you have the same room as another 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.450
 angle 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.060
 showing that it is well lit outside 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.860
 and in here you have all the lights 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.280
 lighting is also important. 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.869
 another room in the same house is showing 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.130
 the internal light and the external light 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:08.670
 the kitchen well lit and here we 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.819
 enter now in another detail I already I 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.000
 Searching photos is from brokers of 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.330
 properties 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.360
 furniture I realized that there are many photos 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.550
 that appear reflex of the whole photograph 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.740
 photo that appears the picture river 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.730
 photographer is called self portrait 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.560
 you can not appear a reflection is of 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.750
 that you do not take so much into 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.590
 Mirror as shadow as water in 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.540
 pool 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.330
 all these forces that appear their 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.540
 reflexes you should not put on site 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.980
 no that's right how we end 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.230
 with this reflex 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.320
 You end up with a reflex both finding 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 best angle as putting an object 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.380
 hiding and if there is this picture here 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 You realize there's a mirror here. 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.920
 in the bottom of the side of the barbecue that is 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.950
 I was reflecting my image as it is 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.180
 I did, I put this on and if that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.230
 little plant that I would not know if it was 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.530
 the artificial or natural plant but I 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.510
 I know you hid me, that's right, and then I do not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.860
 appears in the photo you should make the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.500
 same thing 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.290
 You have to find a right angle to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.680
 you do not appear in the reflection 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.130
 this is another example that the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.150
 same is the same decorated this wall 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.610
 here o 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.000
 she is all in the mirror every time she 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.920
 You have this is that amount of 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.660
 mirrors that you have here in this 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.640
 You have here in this set 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.980
 you should use this mirror because 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.310
 because the mirror magnifies the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.530
 environment is every room that has mirror 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.940
 She gets a bigger room, she gets a 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.150
 larger room 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.400
 that's right and you should use this only 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.610
 you should use this as a benefit of 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.600
 you is not to stay is appearing in 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.910
 reflex not 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.180
 So how could I do this? 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.079
 photo is without appearing I found the best 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.320
 angle 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:15.190
 I'm sure of the photograph and I 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.900
 camera I positioned the camera well in the beginning 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.870
 photo which appeared no longer the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.130
 my image is then you eat me 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.750
 I'm fine here, okay? 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.810
 in this corner here just like me 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.950
 I placed the camera in the right cut and 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.530
 does not appear 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.690
 in the reflection and this is what you should do 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.840
 It's okay, let's go to a next example. 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.440
 This one is classic, right? 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.510
 everyone who goes to photograph is washing the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.680
 bathroom that has the mirror always 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.860
 appears there 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.460
 the photographer in the corner of the mirror as 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.410
 Can you get out of the picture? 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.750
 putting the camera at a higher 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.230
 you realize that the camera is in the 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.540
 height of the sink can you see the sink 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.630
 almost to the line of the kite you can see 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.870
 and it's right in front of the photo 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.240
 so where I am here I am here 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.490
 If I were taller, I'd probably 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.670
 would appear here in this reflection but 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.300
 I have a very low camera, and I 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:22.930
 I totally got out of the photo. 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:26.380
 It's okay, I usually say it's a photo. 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.900
 It's to differentiate yourself from a good photo. 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.950
 for a photo breaking twig needs 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.130
 dedication 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.400
 so with this course we want to help 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.320
 you have a new vision of photography 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.050
 to sell real estate better 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.540
 It's okay then, the longer you 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.300
 dedicate to make a photo more 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.690
 time you stay in the property photographing 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.900
 sure it 's this time you are 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:57.010
 Investing is going to get you going 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.990
 having a comeback is I've already said and never 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.930
 I can not speak what I usually do 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.350
 100 to 120 photos per property 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.170
 start making at least 30 40 photos 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.070
 for real estate for sure you will do 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:15.010
 better photos knowing all of these are 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:18.640
 these tips that we gave during this 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:21.490
 So, go ahead and do it right, if 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.960
 you need to purchase reference is 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.960
 home magazines and decoration 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.490
 there are several real estate websites that 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.750
 they are posting good photos as well 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:38.169
 It's okay, so it's research if you dedicate 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.840
 What are you guys going to have a comeback for? 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.930
 Another very important issue is that 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.030
 You must choose the best picture to 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.010
 you upload as the main photo for the 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.020
 website you will say you will 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.760
 publish in the case of real estate 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.530
 You must identify this photo. 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.110
 best photo 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.770
 usually the best photograph which is or 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.900
 facade or is the main room or 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.139
 The photograph you found most beautiful 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.160
 It's alright if you do not select the best one. 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:11.500
 photo to be the main photo of the 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.410
 of the ad what will happen 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.560
 the site will understand that the main photo 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.419
 It's the first picture of all the photos. 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.080
 What are you up for the website? 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.419
 right 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.350
 the first photo of all the photos you have 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:27.070
 you did 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:30.880
 then you should select the best photo and 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:34.030
 put it first is between 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.700
 all other staff is this me 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.940
 I appreciate your attention and even 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.940
 next
