00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
for their labs to test the networks

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.370 
for their labs to test the networks
these<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.190> highly<00:00:35.760> secure<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.140> locked

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
these are highly secure that are locked

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
these are highly secure that are locked
up<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.860> everything<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.910> only<00:00:39.090> people

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
up and everything and the only people

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.069 
up and everything and the only people
that<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:41.460> we'll<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that do see then we'll see that this is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.209 
that do see then we'll see that this is
the<00:00:43.950> iphone<00:00:44.070> 5<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.649> design

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the iphone 5 but it is not in the design

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.110 
the iphone 5 but it is not in the design
so<00:00:48.059> meaning<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> iphone<00:00:50.760> 5<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
so meaning it's not how the iphone 5 is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.319 
so meaning it's not how the iphone 5 is
going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> turn<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.960> could<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> huge

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
going to turn out it could have a huge

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
going to turn out it could have a huge
tissue<00:00:54.329> box<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> end<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
tissue box at the end of it but the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.110 
tissue box at the end of it but the
internals<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.960> iphone<00:00:58.260> 5<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.090> this<00:01:00.090> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
internals are the iphone 5 so this is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
internals are the iphone 5 so this is
basically<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> carriers<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.219> their

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
basically for the carriers in their

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
basically for the carriers in their
research<00:01:02.760> labs<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.570> test<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.350> their

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
research labs to test it out for their

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.219 
research labs to test it out for their
networks<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.270> in<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.540> news<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.939> dates
