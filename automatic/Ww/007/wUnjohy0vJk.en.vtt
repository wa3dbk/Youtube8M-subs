00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
here's why it does everything that you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.440 
here's why it does everything that you
would<00:00:32.160> expect<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.149> does<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
would expect it to do and it does it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.130 
would expect it to do and it does it
pretty<00:00:33.809> well<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.500> um<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.309> terms<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:36.989> it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
pretty well so um in terms of what it's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
pretty well so um in terms of what it's
like<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> regular<00:00:38.010> digital<00:00:38.250> camera<00:00:38.850> you

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
like as a regular digital camera you

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
like as a regular digital camera you
just<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.570> much<00:00:39.690> exactly<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> would

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
just pretty much exactly what you would

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.190 
just pretty much exactly what you would
expect<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.850> 12<00:00:42.059> megapixel<00:00:42.239> camera<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
expect so it's a 12 megapixel camera it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.400 
expect so it's a 12 megapixel camera it
takes<00:00:44.120> entirely<00:00:45.120> average<00:00:45.570> pictures<00:00:45.989> they're

takes entirely average pictures they're
not<00:00:46.590> fantastic<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.399> they're<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:47.820> awful<00:00:48.300> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
flash to be off even if it's a uh it's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.440 
flash to be off even if it's a uh it's
dark<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.460> also<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.850> slow<00:01:45.119> sync

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
dark you know you can also do slow sync

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
dark you know you can also do slow sync
and<00:01:45.659> red<00:01:45.780> eye<00:01:45.810> reduction<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.439> basically<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
and red eye reduction so basically I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100 
and red eye reduction so basically I
just<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.329> wife<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
know we just sort of leave it on

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.450 
know we just sort of leave it on
entirely<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.240> auto<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.799> works<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.369> works

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
entirely on auto and it works it works

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.100 
entirely on auto and it works it works
pretty<00:01:53.759> well<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.479> its<00:01:54.750> got<00:01:54.899> some

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
pretty well it's got its got some

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.600 
pretty well it's got its got some
different<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.619> scene<00:01:55.920> modes<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.369> here

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
different you know scene modes up here

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.649 
different you know scene modes up here
so<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.460> like<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so you can do you know like this like a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.359 
so you can do you know like this like a
snow<00:02:00.990> mode<00:02:01.259> there's<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> fast<00:02:02.070> action

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
snow mode there's like a fast action

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
snow mode there's like a fast action
mode<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> mean<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.899> camera<00:02:04.469> has

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
mode but I mean this this camera has

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.859 
mode but I mean this this camera has
very<00:02:05.009> very<00:02:05.100> few<00:02:05.610> manual<00:02:06.479> controls<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.580> and

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
very very few manual controls right and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.449 
very very few manual controls right and
when<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.020> using<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:11.220> are<00:02:11.340> these

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
when you're using it now there are these

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.750 
when you're using it now there are these
different<00:02:11.819> scene<00:02:12.060> modes<00:02:12.090> and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
different scene modes and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.429 
different scene modes and
CLE<00:02:12.879> I<00:02:13.060> don't<00:02:13.540> even<00:02:13.659> really<00:02:13.900> screw<00:02:14.319> around

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
CLE I don't even really screw around

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.440 
CLE I don't even really screw around
with<00:02:14.650> them<00:02:14.920> like<00:02:15.069> for<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.340> most<00:02:15.519> part<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:16.060> just

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
with them like for the most part I just

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.479 
with them like for the most part I just
put<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.720> camera<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.620> intelligent<00:02:18.280> auto

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
put the camera in this intelligent auto

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.360 
put the camera in this intelligent auto
point<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.629> take<00:02:20.409> a<00:02:20.439> picture<00:02:20.680> right<00:02:21.129> and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
point and take a picture right and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.580 
point and take a picture right and
that's<00:02:21.939> like<00:02:22.390> that's<00:02:22.569> really<00:02:22.959> about<00:02:23.049> it<00:02:23.379> now

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
that's like that's really about it now

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.589 
that's like that's really about it now
how<00:02:24.220> does<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.489> camera<00:02:24.879> work<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.269> terms<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
how does this camera work in terms of

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.970 
how does this camera work in terms of
underwater<00:02:26.110> because<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.590> course<00:02:26.769> that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
underwater because of course that's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.770 
underwater because of course that's
really<00:02:27.489> what<00:02:27.640> makes<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.939> interesting<00:02:28.030> right<00:02:28.569> I

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.420 
that i took underwater I just did these
like<00:03:11.139> you<00:03:11.440> know<00:03:11.530> purely<00:03:11.889> for<00:03:12.099> testing

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
like you know purely for testing

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.640 
like you know purely for testing
purposes<00:03:12.879> right<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.359> there's<00:03:14.109> an<00:03:14.230> image<00:03:14.440> here

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
purposes right so there's an image here

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.330 
purposes right so there's an image here
of<00:03:15.639> underwater<00:03:16.540> with<00:03:17.139> out<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.709> flash<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
of underwater with out the flash and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.280 
of underwater with out the flash and
then<00:03:18.760> with<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.359> flash<00:03:19.629> and<00:03:19.959> then<00:03:20.049> there's<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
then with the flash and then there's a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.199 
then with the flash and then there's a
picture<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.859> my<00:03:21.160> wife's<00:03:21.340> foot<00:03:21.699> actually<00:03:22.120> you

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.680 
can see her tattoo on her foot without
the<00:03:24.940> flash<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:25.810> with<00:03:26.560> flash<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.639> um<00:03:28.000> with

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
the flash and then with flash so um with

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.330 
the flash and then with flash so um with
the<00:03:28.870> flash<00:03:29.139> when<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:29.919> when<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.069> when<00:03:30.190> you

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the flash when you when you when you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.770 
the flash when you when you when you
take<00:03:30.579> off<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.879> fly<00:03:31.060> or<00:03:31.209> when<00:03:31.359> you<00:03:31.419> fire<00:03:31.599> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
take off the fly or when you fire the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.930 
take off the fly or when you fire the
flash<00:03:31.959> rather<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.739> adds<00:03:33.040> sort<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.519> some

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
flash rather it adds sort of some

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.360 
flash rather it adds sort of some
general<00:03:34.299> Phil<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> picture<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.280> can

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
general Phil to the picture and it can

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.339 
general Phil to the picture and it can
definitely<00:03:36.489> help<00:03:36.819> with<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> quality<00:03:37.510> as<00:03:37.870> long

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
definitely help with the quality as long

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.080 
definitely help with the quality as long
as<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.620> water<00:03:38.799> isn't<00:03:39.040> too<00:03:39.310> murky<00:03:39.669> if<00:03:39.849> there's

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
as the water isn't too murky if there's

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.539 
as the water isn't too murky if there's
a<00:03:40.180> lot<00:03:40.329> of<00:03:40.359> stuff<00:03:40.629> floating<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.230> water

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
a lot of stuff floating in the water

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.409 
a lot of stuff floating in the water
which<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.699> course<00:03:42.730> would<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.090> kind<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.359> gross

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
which of course would be kind of gross

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.909 
which of course would be kind of gross
at<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.780> public<00:03:44.079> pool<00:03:44.260> but<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:44.650> you're<00:03:44.769> outside

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
at a public pool but if you're outside

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.009 
at a public pool but if you're outside
you're<00:03:45.760> in<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> ocean<00:03:46.480> or<00:03:46.540> something<00:03:46.900> are<00:03:46.989> you

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
you're in the ocean or something are you

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.750 
you're in the ocean or something are you
shooting<00:03:47.379> at<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.560> lake<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.010> there's<00:03:48.160> any<00:03:48.340> silt

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
shooting at a lake and there's any silt

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.550 
shooting at a lake and there's any silt
or<00:03:48.910> dirt<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.359> water<00:03:49.569> when<00:03:50.109> you<00:03:50.199> find<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
or dirt in the water when you find the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.009 
or dirt in the water when you find the
flash<00:03:50.859> it's<00:03:51.699> going<00:03:51.879> to<00:03:51.910> hit<00:03:52.120> all<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.510> crap<00:03:52.840> in

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
flash it's going to hit all that crap in

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.180 
flash it's going to hit all that crap in
the<00:03:53.079> water<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.560> you're<00:03:53.709> going<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.859> basically

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
the water and you're going to basically

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.770 
the water and you're going to basically
sort<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.879> obscure<00:03:55.299> what<00:03:55.510> you're<00:03:55.629> actually

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
sort of obscure what you're actually

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.720 
sort of obscure what you're actually
trying<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.139> shoot<00:03:56.409> so<00:03:56.829> using<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.220> flash<00:03:57.459> is

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
trying to shoot so using a flash is

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.689 
trying to shoot so using a flash is
really<00:03:58.090> only<00:03:58.269> recommended<00:03:59.049> in<00:03:59.340> fairly<00:04:00.340> clear

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
really only recommended in fairly clear

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.420 
really only recommended in fairly clear
water<00:04:01.150> situations<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:01.959> this<00:04:02.889> is<00:04:03.040> my<00:04:03.159> first

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
water situations now this is my first

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.909 
water situations now this is my first
underwater<00:04:03.699> camera<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.419> am<00:04:04.840> by<00:04:05.019> no<00:04:05.079> means<00:04:05.349> an

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
underwater camera I am by no means an

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.770 
underwater camera I am by no means an
expert<00:04:06.129> on<00:04:06.400> underwater<00:04:06.790> photography<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.569> fact

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
expert on underwater photography in fact

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.439 
expert on underwater photography in fact
I<00:04:07.930> know<00:04:07.989> pretty<00:04:08.379> much<00:04:08.440> Jack<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.280> nothing<00:04:09.699> so

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
I know pretty much Jack and nothing so

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.629 
I know pretty much Jack and nothing so
uh<00:04:10.750> yeah<00:04:11.560> that's<00:04:11.919> all<00:04:12.099> I'll<00:04:12.190> say<00:04:12.340> about<00:04:12.370> that

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
uh yeah that's all I'll say about that

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.909 
uh yeah that's all I'll say about that
now<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:13.510> also<00:04:13.659> it<00:04:13.900> also<00:04:13.989> shoots<00:04:14.319> video<00:04:14.560> right

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
now it also it also shoots video right

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.819 
now it also it also shoots video right
so<00:04:15.159> basically<00:04:15.669> you<00:04:16.060> can<00:04:16.299> you<00:04:17.079> power<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.409> on<00:04:17.530> and

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
so basically you can you power it on and

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.020 
so basically you can you power it on and
actually<00:04:17.919> i<00:04:18.070> should<00:04:18.099> point<00:04:18.340> out<00:04:18.489> that's<00:04:18.669> one

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
actually i should point out that's one

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.490 
actually i should point out that's one
of<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.180> things<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.599> kind<00:04:19.930> of<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.169> hold

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
of the things you kind of have to hold

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.230 
of the things you kind of have to hold
the<00:04:20.620> power<00:04:20.799> button<00:04:20.919> down<00:04:21.370> for<00:04:21.789> like<00:04:21.909> an<00:04:22.030> extra

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the power button down for like an extra

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.810 
the power button down for like an extra
second<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.900> then<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.409> will<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.710> course

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
second and then it will of course

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.640 
second and then it will of course
power<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:25.600> now<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.840> think<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.230> may<00:04:26.380> just<00:04:26.410> be

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
power up now I think that may just be

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.590 
power up now I think that may just be
because<00:04:26.920> it's<00:04:27.250> like<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> rugged<00:04:27.850> camera<00:04:28.240> they

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
because it's like a rugged camera they

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.660 
because it's like a rugged camera they
don't<00:04:28.840> want<00:04:29.050> any<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.410> know<00:04:29.440> quick<00:04:30.340> button

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
don't want any you know quick button

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.250 
don't want any you know quick button
pushes<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.240> will<00:04:31.360> turn<00:04:31.540> on<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.780> power<00:04:31.900> so

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
pushes to it will turn on the power so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.020 
pushes to it will turn on the power so
once<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.770> get<00:04:32.890> used<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.310> totally

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
once you get used to that totally

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.510 
once you get used to that totally
totally<00:04:34.270> normal<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:35.530> can<00:04:35.680> also<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.280> can<00:04:36.400> also

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
totally normal you can also you can also

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.070 
totally normal you can also you can also
shoot<00:04:36.790> video<00:04:37.120> right<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.660> put<00:04:37.900> something

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
shoot video right so just put something

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.500

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
tripod underwater not really too sure

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.990 
tripod underwater not really too sure
but<00:05:50.440> yeah<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.250> that's<00:05:51.430> basically<00:05:51.550> what<00:05:51.970> i

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
but yeah so that's basically what i

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.870 
but yeah so that's basically what i
think<00:05:52.240> about<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.510> TS<00:05:52.810> one<00:05:53.050> now<00:05:53.230> the<00:05:53.470> TS<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:54.220> has

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
think about the TS one now the TS to has

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.730 
think about the TS one now the TS to has
actually<00:05:55.390> been<00:05:55.480> announced<00:05:55.870> by<00:05:55.930> Panasonic<00:05:56.590> and

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
actually been announced by Panasonic and

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.070 
actually been announced by Panasonic and
in<00:05:57.400> a<00:05:57.550> quick<00:05:57.760> look<00:05:58.000> at<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.240> specs<00:05:58.540> i<00:05:58.750> actually

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
in a quick look at the specs i actually

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.660 
in a quick look at the specs i actually
didn't<00:05:59.410> see<00:05:59.650> anything<00:05:59.980> that<00:06:00.310> made<00:06:00.490> me<00:06:00.640> really

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
didn't see anything that made me really

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.090 
didn't see anything that made me really
think<00:06:01.210> that<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.110> TS<00:06:02.410> two<00:06:02.680> had<00:06:02.950> any

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
think that the TS two had any

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.430 
think that the TS two had any
significant<00:06:03.760> advantages<00:06:04.300> over<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.720> TS<00:06:04.990> 1<00:06:05.200> i'm

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
significant advantages over the TS 1 i'm

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.050 
significant advantages over the TS 1 i'm
frankly<00:06:05.860> not<00:06:06.040> a<00:06:06.100> hundred<00:06:06.310> percent<00:06:06.430> sure<00:06:06.730> what

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
frankly not a hundred percent sure what

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.490 
frankly not a hundred percent sure what
the<00:06:07.180> differences<00:06:07.630> are<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.960> may<00:06:08.200> use<00:06:08.470> a

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
the differences are it may use a

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.070 
the differences are it may use a
slightly<00:06:08.860> different<00:06:09.250> sensor<00:06:09.940> but<00:06:10.810> overall

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
slightly different sensor but overall

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.860 
slightly different sensor but overall
the<00:06:11.410> ts1<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.980> TS<00:06:12.250> two<00:06:12.460> are<00:06:12.700> really<00:06:13.540> really

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
the ts1 and the TS two are really really

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.990 
the ts1 and the TS two are really really
similar<00:06:14.200> the<00:06:14.830> TS<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.250> doesn't<00:06:15.550> offer<00:06:15.700> you<00:06:15.940> know

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
similar the TS to doesn't offer you know

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.820 
similar the TS to doesn't offer you know
1080p<00:06:16.660> video<00:06:16.810> or<00:06:17.110> anything<00:06:17.440> that's<00:06:17.530> kind<00:06:17.770> of

1080p video or anything that's kind of

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.370 
1080p video or anything that's kind of
crazy<00:06:18.100> Lee<00:06:18.370> improved<00:06:19.360> over<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:19.630> TS<00:06:19.960> one<00:06:20.170> so

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
crazy Lee improved over the TS one so

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.800 
crazy Lee improved over the TS one so
what<00:06:21.340> do<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.430> think<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.670> the<00:06:21.730> TS<00:06:21.970> one<00:06:22.120> I<00:06:22.300> think<00:06:22.660> if

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
what do I think of the TS one I think if

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.690 
what do I think of the TS one I think if
you're<00:06:23.050> looking<00:06:23.320> for<00:06:23.350> a<00:06:23.620> shockproof<00:06:24.340> you<00:06:24.610> know

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
to the pool to the beach a camera you

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.230 
to the pool to the beach a camera you
know<00:06:29.560> maybe<00:06:29.680> you<00:06:29.770> can<00:06:30.040> give<00:06:30.190> your<00:06:30.280> kids<00:06:30.640> to<00:06:30.880> use

take<00:06:33.669> a<00:06:33.730> beating<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.450> think<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:34.990> TS<00:06:35.260> one<00:06:35.440> is<00:06:35.590> a

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
take a beating I think the TS one is a

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.629 
take a beating I think the TS one is a
really<00:06:36.070> really<00:06:36.370> good<00:06:36.640> choice<00:06:36.880> I<00:06:37.120> bought

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
really really good choice I bought

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.670

in the funky orange color as you can see

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.600 
in the funky orange color as you can see
that<00:06:39.710> it<00:06:39.949> comes<00:06:40.129> in<00:06:40.219> a<00:06:40.310> couple<00:06:40.430> different

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
that it comes in a couple different

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.950 
that it comes in a couple different
colors<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.120> there's<00:06:41.449> couple<00:06:41.689> different

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
colors and there's couple different

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.050

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.469 
last thing and that is that if you want

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:50.980 
last thing and that is that if you want

sure that you have a fast enough card so

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.499 
sure that you have a fast enough card so
i<00:06:54.499> had<00:06:55.009> i<00:06:55.039> think<00:06:55.219> it<00:06:55.520> was<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:55.639> class<00:06:55.969> two<00:06:56.300> or

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
i had i think it was a class two or

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.600 
i had i think it was a class two or
maybe<00:06:56.599> was<00:06:56.930> even<00:06:57.169> a<00:06:57.229> class<00:06:57.469> four<00:06:57.860> but<00:06:58.400> it<00:06:58.490> was

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
maybe was even a class four but it was

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.850 
maybe was even a class four but it was
like<00:06:58.759> a<00:06:58.840> patriot<00:06:59.840> class<00:07:00.080> for<00:07:00.349> some<00:07:00.620> kind<00:07:00.800> of

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
like a patriot class for some kind of

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.670 
like a patriot class for some kind of
not<00:07:01.069> not<00:07:01.310> such<00:07:01.520> a<00:07:01.550> great<00:07:01.789> brand<00:07:02.180> and<00:07:02.680> it

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
not not such a great brand and it

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.260 
not not such a great brand and it
actually<00:07:03.979> kept<00:07:04.310> giving<00:07:04.460> me<00:07:04.580> errors<00:07:04.999> it<00:07:05.120> kept

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
actually kept giving me errors it kept

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.330 
actually kept giving me errors it kept
saying<00:07:05.509> that<00:07:05.659> the<00:07:06.349> card<00:07:06.590> wasn't<00:07:06.830> fast<00:07:07.159> enough

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
saying that the card wasn't fast enough

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.550 
saying that the card wasn't fast enough
to<00:07:07.580> shoot<00:07:07.729> video<00:07:08.090> so<00:07:08.270> i<00:07:08.659> would<00:07:09.050> recommend<00:07:09.469> like

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
to shoot video so i would recommend like

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.279 
to shoot video so i would recommend like
a<00:07:09.590> probably<00:07:10.069> like<00:07:10.189> a<00:07:10.219> class<00:07:10.550> 6<00:07:10.939> card<00:07:11.360> so<00:07:12.259> that

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
a probably like a class 6 card so that

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:13.899 
a probably like a class 6 card so that
you're<00:07:12.590> able<00:07:12.620> to<00:07:12.889> shoot<00:07:13.099> video<00:07:13.279> without<00:07:13.699> any

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:13.909 
you're able to shoot video without any

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.519 
you're able to shoot video without any
problems<00:07:14.360> but<00:07:14.599> yeah<00:07:14.840> other<00:07:14.870> than<00:07:15.110> that<00:07:15.259> one
