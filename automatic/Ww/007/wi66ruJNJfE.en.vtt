00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
recipe representing a spinach soup and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
recipe representing a spinach soup and
there<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.739> call<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.640> French

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
there you have what you call in French

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.119 
there you have what you call in French
in<00:00:45.870> Sudan<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.480> very<00:00:48.480> big<00:00:48.719> part<00:00:49.129> where

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
in Sudan which is a very big part where

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
in Sudan which is a very big part where
you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.579> soup<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> thing<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you can make soup but the thing is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.819 
you can make soup but the thing is
normally<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.710> never<00:00:53.090> represent<00:00:54.090> soup<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.500> art

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
normally you never represent soup in art

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.450 
normally you never represent soup in art
in<00:00:56.370> real<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.690> liquid<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.800> how<00:00:59.399> can

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
in real because it's liquid so how can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.360 
in real because it's liquid so how can
you<00:00:59.760> represent<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> food<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you represent the food and now can you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.899 
you represent the food and now can you
represent<00:01:03.229> liquidity<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.530> sculpture<00:01:05.159> where

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
represent liquidity in sculpture where

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
represent liquidity in sculpture where
you<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you are it so you are you have the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.580 
you are it so you are you have the
element<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> material<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.900> looks

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
element which is the material that looks

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.870 
element which is the material that looks
like<00:01:13.890> liquid<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.600> also<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.159> idea<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
like liquid you have also the idea of a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
like liquid you have also the idea of a
recipe<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> ideal<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:22.310> objects

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
recipe and the ideal so that the objects

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.810 
recipe and the ideal so that the objects
the<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> material<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.750> talking<00:01:25.610> that's<00:01:26.610> why

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the the material is talking that's why

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.240 
the the material is talking that's why
they<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.090> telling<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.750> stories<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:29.220> are

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
they are telling some stories they are

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.719 
they are telling some stories they are
their<00:01:29.520> own<00:01:29.700> stories<00:01:30.290> with<00:01:31.290> owner<00:01:32.150> tenant<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
their own stories with owner tenant and

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990 
their own stories with owner tenant and
inside<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.540> liquids<00:01:37.020> inside<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.490> sculpture

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
inside the liquids inside the sculpture

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.289 
inside the liquids inside the sculpture
you<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.659> real<00:01:40.560> al<00:01:42.770> le<00:01:43.770> le<00:01:44.040> monde<00:01:44.430> things

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you have some real al le le monde things

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719 
you have some real al le le monde things
that<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.079> eat<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> especially<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that you can eat and especially which is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.960 
that you can eat and especially which is
very<00:01:47.909> important<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.110> banana<00:01:49.759> when<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:50.939> listen

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
very important the banana when we listen

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.360 
very important the banana when we listen
it's<00:01:52.720> not<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.380> banana<00:01:54.040> suit<00:01:54.460> but<00:01:55.270> but<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:57.130> has

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
it's not a banana suit but but it has

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.250 
it's not a banana suit but but it has
some<00:01:58.210> banana<00:01:58.570> inside<00:01:59.170> and<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.570> looks<00:02:02.080> really

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
some banana inside and that looks really

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.880 
some banana inside and that looks really
real<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.880> it's<00:02:04.270> kind<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.930> mix<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.530> just

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
real so it's kind of a mix you just

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.760 
real so it's kind of a mix you just
don't<00:02:06.100> know<00:02:06.430> exactly<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.900> have<00:02:07.930> this<00:02:08.260> capture

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
don't know exactly you have this capture

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.520 
don't know exactly you have this capture
but<00:02:08.979> at<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.190> same<00:02:09.399> time<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.840> representing

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
but at the same time it's representing

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.290 
but at the same time it's representing
something<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:12.100> eat<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.640> at<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.850> same<00:02:13.060> time

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
something to eat and at the same time

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.120 
something to eat and at the same time
you<00:02:13.510> have<00:02:13.750> some<00:02:14.140> real<00:02:15.070> bananas<00:02:15.700> inside
