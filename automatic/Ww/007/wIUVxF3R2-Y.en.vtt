00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
their new z68 express chipset what is a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
their new z68 express chipset what is a
z68<00:00:21.779> chipset<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.890> everybody<00:00:23.400> knows<00:00:23.609> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
z68 chipset well everybody knows that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
z68 chipset well everybody knows that
previously<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.510> p67<00:00:25.140> chipset<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> came<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
previously the p67 chipset it came in to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.670 
previously the p67 chipset it came in to
market<00:00:26.730> had<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> few<00:00:27.390> problems<00:00:27.420> got<00:00:28.260> recalled

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
market had a few problems got recalled

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
market had a few problems got recalled
and<00:00:28.980> then<00:00:29.160> came<00:00:29.400> back<00:00:29.670> out<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.449> kind<00:00:30.720> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and then came back out that kind of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.540 
and then came back out that kind of
killed<00:00:31.050> things<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.439> Intel<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.130> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
killed things with Intel for that so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
killed things with Intel for that so
what<00:00:32.700> they've<00:00:32.850> done<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.120> they've<00:00:33.390> gone<00:00:33.570> back

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
what they've done is they've gone back

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.020 
what they've done is they've gone back
to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> drawing<00:00:34.440> board<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.000> reinvented<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to the drawing board and reinvented a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
to the drawing board and reinvented a
new<00:00:36.300> chipset<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.989> incorporates<00:00:37.559> all<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

this<00:02:55.520> thing<00:02:55.760> has<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> code<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.570> only<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:57.020> know

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
this thing has a code that only you know

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.170 
this thing has a code that only you know
that<00:02:57.770> makes<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.460> when<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.790> go<00:02:58.970> there

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
that makes it so that when you go there

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.930 
that makes it so that when you go there
it<00:02:59.390> identifies<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.350> as<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.920> nobody<00:03:01.610> else<00:03:01.760> can

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
it identifies you as you nobody else can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.490 
it identifies you as you nobody else can
use<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.240> so<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.690> say<00:03:02.960> that<00:03:03.110> somebody<00:03:03.260> goes

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
use this so like say that somebody goes

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.960 
use this so like say that somebody goes
to<00:03:03.680> some<00:03:03.860> strange<00:03:04.190> computer<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.760> tries<00:03:04.940> to
