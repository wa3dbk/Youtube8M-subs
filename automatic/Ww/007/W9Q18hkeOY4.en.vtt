00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:04.922
This is what you need to do. Go over
there and pretend you don't care.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:08.008
- David has no chance with her.
- Huh? I'm still right here, Chris.

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.360
Are you trying to communicate
with me telepathically?

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:14.998
- What is this?
- That's my 7th birthday.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:17.534
- Did you see that? Hold on a sec.
- What?

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.070
I just saw something weird.
You guys, you got to see this!

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:23.106
- Right there. Look in the mirror.
- Dude, that can't be!

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:26.243
That's definitely me! We need to
figure out what I'm doing on this tape.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:28.845
You hear that?
It's in my dad old workshop.

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.881
It's like a clicking or something.

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:33.350
- What the hell is that?!
- Here we go. Project Almanac.

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:35.936
- Temporal revocation prototype?
- What does that mean?

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:37.421
It means time travel!

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:39.222
We should try to build it!

00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:41.091
You're crazy.
We can't build a time machine.

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:43.894
Did you see the tape?
I mean, I think we already did build it.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.253
All right,
you guys are ready for this?

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:54.871
- We did it!
- It's yesterday!

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:57.975
Your broke, you're getting bullied,
so let's take this thing out for a spin.

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.325
- You trying to communicate with me...
- ... Telepathically?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.479
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.336
We could go to jail
for cheating on the lottery?

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.118
You guys only have
5 out of 6 numbers.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.755
- We need to go back and do it again!
- I'm a not winning the lottery twice!

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:14.324
It's still over
a million dollars, guys.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.594
Hey, welcome to Maserati,
can I help you?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.884
You see, I was either gonna buy
1 of these or 17 Toyota Corollas.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.720
I'm being polite in high school.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.102
- You idiot!
- And I want to stand up for myself.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.306
- But you were just...
- I'm everywhere, bitch!

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.010
I love time travel!

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.612
Before the world ends,
I have to fall in love.

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:40.417
Watch this! That's me sleeping!

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.276
What? What...

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.789
Oh, my God! What's happening?!

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:49.126
Are you seeing this?

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.662
Whatever we did
had some crazy ripple effects.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.867
There was a plane crash, riots,
disasters, none of this happened before!

00:01:58.334 --> 00:01:59.770
Things are spiraling out of control.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.105
You didn't care at all
that you friends could be hurt?

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.609
Jessie's missing
and no one can find her!

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:07.067
David, it's me!

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.314
- I'm going back to the beginning!
- It could kill you!

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.982
That's the only way
to stop all of this!

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:12.950
Don't shoot!

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:19.156
Happy birthday!
