00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.950
 this story happened ac long time 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.029
 there was a little blue 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.890
 which was 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.699
 full of white light to the edges 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.849
 every day the same miracle happened 'and' the cuckoo 'was filled with light 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.580
 in this cube 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.580
 lived a little elf 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 he gave the twente a bicycle an ice cream a TV 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.500
 a ball to play soccer and many other things all I wanted 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 the bridge 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 the twente was very happy 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.249
 when the cube was again filled with light 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:59.890
 and what gifts 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.300
 the goblin became very nervous and started thinking 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.690
 it's me who does all that 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.860
 so to someone 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 that gives me that light 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.130
 the goblin understood that and started to feel embarrassed because he did not 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 they had nothing to give to the magician 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.700
 the next day 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.429
 when the cube was filled again with light 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.920
 the descent 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.920
 I do not want to be more the elf that only receive the gifts 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 I want to be like the calls 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 to grant others happiness and light 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.370
 the twente looked at the mabhuh and told him great wizard 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 I gave myself nothing more 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 I would like to be like you 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.460
 I would like to only deliver and not receive 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.570
 unfortunately I have nothing to give you the only thing I can 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.890
 do to resemble me here 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 not receiving anything 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.059
 the next day the cuckoo had no light and was totally dark 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.059
 the twente felt empty 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.709
 he also felt that the magician was sad 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.749
 so 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.569
 that of understanding the mind I do to the magician 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.679
 calmed down 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.779
 I would like to be like you 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.489
 and what gifts 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.179
 everything I receive is yours 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:31.329
 that's why I felt embarrassed 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.759
 but now worse than you're sad 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.359
 I can grant you happiness by receiving gifts from you 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.119
 now I understand will remain of gifts makes you happy in this way 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.679
 we can be happy together 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.550
 the magician again began to fill the cube with light 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.389
 this time 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.499
 the goblin 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.499
 did not not receive for himself this time the twente 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.959
 received the light to make the magician happy 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.949
 in all agreed that he received 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.189
 he wanted to deliver armed happiness 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.169
 for example 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.639
 when the elf received a chocolate and ate a piece 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.699
 in my bed if that made happy armed 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:25.269
 when the elf of her that the magician was delighted to give him gifts 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.589
 that day will also give access to the final 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:30.529
 the magician 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.020
 will continue to fill the cube with light 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.169
 more and more every day 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.749
 where he grew up 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.749
 he says he seemed more armed 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.499
 the twente could enjoy more to grant 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:46.229
 more pleasure to the sea 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.519
 for example 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.519
 instead of the bicycle and the doll 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.209
 he received a car and a girlfriend 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.639
 from these times and to this day 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.670
 the blue cube 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.939
 It is always full of light 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.059
 and the goblin and the magician 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.299
 they live in peace and harmony 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.469
 because each one 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.379
 to make the other happy 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.479
 the goblin 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.589
 every time he receives a gift 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:16.519
 he's happy about that 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.259
 grants armed happiness
