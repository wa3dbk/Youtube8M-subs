 hello friends in today's tutorial I'm going 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.840
 to explain how to download a song 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.480
 or video from youtube for free 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.070
 from your mobile phone or tablet 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.550
 with this application 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.860
 I had blanket as always below in the 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.480

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.590
 first thing we should do is install the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.480
 application I had matte and once installed 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.510
 will also install another application 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.820
 which will be the one that will convert us the video 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.370
 downloaded in the format that we choose 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.670
