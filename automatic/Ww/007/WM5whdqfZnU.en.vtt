00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 we talk a lot about the toyota hybrid drive 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.160
 line of the hybrid synergy drive system of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
 toyota but how does this work? 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 system we see it in this neighbor 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 rius plugin service represents the most 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 recent development of the platform 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.230
 technological hybrid synergy drive of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.359
 toyota the system based on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 full hybrid transmission has one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 high capacity ion battery 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 of lithium and a device for the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.600
 external recharge the battery weighs only 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 38 kg more than nickel 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.920
 metal hydride present on the model 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.550
 conventional while the total weight of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 vehicle equal to 1440 kg exceeds only 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.039
 45 kg that of the prius can be 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.050
 recharged through a common socket 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.000
 domestic electricity in just 90 minutes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.510
 without the need for a station 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510
 fast recharge 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.660
 thanks to the compact packaging e 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.430
 smart the battery does not compromise 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.410
 in no way the comfort of the five 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.629
 places guaranteeing a capacity of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.629
 stowage of 443 liters 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.680
 the extraordinary efficiency of the vehicle 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 is further increased by 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.620
 extended electric autonomy guaranteeing 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.200
 consumption of only 2.1 liters per 100 km ed 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.340
 co2 emissions equal to 49 grams per 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.440
 kilometer once the limit is reached 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.160
 electric autonomy the new prius 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.410
 plug in 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.260
 works in traditional hybrid mode 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.140
 reaching consumption levels of 3.7 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.870
 liters per 100 km and CO2 emissions of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.940
 85 grams per kilometer results 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.350
 even better than those 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.350
 of the conventional prius 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.650
 based on the renowned technology 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.780
 hybrid synergy drive 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.880
 the prius plug in and represents a new one 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.160
 reference point for mobility 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.660
 sustainable by offering customers that yes 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.420
 they move in urban contexts 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.140
 the best of both driving modes 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.140
 electric and hybrid
