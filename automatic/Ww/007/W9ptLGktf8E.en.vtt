00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.530
 basic 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 may be that the transfer the files of files between two computers added 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 some 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.829

 the occupation of 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.260
 the dispute counts more discreet threshold 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.300
 if the system disk 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.230
 it surfs in more details 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.580
 and slowly wooden property 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.750

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.889
 like this 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.119
 this program will always be a 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.230
 accessible 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.279
