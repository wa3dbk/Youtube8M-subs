00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.410
 this is the bike aces machine by 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 the strength of the steam 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.630
 so for that we need to 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.630
 steam we will focus in this 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.029
 metal ball so fire alley 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.970
 we live with thirty or so lines 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.040
 of water have heated in the gets 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.690
 a steamer after twenty five bars of 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.370
 pressure 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.610
 the pressure is limited by the valve 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.199
 Security Voted By Sir Papin

 who are breastfeeding a counterweight helps to 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.380
 limit the steam according to the weight 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.140
 what have they had but on these next disputes 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.250
 the distance they have the taste so 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.719
 thanks to this valve 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.290
 we are safely on the steam 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.050
 0.5 bar of steam that allows you to have 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.449
 a lot of pressure for 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.810
 able to take water in this 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.940
 machine there is also a water tank 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.880
 which makes it possible to operate the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.450
 machine on several cycles in this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.759
 Reserve 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 we have about 20 to 30 liters 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.590
 of water that we fill with 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.590
 holes 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.420
 this reserve of water allows to feed 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 the cylinder float this cylinder 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.130
 float is composed of a cylinder 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.190
 hermetic in which we put a 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.010
 wooden float when filling with water 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.650
 he puts it back on it just floats there sow 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.590
 once we're full we close the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 tank valve 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.520
 we open the outlet valve at six 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.850
 meters high we open the steam this 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.640
 vapor removal five bars comes 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.300
 push the float to return the water 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.300
 to the top 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.740
 and this cycle can be reproduced 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.000
 infinitely if one has a supply of water and 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.000
 big enough steam
