weed<00:03:35.669> beds<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.150> seems<00:03:36.389> like<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.780> lot<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
weed beds and it seems like a lot of the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.319 
weed beds and it seems like a lot of the
bigger<00:03:37.680> pike<00:03:38.040> from<00:03:38.250> my<00:03:38.430> experience<00:03:39.000> have<00:03:39.120> come

off<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.660> those<00:03:39.840> types<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.349> spots<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.310> were

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
off of those types of spots if I were

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.069 
off of those types of spots if I were
going<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.699> target<00:03:41.970> bass<00:03:42.269> during<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> scatter

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.379 
going to target bass during the scatter
rap<00:03:43.260> challenge<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:43.980> would<00:03:44.310> pick<00:03:44.699> secondary

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
points a lot of these fish are pre spawn

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.129 
points a lot of these fish are pre spawn
so<00:03:47.579> if<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.879> find<00:03:48.180> one<00:03:48.299> you're<00:03:48.629> gonna<00:03:48.690> find<00:03:48.989> a

lot of them in an area and just keep

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.939 
lot of them in an area and just keep
working<00:03:51.120> those<00:03:51.389> areas<00:03:51.810> go<00:03:52.260> through<00:03:52.500> pods<00:03:52.739> of

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
working those areas go through pods of

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.289 
working those areas go through pods of
fish<00:03:53.099> until<00:03:53.459> they're<00:03:53.579> done<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.790> then<00:03:54.090> just

target walleye just my approach would be

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.530 
target walleye just my approach would be
simple<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.739> would<00:03:59.250> take<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.609> scatter<00:03:59.940> rap<00:04:00.209> shad

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
simple I would take the scatter rap shad

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.559 
simple I would take the scatter rap shad
and<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.290> would<00:04:01.440> cast<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:02.010> on<00:04:02.120> windswept<00:04:03.120> points

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
and I would cast it on windswept points

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.379 
and I would cast it on windswept points
or<00:04:03.720> points<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.829> current<00:04:05.280> passing<00:04:06.000> over<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
or points with current passing over the

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.599 
or points with current passing over the
end<00:04:06.569> of<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.019> concentrate<00:04:07.949> in<00:04:08.069> depths<00:04:08.489> of

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
end of it I concentrate in depths of

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.460 
end of it I concentrate in depths of
three<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.940> six<00:04:09.209> feet<00:04:09.419> of<00:04:09.540> water<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.260> want

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
three to six feet of water and you want

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.239 
three to six feet of water and you want
to<00:04:10.560> know<00:04:10.680> something<00:04:10.980> I'm<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.699> to<00:04:11.790> get<00:04:11.940> bit
