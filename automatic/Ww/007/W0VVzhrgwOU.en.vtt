00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
we've you know we've we had two quarters

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.419 
we've you know we've we had two quarters
of<00:00:49.140> football<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.620> got<00:00:49.800> under<00:00:50.010> their<00:00:50.129> belt

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
of football they got under their belt

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.979 
of football they got under their belt
and<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.030> didn't<00:00:51.510> made<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> big<00:00:51.809> difference
