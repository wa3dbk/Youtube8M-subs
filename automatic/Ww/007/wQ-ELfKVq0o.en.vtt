00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to all so today I had 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.899
 actually want to talk to you about the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 suitcase actually to get to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.200
 the hospital before before doing your 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 operation be it this book or by 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.990
 pass I actually think that it will be pretty much 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.520
 near the same needs 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.930
 so here I tried to rank in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.020
 does the different needs in fact by 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.340
 type so first so different themes 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.259
 that I'm going to address are the brakes in 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.080
 to put in your suitcase the 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.820
 cosmetic in quotes care 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.689
 for hair 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.300
 and then after the practical sides 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.170
 maybe books and decision 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.600
 phone etc 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 and so it's initially in 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.980
 does what is essential to put 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.500
 in his suitcase it's a great pajamas yes 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.879
 you go is in pajamas I think the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.070
 first time right after actually 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.710
 the operation we're going to take off the very 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.760
 sexy blue blouse and we'll tell you 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.320
 will put you in the life that you 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.989
 so hopefully you have that you have 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.379
 normally a box pajamas without practice 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.549
 buttons without elastic which serves strong in 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.850
 any case take the one that is the most 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.720
 comfortable possible in a skeud I 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.220
 also advise you is to take 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.449
 maybe one or two changes because 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.040
 you're going to stay three days actually 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.210
 after the operation at the hospital on average 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.979
 1 maybe it will be more maybe 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.240
 that it will be less I 'm not sure but 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.689
 it's at least three days in the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.000
 protocol 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.260
 so take some extra clothes or 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.630
 you are really comfortable so me 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.950
 I actually had a kind of jogging this 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.869
 not quite a jog it's a 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 pants actually at least as expensive as 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.140
 can say and I had 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240
 I actually had fluid pants on 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.320
 did they have a rubber band 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.670
 very very comfortable that looks 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.200
 still a lot of jogging and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.930
 level of the deo I was rather with 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 tunics like this one does it all 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.799
 here you have you feel not squeezed 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.329
 so what can I advise you 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 this also take socks 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.649
 slippers or slippers if you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 do not have what you will not turn 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.159
 badly in the room as much having the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.119
 feet warm 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.649
 here is for the party in fact clothes 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.350
 high level what I call of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.329
 cosmetics it's a tip it's not 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 of the essential but that's what I 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.420
 I found that they were actually 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.729
 for just after the operation 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.170
 so the next day it's hydrate 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.580
 you will realize that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.780
 you are still quite dry, 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.910
 what I used is the cream 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.489
 cool luxury that is very very 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.319
 moisturizing is really effective in fact 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.269
 so this one I had it actually for 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.560
 from the first day will connect you 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.610
 it's a little your complexion without 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.170
 because I do not wear makeup 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.849
 a lot you see I actually think about 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.459
 the different videos 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.079
 I used a bb cream that fantin 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.780
 Too pasty I do not like BB Cream 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.250
 said therefore misses more cream 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.230
 moisturizing saÃ¯d spleen but also its 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.980
 unifies the skin so that allows you 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.850
 to have one to be a little bit more 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.500
 friendly that completely natural 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.829
 so that's pretty well done for as soon as 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.420
 next day so I had I showed you 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.280
 in fact my makeup kit 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.260
 I do not have why I took I do not have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.420
 used one thing that I could have 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.160
 use the gloss of no I have nothing 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.389
 to use good if you are hyper 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.220
 snap you may be able to use 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.230
 your makeup kit but good 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.239
 it is not essential an indispensable 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.139
 completely indispensable is the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.170
 atomizer 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.470
 the fogger in fact you're going 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.459
 use it before the operation and just 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.590
 just after the operation when you have 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.790
 not yet the right to drink and for the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.350
 before operation it's still good 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.780
 I remind you I went into 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.709
 made to very to 15 hours and I was 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.620
 in the morning actually 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.700
 agen in fact since the night before midnight I 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.290
 can you say that it was ultra 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.329
 indispensable considering the drying 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.920
 I had skin and the desire to 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.810
 to drink in celebration is a little water 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.819
 like that with the promoter on the student 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.139
 it was still not bad and in the 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.030
 second indispensable side 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.080
 stic the lips but because the hour 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.000
 is in tatters 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.950
 it was ultra dry so it was good 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.180
 helped to see a stick that 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.650
 I forgot it's my husband 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.850
 who brought it back to me happily because 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.260
 that it helped me well after that it's 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.700
 rather for the girls had just so 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.920
 you 're going to cream me the cream bb 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.240
 do not forget your eye makeup remover 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.280
 done and so me it's micellar water 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.170
 avesnes that I actually use for 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.330
 cleanse my eyes and my face 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.830
 one of the waters yes that's still good 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.250
 practice you do not feel the rose 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:06.120
 totally and it's still good to 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.430
 to have that with be the same I had 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.930
 earlier taken actually from 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.100
 samples of my perfume actually because 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.660
 that in the day we have it even if it's my 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.580
 sometimes I keep them that when 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.540
 even well done to have them so 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.980
 does not take much space and I had 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.690
 the gear samples my perfume so 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.090
 this is the little black dress of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.170
 war there in the shower actually I'm 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.870
 party was something super 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.190
 simple a drop and an exfoliant because 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.900
 you are happy to raise anyway 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.250
 on your pots you had catheters 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.260
 and all that so it's still good 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.420
 to be able to exfoliate so I had a 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.430
 a washing flower actually for under the 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.900
 shower and a little exfoliator does so 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.640
 the lyon selection of douglas which is 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.810
 just fantastic and creamy you the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.430
 put on you have the impression 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.940
 to be really clean right after in 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.490
 done had then used the exfoliant 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.740
 so of course a glove there me you have 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.250
 saw my hair essential to the brush 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.710
 hair 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.150
 the glove needed I had a flower of 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.040
 wash my gloves and towels for 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.060
 hair and a towel for the body 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.340
 because it's not provided by 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.810
 the hospital and armed hair you see 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.640
 recalls that I had been showered at the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.800
 betadine the day before and in the morning it was 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.900
 cardboard it was horrible I had 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.550
 hair in a sorry state 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.260
 so I redid actually a shampoo 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.150
 normal I did so I did not want to 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.380
 but I had some green wicks I did not 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.910
 do not know what happened I do not know 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.200
 if it's due to betadine but my 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.470
 hair became green on two 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.240
 highlights 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.430
 so I ironed actually one of the young 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.470
 sisters and I learned in may my 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.460
 shampoo usually a detangler actually 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.970
 because they were in a state not 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.760
 possible 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.070
 and after that that's it's my 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.080
 savior in fact so that's the mask of 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.030
 christophe robin a great gift actually 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.689
 I've had that cost the skin of 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.949
 buttocks but actually worth 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.539
 suddenly it's a mask regenerating 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.569
 the rare fig oil of barbarism it is 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.939
 awesome he's frankly feigning the hair 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.529
 are beautiful actually just after that got me 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.999
 do good I normally I them 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.449
 apply once at once every 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.889
 ten days 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.329
 there I do them twice in the week 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.009
 because you really had to recover 

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:53.479
 my hair in normal game but 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.469
 instead of 200 g in fact every time 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.610
 that I wash my hair, that is to say 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.349
 only once or twice a week 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.449
 only jallieu I can not wash them 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.159
 often otherwise it's awful so here we go 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.119
 for the hair when you have mostly 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.099
 if you shower at the 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.939
 betadine before plan full of care 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.919
 because we had to go recover 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.879
 did not want to recover right away 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.499
 see that he is still a little 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.969
 rough some time after so plan 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:17.089
 masks in the practical side 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:19.939
 I used also I actually reported 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.259
 of the press so I do not have 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.389
 necessarily that you see if I also 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.969
 one here but otherwise there were six 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:29.179
 ecology weight watchers super not very 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.499
 coherent and capital it's in the east 

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:33.589
 in the readings that I like 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:34.789
 what you what roofing too because I 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.019
 it was funny to actually watch 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.009
 the recipes while I could nothing 

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:41.689
 to eat at all and then it stays in fact 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.669
 something nice ali had some 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:45.469
 testimonials of what had grown fatter 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.969
 I do not know too much about 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.499
 the operation I did to watch 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:51.669
 still weight watchers but that's it 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:51.669
 everything I wanted to read 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.290
 that's what I can tell you 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.860
 also do not forget your decision 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.170
 phone 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.430
 I had many calls to which I 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.870
 did not answer but I have plenty of 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.250
 texting that they have me because 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.720
 I did not really want to talk 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.900
 spoke to my parents and darling 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.070
 and my children and he my sister and after j 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.360
 did not actually come up to answer suddenly 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.730
 I was very happy to be called 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.740
 but I did not answer necessarily and 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.850
 so it's important to have the 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.230
 chargers because you use it all 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.820

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.340
