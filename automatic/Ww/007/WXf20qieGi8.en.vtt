in<00:03:34.780> contact<00:03:35.049> with<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.620> Korean<00:03:35.980> monster<00:03:36.310> guy

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
in contact with this Korean monster guy

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.830 
in contact with this Korean monster guy
I<00:03:36.459> did<00:03:36.819> send<00:03:37.030> him<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> message<00:03:37.180> saying<00:03:37.690> we'll

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
I did send him a message saying we'll

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.539 
I did send him a message saying we'll
played<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.019> half<00:03:38.200> time<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:38.830> he's<00:03:39.010> gone<00:03:39.250> offline

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
played a half time but he's gone offline

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.300 
played a half time but he's gone offline
so<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> think<00:03:40.750> he's<00:03:40.930> had<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> genuine<00:03:41.620> rage<00:03:41.950> quit
