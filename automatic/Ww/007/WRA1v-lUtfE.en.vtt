00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.039
 hello to all guys welcome to a 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.949
 new video of the second channel 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.199
 today I explain how to download and 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.369
 use the barrels for accuracy i 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:28.730
 serious 1.5.2 bang then I am a lot 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.320
 I want to dose them allow them to create 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.870
 lag in a server 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.030
 then let's first take the link 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 which then leaves description and I will open 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.160
 this page of the mega site that is like 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:47.930
 if they were from america, do you download 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:51.050
 the serious bots and will give you a serious folder 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.970
 bot this exact take it 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.710
 obviously I have to keep winrar e 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.870
 you will find the serious bot box 1.5 then 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.990
 create a folder you want to 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.750
 example there were documents now I have it 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.590
 got hit he created it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.590
 all the data 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.790
 having done that, you can already start throwing the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.970
 server you want 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.250
 then how you have to have to have 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.700
 download a python program that is 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.400
 simple we install and do 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.280
 all when the python balance and you have 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.320
 downloaded this folder open the file 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.050
 serious and the cmd appears you put a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 lippi now I try to throw a 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:53.380
 1t server or between list we give a little ok 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.380
 as always the nice password ok 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.700
 for a more powerful effect I recommend you 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 strongly recommend using more than one says mdr 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.100
 so at least we will fight today 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.100
 let's see some 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.940
 don't need it for any of this here 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.810
 should be fine 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.390
 79 31 then take your ip lo 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.769
 write can not do copy paste ve 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:33.690
 I can write it 101 90.25 1 enter 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:37.750
 seyfried sees 400 then 6 2 en 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.049
 ok let's enter not on server to predict if 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.299
 everything is alright 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.420
 as you see already there are the few there 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.180
 see no I'm entering now you try 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.410
 to open more for example 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.410
 good good good 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.760
 the memory, however, I go to see from 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:09.040
 here 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:24.390
 lippi was 79 31 90 79 point 31.90 where 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:27.370
 you must 251 ok 79.3 21.90 memo 251 79 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.769
 31.90 precisely 25 euros 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:44.350
 select ring always 400 62 then n then 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:47.390
 400 62 n 401 62 energy goes now 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.300
 will arrive in bulk bot 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.270
 in this way you can wear and also 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.860
 the make a server go offline shortly 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.950
 time 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.959
 you see how much nothing really comes into it 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.990
 so many now I don't do him 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.350
 investigated the divide between the password 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.490
 you see coming but so many and this 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.519
 will cause a lot of lag and also could 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.680
 grow the server so if a server 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.290
 particularly seen on the ass vi 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.050
 I recommend using this one 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.790
 method for bastard video guys 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.680
 ends here with the usual colors of 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.410
 download stage because otherwise without 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.610
 nothing works out of that 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.510
 so guys, we talk to the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.510
 next video chat
