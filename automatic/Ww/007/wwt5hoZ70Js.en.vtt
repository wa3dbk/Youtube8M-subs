00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.309
 for sticking polystyrene on the walls 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:13.040
 dry mixes can be used 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:17.220
 like this one that I applied 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.710
 polymine there are other mixes i don't want 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 to advertise 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.130
 nothing I personally took this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.429
 Well, there is a sale of ready-mix glues 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 rather that are much smaller in volume 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.860
 but those glue that they are ready 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 designed for surfaces that 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.960
 aligned that is for sticking 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 polystyrene on a flat surface but 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.940
 this glue 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.590
 it allows you to glue on not prepared 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 surface that is to ordinary 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 brick wall consumption here is pretty 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.859
 big 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 one per square meter somewhere 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.080
 up to four kilograms of solution is obtained 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 in a bag of 25 kilograms i.e. it is somewhere 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:15.330
 6 sheets are designed 6 sheets each 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.430
 sheet and sheet polystyrene their meter per meter 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 that is, a square meter and if solid 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.490
 apply the finished mixture 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.350
 this one this one turns out to be finished 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.579
 mixture 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 almost like cement mortar well 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.840
 plasticizer is added here and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.960
 modifiers 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.579
 which do which make the solution 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.210
 very plastic and which allows 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:51.670
 glue polystyrene so here 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:55.070
 this solution can be applied ready 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.990
 solid it may not be appropriate 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.360
 the entire list, or somewhere like that, I 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.229
 personally apply 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.910
 such around the perimeter around 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:14.840
 solid in the middle here such here 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:19.310
 islets there is hardly any expediency 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.180
 put a solid wall like all 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.540
 equal has bumps and somewhere 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.130
 this one is equal to no simple solution 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.410
 will just hang in the air or not 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:40.720
 pressed to the end like this I put a solution 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.720
 spatula com and now I will prepare it 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.459
 to the sticker how we prepare the surface 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.459
 for pasting 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:03.540
 tile take here such a spatula with 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:06.930
 notches just as well 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.969
 I spend doing it alone 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.849
 quite comfortable but I think you understand the whole 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:16.579
 surface now i will prepare here 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:22.430
 in this way so here is the whole applied 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:25.680
 glue glue composition on polystyrene sheet 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.590
 I will prepare this way now 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.590
 it remains to take the elevator and stick on the wall 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.799
 as you understood to put glue on 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.810
 it is desirable to place the sheet on 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.349
 horizontal solid surface 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.230
 lest it sag not Islam and hang 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.040
 nowhere and then it turns out very comfortable with 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.519
 it work it can do right in 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.510
 rooms if possible and 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.840
 then you put glue on the street and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.879
 stick on the wall is better of course this 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.519
 work together to do then it will be faster 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.359
 one applies adhesive composition 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:13.609
 on foam prepares a second 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:17.090
 the man is already working on the wall 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:19.320
 foam and fix with special 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.919
 plastic nails 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.729
 I have no opportunity to show how I am 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.630
 I stick sheets of foam as I 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.380
 I work one here see i put two 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.789
 sheet 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.630
 polystyrene on the wall from now need 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.770
 fix 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.669
 plastic nails say 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.750
 you can not fix immediately 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.720
 stick a few sheets and then 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.039
 start working already with a drill and 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.039
 plastic nails
