00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:02.780 
all right so this has been sitting on

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.090 
all right so this has been sitting on
the<00:00:02.899> shelf<00:00:02.929> for<00:00:03.169> a<00:00:03.290> little<00:00:03.469> while<00:00:03.590> figured

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
the shelf for a little while figured

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.920 
the shelf for a little while figured
it'd<00:00:04.190> be<00:00:04.340> time<00:00:04.520> to<00:00:04.730> throw<00:00:05.029> it<00:00:05.180> on<00:00:05.299> the<00:00:05.509> Gallants

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
it'd be time to throw it on the Gallants

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.840 
it'd be time to throw it on the Gallants
so<00:00:06.259> I<00:00:06.290> have<00:00:06.500> a<00:00:06.529> new<00:00:06.859> bumper<00:00:07.220> to<00:00:07.339> replace<00:00:07.580> the

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
plain Stockland so there it is this is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.240 
plain Stockland so there it is this is
specifically<00:00:12.800> actually<00:00:13.310> for<00:00:13.520> the<00:00:13.700> Glan<00:00:14.450> one

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
specifically actually for the Glan one

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.630 
specifically actually for the Glan one
so<00:00:16.250> I've<00:00:16.939> seen<00:00:17.240> other<00:00:17.480> people<00:00:17.570> install<00:00:18.109> it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
so I've seen other people install it

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.120 
so I've seen other people install it
should<00:00:19.640> have<00:00:19.789> no<00:00:19.939> issues<00:00:20.089> might<00:00:21.019> be<00:00:21.169> might

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
should have no issues might be might

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.200 
should have no issues might be might
have<00:00:22.249> to<00:00:22.339> play<00:00:22.490> around<00:00:22.609> with<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.820> spacing

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
have to play around with the spacing

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
deco there some ARB decals bumper pull

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.550 
deco there some ARB decals bumper pull
up<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.620> bracket<00:00:37.070> here<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:41.690> lot<00:00:42.530> more

up the bracket here and a lot more

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.040 
up the bracket here and a lot more
hardware<00:00:43.160> than<00:00:43.340> we<00:00:43.460> need<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:43.970> they<00:00:44.840> could

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
hardware than we need so they could

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:55.230 
hardware than we need so they could
choose<00:00:45.230> as<00:00:45.470> we<00:00:45.620> go<00:00:47.380> package<00:00:48.380> here<00:00:53.200> all<00:00:54.200> right

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
choose as we go package here all right

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
all right so for the bumper here we have

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.099 
all right so for the bumper here we have
two<00:01:09.409> screws<00:01:09.649> at<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:09.979> front<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:11.630> removes<00:01:12.020> the

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
two screws at the front that removes the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.130 
two screws at the front that removes the
stock<00:01:12.350> bumper<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:14.210> here's<00:01:14.479> where<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:14.899> might

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
stock bumper and here's where we might

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.660 
stock bumper and here's where we might
have<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.499> add<00:01:15.590> spacers<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:16.340> understand

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
have to add spacers but I understand

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.940 
have to add spacers but I understand
install<00:01:16.939> as<00:01:17.119> is<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.689> shim<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.469> little<00:01:18.859> bit

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
later if needed someone add some thread

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.319 
later if needed someone add some thread

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
I should have looked at the hardware

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.520 
I should have looked at the hardware

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
proper gear a little bit of thread lock

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.090 
proper gear a little bit of thread lock
cuz<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.259> is<00:01:57.439> not<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.009> nylon<00:01:58.459> locking<00:01:58.729> nut

washers in between the Mount and the
bumper<00:02:23.290> or<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.400> chassis<00:02:24.640> should<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.970> say<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
bumper or the chassis should I say to

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.750 
bumper or the chassis should I say to
make<00:02:25.450> sure<00:02:25.660> everything<00:02:25.930> lined<00:02:26.140> up<00:02:26.489> it's<00:02:27.489> nice

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
