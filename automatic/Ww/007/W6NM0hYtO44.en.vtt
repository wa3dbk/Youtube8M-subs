00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
I'm just going to tell you my

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.260 
I'm just going to tell you my
impressions<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> game<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.909> have<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> few

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
impressions of the game I have a few

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.789 
impressions of the game I have a few
issues<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> game<00:01:09.990> 1<00:01:10.439> being<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
issues with the game 1 being the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.710 
issues with the game 1 being the
controls<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> controls<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.689> very

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
controls I think the controls are very

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.950 
controls I think the controls are very
very<00:01:13.200> tight<00:01:13.500> they're<00:01:13.740> very<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.689> but<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
very tight they're very good but at the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.679 
very tight they're very good but at the
same<00:01:16.259> time<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.100> don't<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.240> limited

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
same time I don't like the limited

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.109 
same time I don't like the limited
amount<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.020> controller<00:01:19.439> options<00:01:20.130> for

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
amount of controller options for

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.490 
amount of controller options for
instance<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.630> you're<00:01:21.869> playing<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
instance if you're playing with the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
instance if you're playing with the
wiimote<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> nunchuck<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> gamecube

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
wiimote and nunchuck or the gamecube

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.830 
wiimote and nunchuck or the gamecube
controller<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:26.729> experience<00:01:27.360> I've<00:01:27.540> only

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
controller in my experience I've only

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
controller in my experience I've only
found<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:29.159> jump<00:01:29.759> by<00:01:30.720> pressing

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
found that you can only jump by pressing

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590 
found that you can only jump by pressing
up<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.520> frustrating<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.360> try<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
up now it's really frustrating to try to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.190 
up now it's really frustrating to try to
jump<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> forward<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.829> times<00:01:36.200> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
jump up and forward at times just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
jump up and forward at times just
because<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.189> should<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.400> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
because I think they should have just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.469 
because I think they should have just
mapped<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.150> jump<00:01:39.450> button<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
mapped the jump button to a to a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
mapped the jump button to a to a
controller<00:01:43.020> button<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.189> map

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
controller button you know just just map

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.859 
controller button you know just just map
the<00:01:44.579> jump<00:01:44.790> effective<00:01:45.149> control<00:01:45.420> about<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.750> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the jump effective control about was in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.200 
the jump effective control about was in
fine<00:01:46.110> hopefully<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.220> US<00:01:47.490> release<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:48.060> add

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
fine hopefully the US release will add

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
fine hopefully the US release will add
some<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.659> least<00:01:48.720> classic<00:01:49.500> controller<00:01:49.860> support

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
some at least classic controller support

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.450 
some at least classic controller support
maybe<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.820> don't<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.890> my<00:01:52.890> other<00:01:53.040> complaint

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
maybe I don't know my other complaint

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.160 
maybe I don't know my other complaint
about<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.659> repetitive

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
about the game is it's really repetitive

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.310 
about the game is it's really repetitive
I<00:01:55.820> mean<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.880> thought<00:01:57.210> odin<00:01:57.570> sphere<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I mean I thought odin sphere was a was a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.340 
I mean I thought odin sphere was a was a
wonderful<00:01:58.979> game<00:01:59.180> but<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.899> sort<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
wonderful game but that was sort of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.219 
wonderful game but that was sort of
repetitive<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.070> but<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.119> there's<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.960> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
repetitive to but this there's just so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.069 
repetitive to but this there's just so
