 hello as you know today we are going to do something 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.039
 a little bit different we're not going to go 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.810
 to use flashes or artificial light or 

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:10.640
 no type of production today we are going to 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.680
 see how simple it can be to get 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.600
 good photographs with a space 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.880
 limited time 45 minutes one hour 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.610
 without going anywhere traveling 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.440
 around our from our house and 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.510
 using the street and everything that we 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.580
 offers to get a good take a 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.560
 little bit of street photography and we are going to 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.369
 see how it works on a holiday like 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.369
 today we start 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.529
 Y 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 as photographers the only thing that ever 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.269
 we should carry in our 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 portfolio is an excuse to not leave and 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.290
 photograph while we are at home 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.480
 while we are at any time 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.149
 Without doing anything, life keeps happening there 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.430
 outside in our homes outside of our 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.930
 environment on the streets and offers us a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.640
 lots of possibilities to do 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 photographs that we can add to our 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 The important thing is not whether 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.570
 coming out today we can get a good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.100
 image for the portfolio or not what 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 important is that we know for sure 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.530
 that going out today and tomorrow and day 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.690
 next we can always get something 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 we have hundreds and hundreds of models that 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.009
 are the pedestrians that cost us nothing 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.050
 they are there they just go by as 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.909
 spend our lives we have any corner 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.710
 do not go to exotic places of 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.710
 the four corners around 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.090
 Our house is used to make some 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.310
 photographs that at a given moment 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 They can be fantastic or they always 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 can draw attention to someone and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.429
 only get one shot for 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.409
 our portfolio from a session 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.670
 one hour or half an hour strolling 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.670
 it's worth going out 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.120
 well, you 've seen you cheer up 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.440
 go out on the street today do not have 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.479
 never an excuse for not doing 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.880
 photographs and remember that a portfolio 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.950
 good is a diverse portfolio that is not 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.960
 only learn to handle flash or 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.150
 learn to do at weddings or learn to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.490
 do modeling learn a technique in 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.840
 particular but that your rank be what 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.060
 as wide as possible so that you know 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.800
 defend you in any environment and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.270
 always always take advantage of 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.039
 possibility of having a new piece in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.560
 your portfolio in a session like the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.510
 today you can or can not deserve 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.040
 It's worth it but if we only get 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 an image to add to our 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.019
 portfolio worth going out to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.800
