use to give a little bit more room to
just<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.349> any<00:00:13.559> pattern<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.540> the

of<00:00:50.690> extra<00:00:51.690> width<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:53.250> adding<00:00:53.489> another

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
of extra width to it by adding another

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.510 
of extra width to it by adding another
line<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> front<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.590> order<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
line on the front here in order to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.060 
line on the front here in order to
calculate<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> need<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.890> have

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
to take the total distance that you want
to<00:01:01.289> add<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> way<00:01:02.190> around<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.969> body<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to add all the way around the body and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.710 
to add all the way around the body and
divide<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.559> four<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:06.119> remember<00:01:06.420> if

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
divide that by four because remember if

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.590 
divide that by four because remember if
this<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> dress<00:01:08.040> front<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
this is just the dress front and this is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
this is just the dress front and this is
cut<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> fold<00:01:10.260> whatever<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.040> add<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.820> is

cut on the fold whatever you add here is
going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.450> added<00:01:12.840> twice<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.470> you're<00:01:13.979> going

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
going to be added twice and you're going

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
going to be added twice and you're going
to<00:01:14.159> add<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> same<00:01:15.000> amount<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> back<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.770 
pen so that you can see the difference
between<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.460> line<00:01:47.640> I've<00:01:47.880> drawn<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> line

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
between the line I've drawn and the line

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
between the line I've drawn and the line
that<00:01:48.930> already<00:01:49.259> exists<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> pattern<00:01:50.220> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that already exists on the pattern so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.520 
that already exists on the pattern so
you're<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> add<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.810> line<00:01:52.079> all<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you're going to add that line all the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.350 
you're going to add that line all the
way<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.070> pattern<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.210> tricky<00:01:54.540> part<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
way down the pattern the tricky part is

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
way down the pattern the tricky part is
anywhere<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.810> an<00:01:57.960> intersecting<00:01:58.740> line

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
anywhere you make an intersecting line

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.249 
anywhere you make an intersecting line
you<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.909> make<00:02:00.119> sure<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.780> comes<00:02:00.960> in

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you have to make sure that it comes in

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
you have to make sure that it comes in
exactly<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> right<00:02:03.149> angle<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.750> I'm<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
exactly at a right angle so I'm going to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.950 
exactly at a right angle so I'm going to
use<00:02:04.229> my<00:02:04.409> ruler<00:02:04.469> again<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.579> now<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
use my ruler again and now I'm going to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.529 
use my ruler again and now I'm going to
line<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.649> new<00:02:07.979> line<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.640> new<00:02:09.060> red<00:02:09.300> line

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
line that new line that new red line

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.830 
line that new line that new red line
that<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.750> drew<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.410> lining<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.580> exactly<00:02:12.270> on

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that I drew I'm lining it up exactly on

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.790 
that I drew I'm lining it up exactly on
one<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.200> my<00:02:13.349> crow

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
one of my crow

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
one of my crow
lines<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.720> edge<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
lines here so that this edge of the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.290 
lines here so that this edge of the
ruler<00:02:16.710> is<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.310> perfectly

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
ruler is going to be perfectly

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.810 
ruler is going to be perfectly
perpendicular<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.100> want<00:02:20.310> an<00:02:20.400> exact

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
perpendicular to it you want an exact

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.060 
perpendicular to it you want an exact
right<00:02:21.630> angle<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.350> then<00:02:22.710> you're<00:02:22.860> going<00:02:23.010> to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
right angle and then you're going to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.750 
right angle and then you're going to
connect<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.960> over<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.200> after<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.520> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
connect that over and after you get that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.360 
connect that over and after you get that
right<00:02:27.030> angle<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:28.320> can<00:02:28.530> smooth<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:32.220> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
right angle in you can smooth it but you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.610 
right angle in you can smooth it but you
want<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.670> make<00:02:32.790> sure<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.210> this<00:02:33.540> angle<00:02:34.170> here

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
want to make sure that this angle here

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.010 
want to make sure that this angle here
is<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:36.150> right<00:02:36.330> angle

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
is a right angle

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.590 
is a right angle
I<00:02:37.220> want<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> show<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.520> here<00:02:38.880> what<00:02:39.090> will<00:02:39.210> happen

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
I want to show you here what will happen

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.530 
I want to show you here what will happen
if<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.020> don't<00:02:40.350> come<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.730> your<00:02:41.970> center<00:02:42.330> line

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
if you don't come in to your center line

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.250 
if you don't come in to your center line
at<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> right<00:02:43.470> angle<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.760> come<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.300> say<00:02:46.200> you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
at a right angle if you come in say you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.560 
at a right angle if you come in say you
have<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.130> your<00:02:47.250> neckline<00:02:47.640> coming<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.330> and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
have this is your neckline coming in and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.620 
have this is your neckline coming in and
you<00:02:49.200> come<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.760> here's<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
you come in like that so here's the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.710 
you come in like that so here's the
center<00:02:51.990> line<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.770> dress<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.000> here's<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
center line of your dress and here's the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.390 
center line of your dress and here's the
neckline<00:02:55.110> coming<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.220> that

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
neckline coming in and you can see that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.830 
neckline coming in and you can see that
it's<00:02:56.550> kind<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.820> sloped<00:02:57.060> down<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> little<00:02:57.690> bit

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
it's kind of sloped down a little bit

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.260 
it's kind of sloped down a little bit
when<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.500> cut<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.310> unfold<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.060> it's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
when you cut that and unfold it it's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.720 
when you cut that and unfold it it's
going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.660> look<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:04.490> it's<00:03:05.490> going<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
going to look like this it's going to

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.450 
going to look like this it's going to
come<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> little<00:03:06.570> point<00:03:07.170> there<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:08.280> can

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
come to a little point there you can

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.970 
come to a little point there you can
smooth<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:09.000> out<00:03:09.440> afterwards<00:03:10.440> but<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.800> much

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
smooth that out afterwards but it's much

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.680 
smooth that out afterwards but it's much
easier<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.700> draw<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:11.970> line<00:03:12.090> correctly

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
easier to just draw the line correctly

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.830 
easier to just draw the line correctly
the<00:03:12.810> first<00:03:12.840> time<00:03:13.140> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.030> here's<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
the first time if you do this here's the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.410 
the first time if you do this here's the
neckline<00:03:16.200> coming<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:18.270> it

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
neckline coming in and you just have it

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.690 
neckline coming in and you just have it
coming<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.410> smidge<00:03:19.860> instead<00:03:20.580> of

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
coming up a little smidge instead of

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.060 
coming up a little smidge instead of
coming<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.239> exactly<00:03:21.630> at<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.870> right<00:03:22.020> angle

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
coming in at exactly at a right angle

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.229 
coming in at exactly at a right angle
this<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.130> what<00:03:23.459> it'll<00:03:23.610> look<00:03:23.700> like<00:03:23.850> when<00:03:24.150> you

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
this is what it'll look like when you

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.400 
this is what it'll look like when you
unfold<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:24.989> cut<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:26.840> not<00:03:27.840> exactly<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
unfold it and cut it not exactly the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.650 
unfold it and cut it not exactly the
neckline<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.640> are<00:03:29.760> shooting<00:03:30.150> for<00:03:30.420> if

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
neckline that you are shooting for if

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.350 
neckline that you are shooting for if
you<00:03:31.320> come<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> right<00:03:31.980> way<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.550> have<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
you come in the right way and have it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.150 
you come in the right way and have it
come<00:03:33.540> exactly<00:03:33.780> at<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.440> right<00:03:34.709> angle<00:03:35.130> there

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
come exactly at a right angle there

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.270 
come exactly at a right angle there
which<00:03:35.550> seems<00:03:35.940> very<00:03:36.390> flat<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.650> when<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:37.890> open

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
which seems very flat but when you open

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.630 
which seems very flat but when you open
it<00:03:38.400> up<00:03:38.550> you'll<00:03:39.510> get<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.750> nice<00:03:40.220> smooth<00:03:41.220> curve

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
it up you'll get a nice smooth curve

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.460 
it up you'll get a nice smooth curve
which<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.000> exactly<00:03:42.570> what<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.959> neckline<00:03:43.320> is

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
which is exactly what the neckline is

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.290 
which is exactly what the neckline is
supposed<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.860> do<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.640> same<00:03:44.880> thing<00:03:45.120> will

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
supposed to do the same thing will

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.930 
supposed to do the same thing will
happen<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> centerline

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
of the hem of it same exact kind of
problems<00:03:50.550> you'll<00:03:50.760> get<00:03:51.000> these<00:03:51.209> kinds<00:03:51.750> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
problems you'll get these kinds of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.290 
problems you'll get these kinds of
points<00:03:52.530> dipping<00:03:53.190> up<00:03:53.340> when<00:03:53.580> what<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.850> want<00:03:54.120> is

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
points dipping up when what you want is

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.930 
points dipping up when what you want is
a<00:03:54.330> perfectly<00:03:54.900> smooth<00:03:55.170> line<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.640> you'll<00:03:56.790> do

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
a perfectly smooth line so you'll do

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.790 
a perfectly smooth line so you'll do
this<00:03:57.120> on<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> front<00:03:57.630> line<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.230> center

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
this on the front line of the the center

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.560 
this on the front line of the the center
front<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> dress<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.270> center

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
back of the dress pattern you can do

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.370 
back of the dress pattern you can do
that<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.030> pants<00:04:03.420> patterns<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.080> do<00:04:04.230> that

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
that on pants patterns you can do that

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.990 
that on pants patterns you can do that
on<00:04:04.500> basically<00:04:04.890> any<00:04:05.160> pattern<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.700> has<00:04:05.970> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
on basically any pattern that has a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.630 
on basically any pattern that has a
straight<00:04:06.450> line<00:04:06.770> running<00:04:07.770> down<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.130> center<00:04:08.310> of

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
straight line running down the center of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.780 
straight line running down the center of
it<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:10.110> that's<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.130> add<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.370> little<00:04:11.670> bit

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
it so that's it you can add a little bit

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.810 
it so that's it you can add a little bit
of<00:04:11.880> room<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.180> any<00:04:12.800> garment<00:04:13.800> pattern<00:04:14.220> by
