00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
it's it's buildable but your color will
start<00:02:18.920> changing<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.580> bit<00:02:19.730> because<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.270> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
start changing a bit because of the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.960 
start changing a bit because of the
consistency<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.680> because<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.670> mousse

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
consistency of it because it's a mousse

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.449 
consistency of it because it's a mousse
but<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.599> weird<00:02:23.959> but<00:02:24.830> as<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.430> a

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
but it's like weird but as you can see a

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.130 
but it's like weird but as you can see a
little<00:02:25.760> goes<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> long<00:02:26.150> way<00:02:26.480> especially<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.959> my

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
little goes a long way especially on my

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.280 
little goes a long way especially on my
face<00:02:27.440> um<00:02:27.709> if<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.819> have<00:02:29.060> blemishes<00:02:29.660> perfect

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
face um if you have blemishes perfect

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.559 
face um if you have blemishes perfect
for<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.530> also<00:02:30.739> because<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.760> really<00:02:32.330> really

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
for you also because it really really

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.280 
for you also because it really really
hides<00:02:32.780> them<00:02:32.989> very<00:02:33.230> well<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.769> as<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.400> can<00:02:34.519> see

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
hides them very well so as you can see

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.750 
hides them very well so as you can see
most<00:02:36.290> likely<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:36.799> won't<00:02:37.069> need<00:02:37.310> any<00:02:37.580> like

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
most likely I won't need any like

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.820 
most likely I won't need any like
concealer<00:02:38.269> as<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.959> can<00:02:39.110> see<00:02:39.319> how<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.799> just

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
concealer as you can see how it just

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.910 
concealer as you can see how it just
sits<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.519> top<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.819> your<00:02:41.000> face<00:02:41.209> like<00:02:41.360> that

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
sits on top of your face like that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.699 
sits on top of your face like that
although<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.549> but<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.060> side

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
although you can see it but on this side

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.650 
although you can see it but on this side
so<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.799> really<00:02:46.130> have<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.340> really<00:02:47.209> put<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.540> in

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
so you really have to really put it in

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.940 
so you really have to really put it in
really<00:02:47.840> well<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.290> reason<00:02:48.590> why<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.709> use<00:02:48.769> a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
really well the reason why I use a

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.800 
really well the reason why I use a
concealer<00:02:49.400> brush<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:50.120> because<00:02:50.450> it's<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
concealer brush is because it's the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.559 
concealer brush is because it's the
easier<00:02:51.280> easiest<00:02:52.280> way<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.459> apply<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
easier easiest way to apply and it's the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.990 
easier easiest way to apply and it's the
cheapest<00:02:53.959> form<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.350> brush<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.220> so

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
cheapest form of brush you can get so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.500 
cheapest form of brush you can get so
I'm<00:02:56.299> trying<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.260> be<00:02:57.410> affordable<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.510> working

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
I'm trying to be affordable in working

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.610 
I'm trying to be affordable in working
with<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.750> have<00:03:00.049> but<00:03:00.440> on<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:02.200> guess<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.349> can<00:03:03.500> use

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
with I have but on I guess you can use

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.770 
with I have but on I guess you can use
like<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.799> sponge<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.030> or<00:03:05.180> something<00:03:05.599> but

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
like a sponge on it or something but

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.039 
like a sponge on it or something but
like<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.530> put<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.640> too<00:03:08.299> heavy<00:03:08.600> at<00:03:08.870> one

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
like if you put it on too heavy at one

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.340 
like if you put it on too heavy at one
time<00:03:09.320> you'll<00:03:09.920> get<00:03:10.100> really<00:03:10.340> ghostly<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.350> it's

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
time you'll get really ghostly but it's

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.180 
time you'll get really ghostly but it's
a<00:03:12.500> very<00:03:12.829> matte<00:03:13.190> finish<00:03:13.700> um<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:15.010> don't<00:03:16.010> think

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
a very matte finish um I don't think

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.770 
a very matte finish um I don't think
you're<00:03:16.310> changing<00:03:16.670> my<00:03:16.790> skin<00:03:17.090> color<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.570> much

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
you're changing my skin color that much

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.990 
you're changing my skin color that much
but<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.350> definitely<00:03:18.500> time<00:03:18.859> on<00:03:19.070> makeup<00:03:19.459> so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
but you can definitely time on makeup so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.580 
but you can definitely time on makeup so
most<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.359> how<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.540> wear<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:20.930> when<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.170> go<00:03:21.350> out

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
most is how I wear this when I go out

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.710 
most is how I wear this when I go out
because<00:03:22.100> it's<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.549> like<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.150> me<00:03:23.329> it's<00:03:23.570> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
because it's just like to me it's the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080 
because it's just like to me it's the
same<00:03:23.930> coverage<00:03:24.170> as<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.739> Mac<00:03:25.010> foundation<00:03:25.760> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.599 
I've tried Mac before I just don't like
it<00:03:27.859> because<00:03:28.190> um<00:03:29.260> breaks<00:03:30.260> me<00:03:30.470> out<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.280> I'm<00:03:31.579> just

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609

don't<00:04:20.180> need<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.359> lot<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.720> powder<00:04:20.900> at<00:04:21.199> all

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
don't need a lot of powder at all

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.439 
don't need a lot of powder at all
because<00:04:21.799> it's<00:04:22.070> really<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.550> me<00:04:22.580> full<00:04:22.970> coverage
