4.5 liter v8 engine producing 562 brake
horsepower<00:01:39.049> which<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.320> pretty<00:01:39.560> big<00:01:39.740> jump<00:01:39.920> up

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
horsepower which is a pretty big jump up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.130 
horsepower which is a pretty big jump up
from<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.430> old<00:01:40.549> f430<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.689> produced<00:01:41.990> about

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
from the old f430 that produced about

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.300 
from the old f430 that produced about
490<00:01:42.830> talk<00:01:43.729> is<00:01:43.880> also<00:01:44.149> up<00:01:44.240> now<00:01:44.540> got<00:01:44.979> 392<00:01:45.979> pound

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
490 talk is also up now got 392 pound

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.910 
490 talk is also up now got 392 pound
for<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:47.090> engine<00:01:47.390> like<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.990> California<00:01:48.619> has

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
for this engine like the California has

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.580 
for this engine like the California has
also<00:01:49.070> got<00:01:49.340> direct<00:01:49.729> fuel<00:01:49.940> injection

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.140 

another<00:01:57.590> piece<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.830> Technology<00:01:58.370> four<00:01:58.970> or<00:01:59.030> five

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
another piece of Technology four or five

another piece of Technology four or five
eight<00:01:59.330> shares<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.720> California's<00:02:00.409> gearbox

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
eight shares of California's gearbox

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.510 
eight shares of California's gearbox
this<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> twin-clutch<00:02:03.380> gearbox<00:02:03.520> 7-speed

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
this is a twin-clutch gearbox 7-speed

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.609 
this is a twin-clutch gearbox 7-speed
now<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.510> is<00:02:05.630> crucial<00:02:05.810> because<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
now this is crucial because this is the

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.199 
now this is crucial because this is the
only<00:02:06.800> gearbox<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.400> going<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.610> be<00:02:07.700> available<00:02:07.820> on

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
only gearbox is going to be available on

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.080 
only gearbox is going to be available on
this<00:02:08.630> car<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.470> there's<00:02:09.649> no<00:02:09.800> f1<00:02:10.369> transmission

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
this car so there's no f1 transmission

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.210 
this car so there's no f1 transmission
and<00:02:11.270> there's<00:02:12.020> going<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.170> be<00:02:12.230> no<00:02:12.500> manual<00:02:12.890> option

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and there's going to be no manual option

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.670 
and there's going to be no manual option
so<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> old<00:02:13.730> classic<00:02:14.330> open<00:02:14.900> Ferrari<00:02:15.320> gate

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
so the old classic open Ferrari gate

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.400 
so the old classic open Ferrari gate
click-clack<00:02:16.640> that's<00:02:17.209> gone<00:02:17.510> which<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.230> bit

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
click-clack that's gone which is a bit

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.560 
click-clack that's gone which is a bit
sadder<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:24.910> also<00:02:25.910> need<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> talk<00:02:26.270> about<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
sadder you also need to talk about the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.300 
sadder you also need to talk about the
cabin<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:27.260> it's<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.500> big<00:02:27.800> step<00:02:28.100> up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
cabin here because it's a big step up

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.090

from<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.209> previous<00:02:29.660> generation<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:30.440> really

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
from the previous generation I really

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.320 
from the previous generation I really
like<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> fact<00:02:31.489> that<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:31.730> all<00:02:31.820> contoured

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
like the fact that it's all contoured

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.449 
like the fact that it's all contoured

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
angled towards the driver looks really

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.250 
angled towards the driver looks really
futuristic<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:35.870> also<00:02:36.020> pretty

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
futuristic but it's also pretty

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.050 
futuristic but it's also pretty

here<00:02:42.050> we've<00:02:42.500> got<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.650> system<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.580> tells<00:02:43.820> us

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
here we've got the system that tells us

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.910 
here we've got the system that tells us
the<00:02:44.630> state<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.260> tires<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.890> brakes

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
the state of the tires the brakes

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.620 
the state of the tires the brakes
whether<00:02:46.550> they<00:02:46.700> need<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.910> be<00:02:46.970> warmed<00:02:47.330> up<00:02:47.450> or

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
cool down Ferrari have also gotten a lot

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.160 
cool down Ferrari have also gotten a lot
of<00:02:49.880> controls<00:02:50.239> they've<00:02:50.390> put<00:02:50.570> on<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> wheel<00:02:50.900> we

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
of controls they've put on the wheel we

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.090 
of controls they've put on the wheel we
should've<00:02:51.380> got<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.500> manettino

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
should've got the manettino

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.500 
should've got the manettino
but<00:02:52.519> now<00:02:52.670> we've<00:02:52.820> got<00:02:52.850> no<00:02:53.090> traditional

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
but now we've got no traditional

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
indicator stalks there on the wheel as

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.800 
indicator stalks there on the wheel as
are<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.730> controls<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.300> wiper<00:02:56.540> and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
are the controls for the wiper and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.030 
are the controls for the wiper and
lights<00:02:57.700> sound<00:02:58.700> fishes<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.480> think<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.810> works

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.860 

now<00:03:04.489> all<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.879> engine<00:03:05.239> does<00:03:05.420> share<00:03:05.690> some

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
now all this engine does share some

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.960 
now all this engine does share some

feels much stiffer than the previous one
I<00:03:50.560> think<00:03:50.680> it's<00:03:50.860> about<00:03:51.010> twenty<00:03:51.340> percent

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
I think it's about twenty percent
