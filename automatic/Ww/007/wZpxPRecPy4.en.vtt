00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
try and figure out where I'm at as a

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.649 
try and figure out where I'm at as a
player<00:02:37.400> compared<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.879> everybody<00:02:38.090> else<00:02:38.450> I'm

always trying to achieve to be better

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.819 
always trying to achieve to be better
than<00:02:40.969> average<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.989> that's<00:02:42.139> why<00:02:42.260> my<00:02:42.409> stats<00:02:42.650> are

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
than average so that's why my stats are

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.800 
than average so that's why my stats are
important<00:02:43.219> and<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.819> was<00:02:43.939> saying<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.599> week

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
important and like I was saying the week

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.959 
important and like I was saying the week
one<00:02:45.109> it<00:02:45.469> sets<00:02:46.129> up<00:02:46.310> most<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.579> stats<00:02:46.879> like

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969 
one it sets up most of stats like

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.490 
one it sets up most of stats like
especially<00:02:47.239> Katie<00:02:47.629> are<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.049> whatever<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.409> is

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
at the end of week one is pretty much

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.030 
at the end of week one is pretty much
what<00:02:50.569> its<00:02:50.689> gonna<00:02:50.810> be<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.409> very<00:02:51.829> minimal

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
what its gonna be with very minimal

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.520 
what its gonna be with very minimal
changes<00:02:52.609> unless<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.359> play<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> shit<00:02:54.079> ton<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.500> I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
changes unless you play a shit ton but I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.379 
changes unless you play a shit ton but I
don't<00:02:54.709> play<00:02:54.859> that<00:02:54.889> much<00:02:55.219> yeah<00:02:55.879> once<00:02:56.239> you

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
don't play that much yeah once you

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.319 
don't play that much yeah once you
establish<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.319> baseline<00:02:57.949> statistic<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.090> get

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
establish a baseline statistic and get

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.170 
establish a baseline statistic and get
into<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.129> thousands<00:03:01.129> like<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.699> four<00:03:01.939> digit

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
into the thousands like the four digit

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.750 
into the thousands like the four digit
mark<00:03:02.569> for<00:03:02.959> whatever<00:03:03.500> defines<00:03:03.949> the<00:03:04.189> statistics

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
mark for whatever defines the statistics

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.030 
mark for whatever defines the statistics
it<00:03:04.939> pretty<00:03:05.449> much<00:03:05.569> makes<00:03:06.199> everything<00:03:06.620> else

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
it pretty much makes everything else

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.220 
it pretty much makes everything else
after<00:03:07.699> that<00:03:07.730> point<00:03:08.120> I'd<00:03:08.419> like<00:03:08.719> a<00:03:08.750> drop<00:03:09.049> in<00:03:09.199> the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
after that point I'd like a drop in the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.129 
after that point I'd like a drop in the
bucket<00:03:09.319> yeah<00:03:10.010> exactly<00:03:10.219> so<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.719> is<00:03:11.750> what<00:03:12.109> I

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
bucket yeah exactly so this is what I

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.659 
bucket yeah exactly so this is what I
like<00:03:12.379> to<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.069> is<00:03:13.219> why<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.340> don't<00:03:13.430> have

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
like to do and this is why I don't have

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.610 
like to do and this is why I don't have
previous<00:03:14.000> games<00:03:14.239> when<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.840> get<00:03:15.019> in<00:03:15.169> I'm<00:03:15.379> going

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
previous games when I get in I'm going

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.110 
previous games when I get in I'm going
straight<00:03:15.889> for<00:03:16.099> Team<00:03:16.280> Deathmatch<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
straight for Team Deathmatch and the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.089 
straight for Team Deathmatch and the
reason<00:03:17.419> for<00:03:17.449> that<00:03:17.599> is<00:03:17.870> yes<00:03:18.319> while<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.889> maps

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
reason for that is yes while the maps

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.789 
reason for that is yes while the maps
are<00:03:19.310> smaller<00:03:19.939> than<00:03:20.629> they<00:03:20.840> are<00:03:20.989> saying<00:03:21.290> Russian

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
are smaller than they are saying Russian

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.170 
are smaller than they are saying Russian
especially<00:03:22.250> conquest<00:03:22.759> and<00:03:22.909> probably

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
especially conquest and probably

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.479 
especially conquest and probably
obliteration<00:03:23.680> they<00:03:24.680> at<00:03:24.829> least<00:03:24.979> give<00:03:25.159> you<00:03:25.459> a

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
obliteration they at least give you a

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.240 
obliteration they at least give you a
kind<00:03:26.419> of<00:03:26.540> like<00:03:26.659> crash<00:03:27.079> course<00:03:27.439> idea<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:28.069> how

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
kind of like crash course idea of how

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.710 
kind of like crash course idea of how
the<00:03:28.310> map<00:03:28.639> is<00:03:28.849> going<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.120> work<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.509> what<00:03:29.629> the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
the map is going to work and what the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.839 
the map is going to work and what the
layout<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.379> generally<00:03:31.040> those<00:03:31.220> TDM<00:03:31.609> maps

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
layout is and generally those TDM maps

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.050 
layout is and generally those TDM maps
tend<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.209> be<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.689> well<00:03:33.879> usually<00:03:34.879> in<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
tend to be in the well usually in the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.339 
tend to be in the well usually in the
middle<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.419> map<00:03:35.569> or<00:03:35.810> like<00:03:35.989> kind<00:03:36.199> of<00:03:36.229> in<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
middle of the map or like kind of in the

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.899 
middle of the map or like kind of in the
hot<00:03:36.590> spots<00:03:36.949> of<00:03:37.069> maps<00:03:37.280> like<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.609> think<00:03:37.819> of

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
hot spots of maps like you think of

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.390 
hot spots of maps like you think of
Grand<00:03:38.090> Bazaar<00:03:38.239> on<00:03:38.569> TDM<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.199> it<00:03:39.290> takes<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:39.620> most

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
Grand Bazaar on TDM and it takes up most

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.339 
Grand Bazaar on TDM and it takes up most
like<00:03:40.699> that<00:03:40.879> that<00:03:41.090> back<00:03:41.389> area<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.169> then<00:03:42.319> a

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
like that that back area and then a

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.589 
like that that back area and then a
little<00:03:42.439> bit<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.069> curved<00:03:43.849> corridor<00:03:44.359> and

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
little bit of the curved corridor and

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.149 
little bit of the curved corridor and
that<00:03:45.079> was<00:03:45.169> always<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.409> hot<00:03:45.590> spot<00:03:45.769> even<00:03:45.949> on

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
that was always a hot spot even on

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.789 
that was always a hot spot even on
conquest<00:03:46.819> or<00:03:47.120> rush<00:03:47.419> and<00:03:47.689> then<00:03:48.139> same<00:03:48.379> thing<00:03:48.620> if

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
conquest or rush and then same thing if

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.619 
conquest or rush and then same thing if
you're<00:03:48.919> thinking<00:03:49.310> catch<00:03:49.699> me<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.909> border<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.419> lot

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
you're thinking catch me a border a lot

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.849 
you're thinking catch me a border a lot
of<00:03:50.720> stuff<00:03:50.870> usually<00:03:51.019> happens<00:03:51.500> over<00:03:51.650> by<00:03:51.739> that

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
of stuff usually happens over by that

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.349 
of stuff usually happens over by that
gas<00:03:52.099> station<00:03:52.129> kind<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:52.909> up<00:03:53.000> on<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.209> hill

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
gas station kind of up on the hill

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.080 
gas station kind of up on the hill
especially<00:03:54.169> on<00:03:54.199> rush<00:03:54.500> conquest<00:03:55.040> or<00:03:55.129> so<00:03:55.430> TDM<00:03:55.819> it

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
especially on rush conquest or so TDM it

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.240 
especially on rush conquest or so TDM it
works<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.599> that's<00:03:57.109> going<00:03:57.409> to<00:03:57.469> use<00:03:57.500> because<00:03:57.949> i

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
works and that's going to use because i

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.819 
works and that's going to use because i
want<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.699> get<00:03:59.180> map<00:03:59.569> knowledge<00:03:59.989> as<00:04:00.139> fast<00:04:00.560> as<00:04:00.739> i

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
want to get map knowledge as fast as i

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.219 
want to get map knowledge as fast as i
can<00:04:00.889> I've<00:04:01.699> always<00:04:01.969> found<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.479> whoever<00:04:03.049> has

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
can I've always found that whoever has

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.110 
can I've always found that whoever has
the<00:04:03.409> most<00:04:03.500> nap<00:04:03.829> knowledge<00:04:04.159> or<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.430> faster<00:04:05.030> you

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the most nap knowledge or the faster you

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.759 
the most nap knowledge or the faster you
get<00:04:05.269> really<00:04:05.540> really<00:04:05.719> good<00:04:05.900> map<00:04:06.079> knowledge<00:04:06.409> the

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
get really really good map knowledge the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.649 
get really really good map knowledge the
better<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.219> you<00:04:07.310> do<00:04:07.549> in<00:04:07.699> these<00:04:07.819> games<00:04:08.030> and

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
better that you do in these games and

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.509 
better that you do in these games and
that's<00:04:09.049> actually<00:04:09.469> a<00:04:09.530> good<00:04:09.769> idea<00:04:09.829> going<00:04:10.370> into

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
that's actually a good idea going into

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.949 
that's actually a good idea going into
team<00:04:10.819> deathmatch<00:04:11.239> because<00:04:11.479> the<00:04:11.569> games<00:04:11.780> will

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
team deathmatch because the games will

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.869 
team deathmatch because the games will
be<00:04:12.049> fast<00:04:12.319> it'll<00:04:12.709> be<00:04:12.829> super<00:04:13.039> fast<00:04:13.340> paced<00:04:13.639> so<00:04:13.789> you

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
be fast it'll be super fast paced so you

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.180 
be fast it'll be super fast paced so you
won't<00:04:14.030> be<00:04:14.150> spawning<00:04:15.049> on<00:04:15.289> people<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.769> waiting

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
won't be spawning on people and waiting

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.499 
won't be spawning on people and waiting
for<00:04:16.340> your<00:04:16.400> response<00:04:16.639> and<00:04:17.180> stuff<00:04:17.329> like<00:04:17.449> that

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
for your response and stuff like that

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.629 
for your response and stuff like that
and<00:04:17.900> probably<00:04:18.469> more<00:04:18.889> importantly<00:04:18.949> you're

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
and probably more importantly you're

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.640 
and probably more importantly you're
going<00:04:19.789> to<00:04:19.849> dodge<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:22.930> cluster<00:04:23.930> fuck<00:04:24.199> if<00:04:24.469> you

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
going to dodge the cluster fuck if you

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.370 
going to dodge the cluster fuck if you
will<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:25.099> people<00:04:25.849> you<00:04:26.419> know<00:04:26.570> hopping<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.229> in

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
will of people you know hopping in in

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.620 
will of people you know hopping in in
helicopters<00:04:28.279> and<00:04:28.460> then<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.789> bailing<00:04:29.060> out<00:04:29.360> or

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
helicopters and then just bailing out or

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.269 
helicopters and then just bailing out or
driving<00:04:29.930> tanks<00:04:30.289> out<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.650> bounds<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.159> all

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:31.279 
driving tanks out of bounds and all

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.100 
driving tanks out of bounds and all
kinds<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.610> stuff<00:04:31.669> that's<00:04:32.000> going<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.210> tend<00:04:32.990> to

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
kinds of stuff that's going to tend to

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.290 
kinds of stuff that's going to tend to
happen<00:04:33.400> when<00:04:34.400> people<00:04:34.580> are<00:04:34.789> playing<00:04:35.000> these

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
happen when people are playing these

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.779 
happen when people are playing these
objective<00:04:35.900> modes<00:04:36.169> for<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.590> first<00:04:36.770> time<00:04:37.039> yeah

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
objective modes for the first time yeah

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.969 
objective modes for the first time yeah
and<00:04:38.060> probably<00:04:38.539> in<00:04:38.779> the<00:04:38.870> first<00:04:39.080> like<00:04:39.289> few<00:04:39.800> weeks

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
and probably in the first like few weeks

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.379 
and probably in the first like few weeks
of<00:04:40.099> the<00:04:40.159> game<00:04:40.340> before<00:04:40.520> people<00:04:40.940> really<00:04:41.240> get

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
of the game before people really get

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.969 
of the game before people really get
their<00:04:41.570> heads<00:04:41.779> on<00:04:41.990> straight<00:04:42.260> about<00:04:42.590> where<00:04:42.830> they

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
their heads on straight about where they

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.950 
their heads on straight about where they
should<00:04:43.130> be<00:04:43.219> going<00:04:43.430> with<00:04:43.699> these<00:04:43.909> these<00:04:44.690> power

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
should be going with these these power

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.829 
should be going with these these power
weapons<00:04:45.409> yeah<00:04:46.130> exactly<00:04:46.339> and<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:47.419> other<00:04:47.570> added

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:47.839 
weapons yeah exactly and the other added

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.469 
weapons yeah exactly and the other added
benefit<00:04:48.169> is<00:04:48.199> that<00:04:48.409> team<00:04:49.219> deathmatch<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:50.060> all<00:04:50.419> I

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
benefit is that team deathmatch is all I

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.879 
benefit is that team deathmatch is all I
know<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.719> said<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:50.960> really<00:04:51.169> weird<00:04:51.320> but<00:04:51.409> team

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
know I said that really weird but team

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.279 
know I said that really weird but team
deathmatch<00:04:52.190> is<00:04:52.430> all<00:04:52.729> about<00:04:53.089> m3<00:04:53.719> kills

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
deathmatch is all about m3 kills

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.050 
deathmatch is all about m3 kills
obviously<00:04:54.650> there's<00:04:54.860> no<00:04:55.339> vehicles<00:04:55.789> in<00:04:55.909> there

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
obviously there's no vehicles in there

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.300 
obviously there's no vehicles in there
it's<00:04:56.270> just<00:04:56.449> pure<00:04:56.990> soldier<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.800> soldier<00:04:57.949> and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
it's just pure soldier to soldier and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.339 
it's just pure soldier to soldier and
the<00:04:58.339> good<00:04:59.000> thing<00:04:59.029> about<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.389> is<00:04:59.449> it<00:04:59.870> really

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
the good thing about that is it really

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.620 
the good thing about that is it really
it's<00:05:00.469> kind<00:05:00.589> of<00:05:00.680> like<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.889> fast<00:05:01.370> forward<00:05:01.760> quick

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
it's kind of like a fast forward quick

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.969 
it's kind of like a fast forward quick
crash<00:05:02.810> course<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.349> getting<00:05:03.650> used<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.919> the

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
crash course of getting used to the

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.439 
crash course of getting used to the
weapons<00:05:04.339> as<00:05:04.550> quickly<00:05:04.849> as<00:05:05.000> possible<00:05:05.389> and

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
weapons as quickly as possible and

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.510 
weapons as quickly as possible and
that's<00:05:05.630> what<00:05:05.839> I<00:05:05.870> want<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.080> do<00:05:06.199> that<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.070> finding

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
that's what I want to do that in finding

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.950 
that's what I want to do that in finding
a<00:05:07.580> weapon<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:07.969> like<00:05:08.180> right<00:05:08.449> up<00:05:08.539> front<00:05:08.779> by<00:05:08.930> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
a weapon that like right up front by the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.990 
a weapon that like right up front by the
way<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.440> can<00:05:09.500> kind<00:05:10.339> of<00:05:10.430> ride<00:05:10.699> for<00:05:10.969> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
way that I can kind of ride for the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.969 
way that I can kind of ride for the
first<00:05:11.180> two<00:05:11.389> or<00:05:11.479> three<00:05:11.659> weeks<00:05:11.690> as<00:05:12.260> I<00:05:12.560> get<00:05:12.740> used

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
first two or three weeks as I get used

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.829 
first two or three weeks as I get used
to<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.219> game<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.639> gain<00:05:14.029> my<00:05:14.240> map<00:05:14.449> knowledge

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:14.839 
to the game and gain my map knowledge

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.170 
to the game and gain my map knowledge
and<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.469> can<00:05:15.650> quickly<00:05:16.010> unlock<00:05:16.430> attachments<00:05:17.029> for

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
and I can quickly unlock attachments for

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.180 
and I can quickly unlock attachments for
it<00:05:17.270> too<00:05:17.389> because<00:05:17.570> I<00:05:18.020> cannot<00:05:18.409> shoot<00:05:18.710> anything

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
it too because I cannot shoot anything

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.459 
it too because I cannot shoot anything
with<00:05:20.029> iron<00:05:20.300> sights<00:05:20.419> so<00:05:20.870> getting<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.169> first

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
with iron sights so getting that first

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.769 
with iron sights so getting that first
red<00:05:21.979> dot<00:05:22.190> on<00:05:22.219> holographic<00:05:22.760> is<00:05:23.120> extremely

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779 
red dot on holographic is extremely

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:25.420 
red dot on holographic is extremely
important<00:05:24.139> me<00:05:24.229> and<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.800> get<00:05:24.949> that<00:05:25.099> done<00:05:25.219> a<00:05:25.250> lot

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
important me and I get that done a lot

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.760 
important me and I get that done a lot
quicker<00:05:25.460> in<00:05:25.909> TDM<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.870> that's<00:05:27.380> what<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.589> looked

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
quicker in TDM so that's what I looked

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.100 
quicker in TDM so that's what I looked
the<00:05:27.860> TDM<00:05:28.250> for<00:05:28.460> that's<00:05:28.610> always<00:05:29.029> been<00:05:29.180> my<00:05:29.210> day

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
the TDM for that's always been my day

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.990 
the TDM for that's always been my day
one<00:05:30.349> thing<00:05:30.589> and<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:31.219> is<00:05:31.250> without<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.909> doubt

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
one thing and that is without a doubt

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.459 
one thing and that is without a doubt
going<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:32.599> be<00:05:32.659> the<00:05:32.750> plan<00:05:32.960> again<00:05:33.110> for<00:05:33.320> about<00:05:33.380> a

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 
going to be the plan again for about a

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:35.560 
going to be the plan again for about a
fee<00:05:33.620> for<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:34.039> want<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:34.880> crash<00:05:35.060> course<00:05:35.419> to

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
fee for I want the crash course to

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.420 
fee for I want the crash course to
understand<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.050> maps<00:05:36.710> in<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.070> game<00:05:37.250> as

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
understand the maps in the game as

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.519 
understand the maps in the game as
quickly<00:05:37.639> as<00:05:37.789> possible<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.960> think<00:05:39.110> TDM<00:05:39.409> is

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
quickly as possible and I think TDM is

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.439 
quickly as possible and I think TDM is
the<00:05:39.620> best<00:05:39.770> bet<00:05:39.919> for<00:05:39.949> that<00:05:40.190> well<00:05:40.940> I<00:05:40.969> guess<00:05:41.300> I'll

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
the best bet for that well I guess I'll

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.450 
the best bet for that well I guess I'll
be<00:05:41.539> playing<00:05:41.659> a<00:05:41.810> lot<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.020> TDM<00:05:42.380> then<00:05:42.620> right<00:05:42.979> well

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
be playing a lot of TDM then right well

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.000 
be playing a lot of TDM then right well
then<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:43.969> other<00:05:44.089> plan<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:44.599> is<00:05:44.810> that<00:05:44.839> and<00:05:45.380> what

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
then the other plan is is that and what

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.649 
then the other plan is is that and what
we<00:05:46.130> have<00:05:46.310> done<00:05:46.550> especially<00:05:46.969> bad<00:05:47.300> for<00:05:47.510> three

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
we have done especially bad for three

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.540 
we have done especially bad for three
because<00:05:47.990> these<00:05:48.080> are<00:05:48.289> technically<00:05:49.099> our<00:05:49.279> first

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
because these are technically our first

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.939 
because these are technically our first
foray<00:05:49.880> into<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.389> battlefield<00:05:50.810> series<00:05:50.960> was<00:05:51.289> we

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
foray into the battlefield series was we

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.040 
foray into the battlefield series was we
kind<00:05:52.159> of<00:05:52.219> just<00:05:52.400> did<00:05:52.940> whatever<00:05:53.150> up<00:05:53.449> front<00:05:53.750> with

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
kind of just did whatever up front with

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.510 
kind of just did whatever up front with
TDM<00:05:54.440> and<00:05:54.589> stuff<00:05:54.740> but<00:05:54.889> then<00:05:55.039> we're<00:05:55.159> like<00:05:55.219> okay

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
TDM and stuff but then we're like okay

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.189 
TDM and stuff but then we're like okay
well<00:05:55.699> let's<00:05:55.849> go<00:05:56.000> play<00:05:56.240> conquest<00:05:56.870> because<00:05:57.080> we

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
well let's go play conquest because we

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.839 
well let's go play conquest because we
really<00:05:57.409> haven't<00:05:57.560> played<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:57.979> yet<00:05:58.099> or<00:05:58.400> rush

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
really haven't played it yet or rush

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.490 
really haven't played it yet or rush
specifically<00:05:59.779> well<00:06:00.080> we<00:06:00.199> have<00:06:00.289> played<00:06:00.469> that

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
specifically well we have played that

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.680 
specifically well we have played that
I'm<00:06:00.800> curious<00:06:01.099> let's<00:06:01.310> go<00:06:01.400> into<00:06:01.639> it<00:06:01.760> I<00:06:01.909> can<00:06:02.570> tell

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
game down a little bit like the first I

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.360 
game down a little bit like the first I
know<00:06:05.870> four<00:06:06.259> or<00:06:06.289> five<00:06:06.469> six<00:06:06.740> hours<00:06:07.009> of<00:06:07.039> the<00:06:07.130> day

know four or five six hours of the day

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.899 
know four or five six hours of the day
I'm<00:06:07.849> going<00:06:08.150> straight<00:06:08.389> for<00:06:08.599> diffuse<00:06:08.930> because<00:06:09.349> I

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
I'm going straight for diffuse because I

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.610 
I'm going straight for diffuse because I
loved<00:06:10.909> surgeon<00:06:11.599> destroyed<00:06:11.930> that's<00:06:12.259> what<00:06:12.529> we

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
loved surgeon destroyed that's what we

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
lived on and that's what this channel

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.969 
lived on and that's what this channel
was<00:06:14.210> born<00:06:14.570> on<00:06:14.690> what<00:06:15.289> search<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:15.680> destroy<00:06:15.800> our

buried inside that game mode and I want
to<00:06:23.690> see<00:06:23.779> how<00:06:23.870> it's<00:06:23.990> gonna<00:06:24.050> play<00:06:24.169> out<00:06:24.320> I<00:06:24.710> hope
