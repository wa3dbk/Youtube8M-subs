00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.200
 elena lisovskaya 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.929
 and I am the author of the blog fox taxis last year 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 at least I was not easy but 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.000
 whatever he is i hope that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.460
 we all will have much more next year 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.949
 better, but on the eve of the new year I 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.420
 decided to answer the most frequent questions 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.600
 which you asked me for a year 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.720
 2013 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.849
 probably the most frequent question is how much 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 a person is involved in creating a project 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.649
 fox taxis so by and large 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.520
 no creation no project 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.820
 I really have my companion 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 he is the director he is his cameraman 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.730
 who is currently holding the camera 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.730
 his name is Taras 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 and also there is a dog Pushkin who is at home 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.670
 everything nibbles so always walk with me 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.760
 and this implies the next question 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.120
 why is my dog's name so strange 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.860
 dog name is so because when i 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.690
 quite by accident was a guest in 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.060
 the city of Pushkin and in the suburbs 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.130
 walked past the girl who was selling 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.500
 Wonderful jump lumps so Pushkin 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.750
 formed my life the next question 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.540
 instead of setting it all up 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.210
 no dear friends fox taxis it is not 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.660
 more than that, most of the commercials 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.940
 filmed on a tip from my viewers that is 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.220
 those people who are among you 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.680
 something they have occurred, they wrote me 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.740
 letters and we drove and filmed about it 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.110
 video so that some people can even 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.810
 confirm the reality of what happened 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.680
 a situation why I open faces yes 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.200
 because well first of all i am 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.780
 I'm afraid for my life for my 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.380
 health because some gentlemen 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.080
 very aggressive and secondly i don't have 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.630
 tasks to brand specific people either 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.330
 how their particular organization the matter is 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.560
 that there are so many crooks in the market 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.569
 which is hardly pointing to specific 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.700
 scammers I'll help you with something my 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.619
 task to tell you about situations like 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.650
 it happens and tell them how not to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.830
 get you ask where are I from 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.050
 knowledge and ability to shoot it all so 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.250
 Now I am a journalist by training, I 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.580
 finished mimo 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 but it was a long time ago by profession 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.510
 practically never worked for 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.240
 the exception of the last few years 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.340
 when i work in television as well 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.569
 I write many articles in various 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.640
 car publications 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.910
 it is on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.280
 2000 I sell a car and sell 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.140
 because after graduation when I went 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 work in them earning my 200 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.980
 dollars, I realized that you can not live like that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.870
 Nexia bought Daewoo sold sofas 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.000
 still bought this still sold 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 will turn that is yes I was once 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 dealers helped me a lot 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.890
 parents in the first place and the first money 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.940
 efforts that is me and mom and dad 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.599
 honestly screamed cars sold them now 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.580
 parents are not in the business of new they also 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.010
 they just help me no longer with money 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.799
 why i don't open my name 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.000
 salon well because I do not want because 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.489
 I believe that advertising and this project they 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.920
 incompatible immediately in humans occurs 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.160
 so many questions 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.690
 what yes she has when commercial 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.739
 interest she promotes her 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.780
 Salon no this case is not promoted and 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.450
 Incidentally, also one of the most frequent 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.269
 questions village cars in my cabin 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.829
 good so i'm gonna tell you how to work 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.349
 in the used car market and 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.950
 sell only good cars 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.160
 impossible we do not engage in lawlessness 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.349
 but also like most 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.780
 car dealers we have cars in good 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.370
 condition and cars do not enter why 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.290
 videos come out so rarely 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.349
 Well, probably because we are with Taras 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.700
 we are busy enough but not that 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.260
 we promise but we will try hard to 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.870
 the number of rollers next year was 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.109
 significantly more than those 14 who 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.680
 came out in the year 2013 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:19.180
 actually work on television and 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.900
 work in the showroom takes a lot 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.360
 time and on the block 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.789
 it remains well, we really will not try 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.130
 I want to look like mother Teresa 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.740
 I will make everything free just for the sake of 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.320
 for the sake of everything non-profit 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.030
 well really commercial sense and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.090
 commercial interest in this 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.850
 there is no project and never was mine 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.110
 interest is completely different 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.870
 I got a lot out of this project 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.520
 interesting television offers and 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.210
 That's probably originally 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.670
 and the idea fox taxis 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.250
 and in conclusion I want to tell you that 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.650
 next year, the plot and the fox taxis can 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.220
 will also be seen on abc a 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.890
 a plus 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.050
 and plots on YouTube and plots on cars 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.230
 Plus it will be completely different plots 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.510
 Well, in conclusion I will probably answer 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.430
 most frequently asked and most 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.740
 provocative question and am i married 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.340
 let's it remain a mystery covered 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.520
 darkness 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.530
 sometimes some people notice a ring 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.210
 my finger sometimes do not notice until on 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.390
 really what difference am i 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.000

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.540
