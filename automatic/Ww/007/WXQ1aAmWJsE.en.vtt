00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mean this three-week Head Start will

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.499 
mean this three-week Head Start will
mean<00:01:38.490> there's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.000> least<00:01:39.180> three

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
mean there's going to be at least three

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.800 
mean there's going to be at least three
weeks<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.430> i<00:01:41.430> highly<00:01:42.150> doubt<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
weeks of it and i highly doubt that it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
weeks of it and i highly doubt that it
will<00:01:42.899> take<00:01:43.079> more<00:01:43.350> than<00:01:43.409> three<00:01:43.799> weeks<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.070> get

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
will take more than three weeks to get

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
will take more than three weeks to get
another<00:01:44.490> few<00:01:45.030> weeks<00:01:45.060> done<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.689> yeah<00:01:46.500> i<00:01:46.530> think

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
another few weeks done so yeah i think

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
another few weeks done so yeah i think
i'll<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.130> able<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> keep<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.909> fairly

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
i'll be able to keep up with it fairly

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
i'll be able to keep up with it fairly
well<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> hopefully<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.189> mean<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> lot

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
well and hopefully it will mean a lot

mean I've not seen anyone else do it in
the<00:02:16.520> community<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:16.970> thought<00:02:17.300> it'd<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.110> pretty

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the community I thought it'd be a pretty

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.900 
the community I thought it'd be a pretty
good<00:02:18.410> idea<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.950> since<00:02:19.370> no<00:02:19.490> one<00:02:19.610> else<00:02:19.700> has<00:02:19.760> done

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
good idea and since no one else has done

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.320 
good idea and since no one else has done
it<00:02:20.110> it'd<00:02:21.110> be<00:02:21.350> quite<00:02:21.500> original<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:23.090> course

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
it it'd be quite original to of course

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.480 
it it'd be quite original to of course
it's<00:02:23.510> not<00:02:23.630> my<00:02:23.810> idea<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.740> concept<00:02:25.160> really

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
it's not my idea but the concept really

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.070 
it's not my idea but the concept really
good<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.820> think<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:26.120> would<00:02:26.210> be<00:02:26.240> easy<00:02:26.900> to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
good and I think it would be easy to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320 
good and I think it would be easy to
implement<00:02:27.410> into<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.070> community<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.850> it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
implement into the community and it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.820 
implement into the community and it
would<00:02:29.480> be<00:02:29.660> pretty<00:02:29.900> beneficial<00:02:30.110> for<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> lot<00:02:30.800> of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830
