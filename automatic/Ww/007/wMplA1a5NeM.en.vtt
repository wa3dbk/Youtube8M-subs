in front of them if they're moving ie
chasing<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> drop<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.720> right

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
chasing you so you drop that one right
there<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.009> slow<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> game<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
there that's a slow this game down a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
there that's a slow this game down a
little<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.049> he's<00:01:22.229> still<00:01:22.259> being

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
little and then you see he's still being

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.670 
little and then you see he's still being
pursued<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> he<00:01:24.360> might<00:01:24.509> drop<00:01:24.810> another<00:01:25.229> storm

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
pursued so he might drop another storm

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
pursued so he might drop another storm
and<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.250> should<00:01:26.520> drop<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.210> here

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and you should drop it right around here

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
and you should drop it right around here
so<00:01:27.659> there<00:01:27.810> another<00:01:28.470> storm<00:01:28.799> goes<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so there another storm goes all the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
so there another storm goes all the
troops<00:01:29.610> walk<00:01:29.820> through<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.020> can

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
troops walk through it and then you can

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.690 
troops walk through it and then you can
see<00:01:31.290> he's<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.590> taking<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.369> troops

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
see he's just taking out those troops

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
see he's just taking out those troops
and<00:01:32.909> he's<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> pursue<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
and he's not going to pursue with the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.319 
and he's not going to pursue with the
forest<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> anymore<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
forest like that anymore so that's a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.170 
forest like that anymore so that's a
great<00:01:36.810> time<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> use<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.799> storm<00:01:38.280> again<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
great time to use the storm again and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.960 
great time to use the storm again and
then<00:01:39.840> let's<00:01:40.350> go<00:01:40.650> fast-forward<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:41.490> more

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
then let's go fast-forward a little more

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.429 
then let's go fast-forward a little more
to<00:01:42.750> an<00:01:43.049> even<00:01:43.380> later<00:01:43.890> battle<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> game<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
to an even later battle in the game and

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.420 
to an even later battle in the game and
we'll<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.740> happens<00:01:46.860> right<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.280> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
we'll see what happens right here this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.149 
we'll see what happens right here this
you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> huge<00:01:49.200> battle<00:01:49.829> that's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you can see this is a huge battle that's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
you can see this is a huge battle that's
ready<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> happen<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:52.049> when

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
ready to happen so this is really when

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.830 
ready to happen so this is really when
storm<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> most<00:01:53.220> effective<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
storm is the most effective for you and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.960 
storm is the most effective for you and
let's<00:01:55.500> let's<00:01:55.979> watch<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.610> happens<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:58.049> now

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
let's let's watch what happens right now

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.520 
let's let's watch what happens right now
so<00:01:59.970> rad<00:02:00.180> ice<00:02:00.300> is<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> push<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.020> over<00:02:01.260> here

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
so rad ice is going to push in over here

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
so rad ice is going to push in over here
on<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.070> Protoss<00:02:02.850> player<00:02:03.030> try<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.330> apply<00:02:03.630> some

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
on this Protoss player try to apply some

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.740 
on this Protoss player try to apply some
pressure<00:02:04.230> and<00:02:04.910> then<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.660> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
pressure and then you can see the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
pressure and then you can see the
Protoss<00:02:07.050> player<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:07.980> important<00:02:08.460> too

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
Protoss player this is important too

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
Protoss player this is important too
because<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.509> playing<00:02:09.660> terran<00:02:10.050> he's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
because if you're playing terran he's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.230 
because if you're playing terran he's
going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.710> have<00:02:10.860> EMPs<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.820> he<00:02:12.060> might

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
going to have EMPs for you he might

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.060 
going to have EMPs for you he might
snipe<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.110> could<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> lot<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.830> things

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
snipe you you could do a lot of things

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.040 
snipe you you could do a lot of things
so<00:02:14.790> he's<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.240> spread<00:02:15.570> his<00:02:15.660> army<00:02:15.960> out

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so he's going to spread his army out

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.290 
so he's going to spread his army out
he's<00:02:16.260> got<00:02:16.440> his<00:02:16.560> Templar<00:02:16.980> over<00:02:17.250> here<00:02:17.550> he's<00:02:18.090> got

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
he's got his Templar over here he's got

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.150 
he's got his Templar over here he's got
some<00:02:18.330> Templar<00:02:18.750> over<00:02:18.960> here<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.440> he's<00:02:19.920> got<00:02:20.130> one

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
some Templar over here and he's got one

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.030 
some Templar over here and he's got one
here<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.820> he's<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.570> try<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.840> suck<00:02:22.560> those

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
here so he's going to try and suck those

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190 
here so he's going to try and suck those
EMPs<00:02:23.760> out<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.660> you're<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> Protoss

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
EMPs out of you so if you're a Protoss

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.500 
EMPs out of you so if you're a Protoss
player<00:02:25.380> make<00:02:25.620> sure<00:02:25.800> not<00:02:26.460> all<00:02:26.490> your<00:02:26.880> Templar<00:02:27.210> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
player make sure not all your Templar on

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.480 
player make sure not all your Templar on
one<00:02:27.720> group<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.980> are<00:02:29.130> for<00:02:29.340> some

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
one group and if they are for some

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.770 
one group and if they are for some
reason<00:02:29.790> try<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.090> make<00:02:30.180> sure<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.450> groups<00:02:30.660> in

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
reason try and make sure that groups in

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.960 
reason try and make sure that groups in
the<00:02:30.840> back<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.830> you're<00:02:32.070> not<00:02:32.160> going<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.490> get<00:02:32.610> all

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the back so you're not going to get all

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.510 
the back so you're not going to get all
your<00:02:33.000> energies<00:02:33.600> out<00:02:33.780> by<00:02:33.990> those<00:02:34.170> ATP<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
your energies out by those ATP so you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.370 
your energies out by those ATP so you
see<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.700> EMP<00:02:36.060> went<00:02:36.300> down<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.600> basically

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
see that EMP went down there basically

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.170 
see that EMP went down there basically
took<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.980> Templar<00:02:38.459> out<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.760> doing<00:02:39.000> anything

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
took that Templar out of doing anything

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
took that Templar out of doing anything
but<00:02:39.480> he<00:02:39.690> has<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:39.959> Templar<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> he<00:02:41.430> has<00:02:41.520> some

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
but he has these Templar and he has some

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.970 
but he has these Templar and he has some
type<00:02:41.820> out<00:02:41.910> over<00:02:42.120> here<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.720> still<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.200> she

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
type out over here in here still so she

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
type out over here in here still so she
was<00:02:44.100> continued<00:02:44.520> okay<00:02:45.000> got<00:02:45.570> he<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.870> Pete<00:02:45.990> over

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
was continued okay got he and Pete over

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.770 
was continued okay got he and Pete over
here<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.620> he's<00:02:47.370> got<00:02:47.580> Templar<00:02:48.209> over<00:02:48.450> here

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
here but he's got Templar over here

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.980 
here but he's got Templar over here
still<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.680> he's<00:02:49.920> still<00:02:50.190> got<00:02:50.850> some<00:02:51.209> opportunity

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
still so he's still got some opportunity

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.640 
still so he's still got some opportunity
to<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:53.250> apply<00:02:53.700> those<00:02:53.970> those<00:02:54.720> storms<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.590> you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
to to apply those those storms so you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.890 
to to apply those those storms so you
see<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.160> energy<00:02:56.580> still<00:02:56.790> here<00:02:57.030> he's<00:02:57.630> going<00:02:57.810> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
see some energy still here he's going to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.350 
see some energy still here he's going to
storm<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.500> groups<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.700> these<00:02:59.910> storms<00:03:00.270> are

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
storm the groups so these storms are

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.180 
storm the groups so these storms are
going<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.570> walk<00:03:00.720> away<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.860> he's<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.130> to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
going to walk away and so he's going to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.820 
going to walk away and so he's going to
want<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.730> continue<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.570> push<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.350> he<00:03:04.500> thinks<00:03:04.739> he

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
want to continue to push if he thinks he

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.530 
want to continue to push if he thinks he
has<00:03:04.920> an<00:03:05.040> advantage<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:05.550> watch<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.120> your

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
has an advantage but watch out for your

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
has an advantage but watch out for your
zealots<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.560> you're<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.800> move<00:03:07.980> him

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
zealots if you're going to move him

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.620 
zealots if you're going to move him
through<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> storm<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.239> will<00:03:09.450> damage

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
through the storm because it will damage

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.009 
through the storm because it will damage
YouTube<00:03:10.280> he's<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.489> keep<00:03:12.180> storming<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
YouTube he's going to keep storming to

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.140 
YouTube he's going to keep storming to
keep<00:03:13.260> pushing<00:03:13.739> him<00:03:13.950> back<00:03:14.160> that's<00:03:14.640> really

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
keep pushing him back that's really

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.509 
keep pushing him back that's really
really<00:03:15.660> effective<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.890> he<00:03:17.040> comes<00:03:17.280> back

that<00:03:20.220> line<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.790> much<00:03:21.000> as<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.239> can<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.690> really

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that line as much as you can and really

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
that line as much as you can and really
just<00:03:22.530> watch<00:03:23.130> these<00:03:23.370> units<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.150> go

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
just watch these units you know all go

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.610 
just watch these units you know all go
down<00:03:24.540> they're<00:03:24.780> not<00:03:24.810> gonna<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.230> able<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.470> lift

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
down they're not gonna be able to lift

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.580

those

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
those

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.820 
those
pop<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:28.060> its<00:03:28.239> area<00:03:28.540> effect<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.590> can<00:03:29.709> see

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
pop and its area effect so you can see

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.839 
pop and its area effect so you can see
even<00:03:30.010> though<00:03:30.160> he<00:03:30.250> had<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> slightly<00:03:30.670> smaller
