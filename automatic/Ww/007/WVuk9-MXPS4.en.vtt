00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
career of Sugar Shane Mosley I think

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.590

there<00:06:56.129> have<00:06:56.279> to<00:06:56.430> be<00:06:56.490> some

there have to be some

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.330 
there have to be some
the<00:06:57.720> fans<00:06:58.230> but<00:06:58.440> I<00:06:58.530> would<00:06:58.710> think<00:06:58.860> that<00:06:58.980> the<00:06:59.130> fans

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
the fans but I would think that the fans

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.890 
the fans but I would think that the fans
would<00:06:59.490> think<00:06:59.730> that<00:06:59.820> that<00:06:59.970> was<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.330> greatest

would think that that was the greatest

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.570 
would think that that was the greatest
win<00:07:01.170> and<00:07:01.410> it<00:07:01.620> probably<00:07:01.860> is<00:07:02.070> the<00:07:02.160> grades<00:07:02.340> when

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580

win and it probably is the grades when
you're<00:07:03.540> big<00:07:03.720> into<00:07:03.870> the<00:07:04.020> social<00:07:04.380> networking<00:07:04.830> so
