00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
what do you see when you look at the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.639 
what do you see when you look at the
night<00:00:05.430> sky<00:00:06.140> depending<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.230> where<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.500> live

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
night sky depending on where you live

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.340 
night sky depending on where you live
you<00:00:08.040> see<00:00:08.280> mostly<00:00:08.610> stars<00:00:09.000> if<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:09.959> look<00:00:10.139> at<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
you see mostly stars if you look at the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.650 
you see mostly stars if you look at the
sky<00:00:10.620> without<00:00:10.770> a<00:00:11.010> telescope<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:12.240> see<00:00:12.449> white

sky without a telescope you see white

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.080 
sky without a telescope you see white
stars<00:00:13.020> maybe<00:00:13.680> some<00:00:13.949> faintly<00:00:14.250> blue<00:00:14.549> or<00:00:14.850> even

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
stars maybe some faintly blue or even

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.900 
stars maybe some faintly blue or even
sometimes<00:00:15.660> some<00:00:15.900> yellow<00:00:16.139> or<00:00:16.379> orange<00:00:16.410> ones<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
sometimes some yellow or orange ones the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.279 
sometimes some yellow or orange ones the
color<00:00:18.180> depends<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> Stars<00:00:19.050> surface

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
color depends on the Stars surface

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.130 
color depends on the Stars surface
temperature<00:00:19.919> for<00:00:20.820> example<00:00:21.269> our<00:00:21.480> Sun<00:00:21.869> surface

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
temperature for example our Sun surface

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.159 
temperature for example our Sun surface
temperature<00:00:22.679> is<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:23.009> 6,000<00:00:23.789> Kelvin

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
temperature is about 6,000 Kelvin

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.689 
temperature is about 6,000 Kelvin
although<00:00:25.169> it<00:00:25.259> looks<00:00:25.410> yellow<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:25.890> Earth<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
although it looks yellow from Earth the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
although it looks yellow from Earth the
light<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> Sun<00:00:27.359> would<00:00:27.539> actually<00:00:28.079> look

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
light of the Sun would actually look

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.950 
light of the Sun would actually look
very<00:00:28.320> white<00:00:28.829> if<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.189> were<00:00:29.339> in<00:00:29.460> space<00:00:29.960> this

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
very white if we were in space this

very white if we were in space this
white<00:00:31.289> light<00:00:31.560> coming<00:00:31.949> off<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.099> Sun<00:00:32.460> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
white light coming off the Sun is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.580 
white light coming off the Sun is
because<00:00:33.060> it's<00:00:33.239> temperature<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.870> 6000<00:00:34.470> Kelvin

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590

if<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.850> Sun<00:00:36.030> were<00:00:36.180> cooler<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.720> would<00:00:36.930> give<00:00:37.110> off

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
if the Sun were cooler it would give off

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
if the Sun were cooler it would give off
light<00:00:37.560> more<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> red<00:00:38.220> range<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
light more in the red range and if the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.380 
light more in the red range and if the
Sun<00:00:39.450> were<00:00:39.600> hotter<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.170> would<00:00:40.380> look<00:00:40.560> more<00:00:40.770> blue

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
Sun were hotter it would look more blue

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
Sun were hotter it would look more blue
