minecraft house there's a squid out

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.709 
minecraft house there's a squid out
there<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:15.120> started<00:00:15.330> playing<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.570> game

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
there I just started playing the game

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.450 
there I just started playing the game
I've<00:00:15.870> only<00:00:16.020> put<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> couple<00:00:16.590> hours<00:00:16.830> into<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
I've only put a couple hours into it and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300 
I've only put a couple hours into it and
I'm<00:00:18.330> thinking<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.320> might<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> best

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I'm thinking that this might be the best

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.429 
I'm thinking that this might be the best
house<00:00:20.609> ever<00:00:20.880> since<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.990> my<00:00:22.109> first<00:00:22.140> time

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
playing Minecraft and I'm thinking that

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.910 
playing Minecraft and I'm thinking that
