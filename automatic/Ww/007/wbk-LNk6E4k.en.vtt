maybe<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.710> as<00:00:52.710> far<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> construction

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
maybe but as far as the construction

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.119 
maybe but as far as the construction
goes<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.010> it's<00:00:56.750> $7.99<00:00:57.750> quality<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
goes for this it's $7.99 quality it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119 
goes for this it's $7.99 quality it's
what<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> expect<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:01.199> typical<00:01:01.469> stuff<00:01:01.920> like

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
what I expect but for typical stuff like

what I do
it's<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.329> adequate<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> works<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.559> fine

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it's very adequate it works just fine

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
it's very adequate it works just fine
for<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> clamp<00:01:08.119> right<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
pop filter you're doing good

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
pop filter you're doing good
but<00:01:21.270> anyway<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:22.200> gonna<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.040> video<00:01:23.340> like

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
but anyway I'm gonna in this video like

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420 
but anyway I'm gonna in this video like
I<00:01:23.670> said<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.600> gonna<00:01:24.780> test<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.770> pop<00:01:25.979> filters

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
I said I'm gonna test the pop filters

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.539 
I said I'm gonna test the pop filters
see<00:01:26.610> how<00:01:26.790> well<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> works<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> way<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
see how well it works and the way I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
see how well it works and the way I
figured<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.030> figured<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
figured about figured I would do this is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.830 
figured about figured I would do this is
you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.820> tone<00:01:33.119> twist<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.630> Peter

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you know that one tone twist or Peter

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.679 
you know that one tone twist or Peter
Piper<00:01:34.229> picked<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> peck<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.710> pickled<00:01:34.860> peppers

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
since<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> lot<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> Peace<00:01:37.619> hounds<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
since that has a lot of Peace hounds and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.270 
since that has a lot of Peace hounds and
P<00:01:38.549> sounds<00:01:39.000> create<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> lot<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.659> pops<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
P sounds create a lot of pops and the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
P sounds create a lot of pops and the
pop<00:01:41.460> filter<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.880> supposed<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> Creek<00:01:42.450> filter

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
pop filter is supposed to Creek filter

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
pop filter is supposed to Creek filter
out<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> lot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> pops<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.399> figured<00:01:45.180> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
out a lot of the pops I figured that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
out a lot of the pops I figured that
would<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.409> tongue<00:01:46.710> twister<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> used

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
would be a good tongue twister to used

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.590 
would be a good tongue twister to used
to<00:01:47.759> test<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.960> pop<00:01:49.320> filter<00:01:50.119> first<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.390> gonna

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to test this pop filter first I'm gonna

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
to test this pop filter first I'm gonna
read<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> pop<00:01:52.470> filter<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.040> then

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
read it with the pop filter and then

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.840 
read it with the pop filter and then
without<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> pop<00:01:53.790> filter<00:01:55.579> Peter<00:01:56.579> Piper

the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper
picked<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:52.980> I'm<00:02:53.980> assuming<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.610> Pops<00:02:54.940> are<00:02:55.360> a

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
picked and I'm assuming the Pops are a

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.530 
picked and I'm assuming the Pops are a
little<00:02:56.260> bit<00:02:56.440> louder<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.880> Pops<00:02:58.209> are<00:02:58.480> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
little bit louder and the Pops are a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.720 
little bit louder and the Pops are a
little<00:02:58.720> bit<00:02:58.930> more<00:02:58.959> annoying<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.739> again<00:03:00.459> I'm

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
little bit more annoying and again I'm

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.620 
little bit more annoying and again I'm
saying<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.540> pop<00:03:01.810> sounds<00:03:02.410> very<00:03:05.610> pronounced

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
saying the pop sounds very pronounced

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.890 
saying the pop sounds very pronounced
right<00:03:07.630> now<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.069> can<00:03:09.340> trigger<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.450> pop

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
right now just so I can trigger a pop

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.229 
right now just so I can trigger a pop
sound<00:03:11.319> in<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.950> recording<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:15.239> would

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
sound in the recording but I would

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.199 
sound in the recording but I would
definitely<00:03:16.720> recommend<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.859> cheap<00:03:18.400> pop

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209
