 to flavor 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.020
 to 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.189
 I have another burner 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.189
 like other arts 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.590
 we proceed 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:35.030
 we proceed to make the eggs 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.030
 scrambled we put some oil 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.570
 and the oil 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.530
 it is hot to put eggs and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.409
 that make us perfect 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.150
 we have the same cable that is not 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.150
 burn like white onion 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.319
 when we notice that the oil is already 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.319
 hot let's go 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.900
 a little garlic and fry means 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.620
 that which is already proceeding to put 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.620
 low 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.660
 until it crystallizes 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.030
 irregular flame 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.269
 later 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.269
 we put the white onion 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.280
 I like it 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.030

 a little 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.690
 we hope that the oil reaches its point 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.690
 and we do a strict 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.069
