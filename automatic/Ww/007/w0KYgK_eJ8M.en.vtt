the<00:04:47.700> rust-oleum<00:04:48.120> white<00:04:49.080> primer<00:04:49.729> which<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:50.910> have

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
the rust-oleum white primer which I have

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.930 
the rust-oleum white primer which I have
quite<00:04:52.979> a<00:04:53.040> little<00:04:53.220> bit<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.610> probably<00:04:54.540> about<00:04:55.940> 35

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
quite a little bit of probably about 35

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.219 
quite a little bit of probably about 35
percent<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.390> can<00:04:57.570> left<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.860> black

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
percent of the can left and the black

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.140 
percent of the can left and the black
gloss<00:05:01.229> enamel<00:05:01.800> which<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.430> probably<00:05:02.610> have<00:05:02.880> like

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
gloss enamel which I probably have like

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.800 
gloss enamel which I probably have like
you<00:05:03.419> know<00:05:03.770> yeah<00:05:04.800> 5<00:05:05.790> percent<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.390> can<00:05:06.540> left

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
you know yeah 5 percent of the can left

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.300 
you know yeah 5 percent of the can left
there's<00:05:07.080> only<00:05:07.200> a<00:05:07.290> little<00:05:07.410> bit<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.800> from

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
there's only a little bit of that from

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.940 
there's only a little bit of that from
when<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.490> redid<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.000> 4<00:05:09.210> horsepower<00:05:09.510> one<00:05:10.380> but

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
when I redid the 4 horsepower one but

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.060 
when I redid the 4 horsepower one but
that's<00:05:11.130> all<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.340> need<00:05:11.729> for<00:05:12.090> those<00:05:12.780> parts<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.470> I

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
that's all I need for those parts so I

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.010 
that's all I need for those parts so I
don't<00:05:14.940> know<00:05:15.000> maybe<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.330> might<00:05:15.540> sand<00:05:15.840> them<00:05:15.990> down

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
don't know maybe I might sand them down

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.820 
don't know maybe I might sand them down
a<00:05:16.169> little<00:05:16.380> bit<00:05:16.560> with<00:05:16.740> some<00:05:18.140> Emery<00:05:19.140> cloth<00:05:19.290> some

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
a little bit with some Emery cloth some

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.990 
a little bit with some Emery cloth some
60<00:05:20.250> grit<00:05:20.370> Emery<00:05:20.880> cloth<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.470> put<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:23.000> primer

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
60 grit Emery cloth and put the primer

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.810 
60 grit Emery cloth and put the primer
on<00:05:24.150> there<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.510> then<00:05:24.630> put<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.250> black<00:05:26.250> stuff<00:05:26.550> on

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
on there and then put the black stuff on

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.620 
on there and then put the black stuff on
or<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.990> gloss<00:05:28.560> enamel<00:05:29.100> what<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:30.030> takes<00:05:30.300> for

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
or the gloss enamel what that takes for

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.490 
or the gloss enamel what that takes for
at<00:05:30.810> least<00:05:30.930> 5<00:05:31.229> days<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.740> dry<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:33.750> hard

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
at least 5 days to dry to hard

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.870 
at least 5 days to dry to hard
hardness<00:05:35.070> so

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
hardness so

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.940 
hardness so
it<00:05:36.090> doesn't<00:05:36.330> scrape<00:05:36.480> off<00:05:36.690> but<00:05:36.960> I<00:05:37.170> don't<00:05:37.740> think

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
it doesn't scrape off but I don't think

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.010 
it doesn't scrape off but I don't think
anything<00:05:38.400> would<00:05:39.030> scrape<00:05:39.330> against<00:05:39.780> anything

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
anything would scrape against anything

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.620 
anything would scrape against anything
inside<00:05:40.530> here<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.160> just<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.520> stop<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.420> rust

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
inside here it's just to stop the rust

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.940 
inside here it's just to stop the rust
if<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:42.960> can<00:05:43.110> see<00:05:43.290> down<00:05:43.440> in<00:05:43.620> there<00:05:43.740> there's

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
if you can see down in there there's

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.740 
if you can see down in there there's
rust<00:05:44.220> right<00:05:44.430> there<00:05:44.760> but<00:05:46.400> don't<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.580> know<00:05:47.750> sort

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
rust right there but don't you know sort

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.160 
rust right there but don't you know sort
of<00:05:48.810> weatherproof<00:05:49.290> this<00:05:50.150> engine<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.810> give<00:05:52.020> it

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
of weatherproof this engine and give it

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.750 
of weatherproof this engine and give it
some<00:05:52.620> coats<00:05:52.950> because<00:05:53.340> that's<00:05:53.580> what

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
some coats because that's what

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.590 
some coats because that's what
rust-oleum<00:05:54.090> does<00:05:54.480> is<00:05:55.110> stop<00:05:55.470> rust<00:05:56.070> so<00:05:56.910> I<00:05:57.210> think

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
rust-oleum does is stop rust so I think

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.110 
rust-oleum does is stop rust so I think
I<00:05:57.840> might<00:05:57.990> do<00:05:58.140> that<00:05:58.320> but<00:05:58.560> you<00:05:59.310> know<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.760> know

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
I might do that but you know I you know

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.090 
I might do that but you know I you know
I'll<00:06:00.240> make<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.420> video<00:06:00.720> of<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:01.230> but<00:06:01.800> all<00:06:01.950> my

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
I'll make a video of it so but all my

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.950 
I'll make a video of it so but all my
memory<00:06:02.430> cards<00:06:02.700> are<00:06:02.820> getting<00:06:02.910> full<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:03.540> this

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
memory cards are getting full and this

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.450 
memory cards are getting full and this
is<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.170> only<00:06:04.290> memory<00:06:04.590> card<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.860> have<00:06:05.010> left<00:06:05.280> so

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
is the only memory card I have left so

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.260 
is the only memory card I have left so
I'm<00:06:05.910> going<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.090> go<00:06:06.180> ahead<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:08.030> put<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.150> wheels

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
I'm going to go ahead and put the wheels

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.630 
I'm going to go ahead and put the wheels
in<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.690> dishwasher<00:06:10.440> take<00:06:10.980> you<00:06:11.100> guys<00:06:11.220> with<00:06:11.280> me

external hard drive on all the memory

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.200 
external hard drive on all the memory
cards<00:06:17.730> and<00:06:17.910> get<00:06:18.210> those<00:06:18.330> out<00:06:18.480> of<00:06:18.540> the<00:06:18.690> way<00:06:18.720> so

know whatever alright so the tires are
in<00:06:30.030> here<00:06:31.190> let's<00:06:32.190> run<00:06:32.820> this<00:06:33.780> thing<00:06:35.420> gel<00:06:36.420> packs

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
in here let's run this thing gel packs

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
in here let's run this thing gel packs
in<00:06:36.990> I'm<00:06:37.800> sure<00:06:38.040> here<00:06:38.240> goes<00:06:39.240> this<00:06:39.960> main<00:06:40.170> cup<00:06:40.470> and

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
in I'm sure here goes this main cup and

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.540 
in I'm sure here goes this main cup and
this<00:06:41.040> plastic<00:06:41.370> booster<00:06:42.030> crap<00:06:42.360> that<00:06:43.550> nobody

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
this plastic booster crap that nobody

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.940 
this plastic booster crap that nobody
knows<00:06:44.670> if<00:06:44.790> it<00:06:44.880> works<00:06:45.090> but<00:06:45.900> just<00:06:46.440> put<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.800> in

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
knows if it works but just put that in

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.150 
knows if it works but just put that in
there<00:06:47.070> cuz<00:06:47.310> these<00:06:48.050> wheels<00:06:49.050> are<00:06:49.170> plastic<00:06:49.680> so

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.100 

you<00:06:53.160> know<00:06:53.690> doesn't<00:06:54.690> hurt<00:06:56.120> and<00:06:57.120> set<00:06:57.660> this<00:06:57.870> on

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
you know doesn't hurt and set this on

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.170 
you know doesn't hurt and set this on
heart<00:06:58.710> start<00:06:59.460> option<00:06:59.760> and<00:07:00.360> start<00:07:00.990> this<00:07:01.110> up<00:07:01.320> and

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180
