00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the operating system jelly bean Samsung

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
the operating system jelly bean Samsung

disable those if you don't not want them

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.310 
disable those if you don't not want them
so<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:01.150> start<00:03:01.390> just<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.810> apps<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.200> have

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
so you start just the apps I have

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.060 
so you start just the apps I have
installed<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.170> that's<00:03:05.320> what<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> app<00:03:05.770> drawer

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
installed so that's what the app drawer

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.170 
installed so that's what the app drawer
looks<00:03:06.370> like<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:08.700> what's<00:03:09.700> different<00:03:09.880> about

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
looks like and what's different about

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.470 
looks like and what's different about
the<00:03:10.420> apps<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.110> Samsung<00:03:11.610> changed<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.820> for

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
the apps is that Samsung changed it for

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.170 
the apps is that Samsung changed it for
example<00:03:13.870> if<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:13.990> go<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.260> phone<00:03:14.470> app<00:03:15.180> looks

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
example if you go to the phone app looks

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.800 
example if you go to the phone app looks
quite<00:03:16.540> different<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:18.450> keypad<00:03:19.450> here<00:03:19.690> is

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
quite different the keypad here is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.440 
quite different the keypad here is
different<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.380> logs<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.920> contacts<00:03:21.550> they're

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
different the logs the contacts they're

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.949 
different the logs the contacts they're
all<00:03:22.540> pretty<00:03:22.690> different<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.780> go<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
all pretty different and if you go to

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.309 
all pretty different and if you go to
the<00:03:26.110> camera<00:03:26.440> app

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.539 

and<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:33.099> camera<00:03:33.340> app<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:35.280> if<00:03:36.280> you

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
and so that's the camera app and if you

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:46.170 
and so that's the camera app and if you
go<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:38.430> let's<00:03:39.430> say<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:43.510> email<00:03:44.349> app<00:03:44.819> also<00:03:45.819> looks

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
go to let's say the email app also looks

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.410 
go to let's say the email app also looks
pretty<00:03:46.480> different<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:49.180> that's<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:50.019> email<00:03:50.590> app

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
pretty different so that's the email app

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.420 
pretty different so that's the email app
so<00:03:52.420> just<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.810> apps<00:03:53.019> themselves<00:03:53.829> have<00:03:54.400> changed

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
so just the apps themselves have changed

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.039 
so just the apps themselves have changed
and<00:03:55.739> that's<00:03:56.739> kind<00:03:57.129> of<00:03:57.220> nice<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.730> in<00:03:58.299> jelly

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
and that's kind of nice and in jelly

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.470 
and that's kind of nice and in jelly
bean<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.290> kind<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.560> get<00:03:59.769> your<00:03:59.950> widgets<00:04:00.480> some

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
bean you kind of get your widgets some

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.440 
bean you kind of get your widgets some
new<00:04:01.659> widgets<00:04:02.109> that<00:04:02.379> are<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:04.030> we're<00:04:04.269> just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
new widgets that are that we're just

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.629 
new widgets that are that we're just
themselves<00:04:04.629> look<00:04:05.019> different<00:04:05.379> too<00:04:05.530> since<00:04:06.310> I

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
themselves look different too since I

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.479 
themselves look different too since I
don't<00:04:07.209> know<00:04:07.359> if<00:04:07.480> that's<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.780> good<00:04:07.900> thing<00:04:07.959> since

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
don't know if that's a good thing since

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.759 
don't know if that's a good thing since
well<00:04:10.019> updates<00:04:11.019> are<00:04:11.200> supposed<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.680> look

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
well updates are supposed to look

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.809 
well updates are supposed to look
different<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.840> as<00:04:13.959> you<00:04:14.079> can<00:04:14.169> see<00:04:14.230> here<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.709> can

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
different so as you can see here you can

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.180 
different so as you can see here you can
drag<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:16.229> move<00:04:17.229> widgets<00:04:17.410> wherever<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.949> want

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
drag and move widgets wherever you want

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.310 
drag and move widgets wherever you want
and<00:04:18.489> then<00:04:18.729> jelly<00:04:18.970> bean<00:04:19.239> as<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.840> can<00:04:19.959> see<00:04:20.109> here

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
and then jelly bean as you can see here

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.650 
and then jelly bean as you can see here
when<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.829> moved<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.280> space<00:04:21.639> the<00:04:22.000> apps<00:04:22.210> that

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
when I moved to a space the apps that

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.950 
when I moved to a space the apps that
are<00:04:23.190> originally<00:04:24.190> in<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.460> place<00:04:24.699> move<00:04:25.090> move

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
are originally in that place move move

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360 
are originally in that place move move
themselves<00:04:26.169> out<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.949> way<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.280> can

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
themselves out of the way so you can

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.159 
themselves out of the way so you can
place<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:27.849> there<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.360> he<00:04:28.509> goes<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.780> resize

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
place it there and he goes and resize

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.570 
place it there and he goes and resize
the<00:04:29.460> widgets<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.900> your<00:04:32.050> preference<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:32.830> that's

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
the widgets to your preference so that's

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.480 
the widgets to your preference so that's
that<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:33.880> in<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:36.520> new<00:04:36.669> thing<00:04:36.970> here<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:38.490> Google

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
that and in the new thing here is Google

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.170 
that and in the new thing here is Google
now<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:41.260> can<00:04:41.409> access<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:42.099> by<00:04:42.180> either

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
now you can access that by either

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.550 
now you can access that by either
holding<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.750> Menu<00:04:43.990> button<00:04:44.020> or<00:04:45.570> hold<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.840> home

symbol<00:04:50.409> here<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.680> then<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.760> is<00:04:51.849> what<00:04:52.120> Google

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
symbol here and then this is what Google

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.110 
symbol here and then this is what Google
now<00:04:52.539> is<00:04:52.570> this<00:04:52.900> is<00:04:53.050> your<00:04:53.400> cards<00:04:54.400> down<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:54.909> and
