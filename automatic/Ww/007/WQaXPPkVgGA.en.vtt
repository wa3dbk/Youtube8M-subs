the into the chapter and there'll be a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
the into the chapter and there'll be a
stop<00:00:49.530> sign<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> dead<00:00:50.280> soldier<00:00:50.670> if

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
stop sign here with the dead soldier if

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.900 
stop sign here with the dead soldier if
you<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.750> pick<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.489> Intel<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you just pick up the Intel off of the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880 
you just pick up the Intel off of the
stop<00:00:54.149> sign<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.230> should<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
stop sign there you should get that one

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
stop sign there you should get that one
now<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> next<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.840> same<00:00:58.079> chapter

at<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> beginning<00:01:30.259> actually<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.650> most

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
at the beginning actually the most

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.330 
at the beginning actually the most
frustrating<00:01:33.500> chapter<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.950> least<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
frustrating chapter for me at least it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.679 
frustrating chapter for me at least it
was<00:01:35.430> actually<00:01:35.700> difficult<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.299> me<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.450> some

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
was actually difficult for me for some

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
was actually difficult for me for some
reason<00:01:36.740> chapter<00:01:37.740> 10<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.130> write<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
reason chapter 10 will write at the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.429 
reason chapter 10 will write at the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.920 
hideout here there's gonna be a long
cinematic<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.969> then<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.600> happens

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
cinematic and then this is what happens

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
cinematic and then this is what happens
right<00:02:07.079> after<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.530> cinematic<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.560> Intel

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
right after the cinematic and the Intel

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.410 
right after the cinematic and the Intel
is<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.910> desk<00:02:12.120> right

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
is actually on that little desk right

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.460 
is actually on that little desk right
over<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> right-hand<00:02:13.020> side

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
over to the right-hand side

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.190 
over to the right-hand side
right<00:02:14.400> next<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.690> actually<00:02:15.780> see<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
right next to you can actually see it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.990 
right next to you can actually see it
flashing<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.800> almost<00:02:16.950> impossible<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.820> miss

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
flashing it's almost impossible to miss

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.250 
flashing it's almost impossible to miss
so<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.200> cuts<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.280> part<00:02:20.700> 2<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.910> 3<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so this cuts it for part 2 of 3 for the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.080 
so this cuts it for part 2 of 3 for the
Intel<00:02:22.590> guides<00:02:22.830> make<00:02:23.130> sure<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.640> look<00:02:23.880> at<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
Intel guides make sure you look at the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.600 
Intel guides make sure you look at the
other<00:02:24.210> videos<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.750> find<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.170> other<00:02:25.350> two<00:02:26.190> parts

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
other videos to find the other two parts

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.980 
other videos to find the other two parts
