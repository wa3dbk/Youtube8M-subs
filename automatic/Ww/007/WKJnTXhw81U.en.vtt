00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 welcome to high street below 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.210
 we show you the technique to upload the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 little rope this is one of the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 exercises that we will use to improve 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.000
 our technique well for that exercise 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.000
 we will improve the strength 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.390
 well as its name suggests raise the 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.640
 Pretty rope consists of climbing fist 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.650
 about fist andrés that we could 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.560
 consider in putting and that would not be 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.720
 points well consider fists always 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.809
 and when the hands on top agree with 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.970
 the below provided this does not happen no 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.420
 what we consider point could be a 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.000
 armful 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.039
 that's fine once we know we've 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.019
 differentiated between that are chicks and 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.059
 which is a short stroke we are going to start 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.210
 the movement we could do this 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.640
 exercise or beginning to settle 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.430
 well starting standing in this case 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.280
 André is going to do it standing up and today we're going 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.140
 to explain by in the placement as 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.649
 you see something created on the legs 90 yes 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.649
 we could not 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.030
 well it is important once 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.870
 let's start to raise fists over the world 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.870
 hip movement 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.400
 this differential experience that 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.630
 we used to do when we made a stroke 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.210
 long movement of the long chain 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.220
 and in this case it's a bit of moving 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.020
 the hip is going to be much shorter 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.620
 Well, we know how we have placed ourselves 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.390
 now let's see how we would go up and how 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.640
 Andrew accompanies this movement of the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.640
 hip with the rise of chicks 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.440
 set as when low falls too 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.470
 little friends and get down on the downs 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.090
 this is very important because if 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.550
 we had some kind of injury type 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.740
 difficult test on the elbows this downhill 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.950
 we would have to do it more 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.950
 fast 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.390
 in your head 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.230
 not now 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.860
 yes 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.860
 do not 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.180
 call to 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.960
 or not 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 nothing
