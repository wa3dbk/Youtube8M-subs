it's the limited I had some problem my

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.140 
it's the limited I had some problem my
check<00:00:27.529> engine<00:00:27.770> light<00:00:28.099> came<00:00:28.369> on<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.730> other<00:00:28.880> day

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
check engine light came on the other day

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.229 
check engine light came on the other day
and<00:00:29.450> I'll<00:00:30.380> let<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:30.739> see<00:00:30.770> if<00:00:31.070> you<00:00:31.189> can<00:00:31.369> feel<00:00:32.060> or

and I'll let you see if you can feel or

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:41.990 
and I'll let you see if you can feel or
hear<00:00:32.419> how<00:00:32.630> sound

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.369 

it's<00:00:43.000> got<00:00:43.149> 98<00:00:43.660> thousand<00:00:44.170> miles<00:00:44.379> and<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:47.140> first

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
it's got 98 thousand miles and at first

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.840 
it's got 98 thousand miles and at first
the<00:00:47.680> engine<00:00:48.250> light<00:00:48.370> was<00:00:48.520> just<00:00:48.730> blinking<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
the engine light was just blinking and

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.960 
the engine light was just blinking and
now<00:00:52.720> it's<00:00:52.899> gone<00:00:53.050> on<00:00:53.260> solid<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.280> I<00:00:57.309> took<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.699> into

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
now it's gone on solid so I took it into

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.329 
now it's gone on solid so I took it into
a<00:00:58.420> Riley<00:00:59.019> and<00:00:59.140> plugged<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.500> into<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.890> computer

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
a Riley and plugged it into the computer

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.270 
a Riley and plugged it into the computer
right<00:01:00.790> in<00:01:00.820> here<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:02.320> gave<00:01:02.500> me<00:01:02.769> a<00:01:02.800> error

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
right in here and it gave me a error

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.649 
right in here and it gave me a error
code<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:04.259> misfire<00:01:05.259> on<00:01:05.560> cylinder<00:01:05.979> five<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.479> this

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
code of misfire on cylinder five so this

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.359 
code of misfire on cylinder five so this
video<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.050> going<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.229> be<00:01:08.380> about<00:01:08.560> how<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:08.890> repair

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
video is going to be about how I repair

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:29.550 
video is going to be about how I repair
that<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:24.399> this<00:01:24.940> is<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:27.060> v8<00:01:28.060> 4.7<00:01:28.840> liter<00:01:28.869> engine

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
that and this is the v8 4.7 liter engine

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.609 
that and this is the v8 4.7 liter engine
and<00:01:30.390> I've<00:01:31.390> had<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.750> problem<00:01:31.990> before<00:01:32.229> where

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
and I've had this problem before where

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.590 
and I've had this problem before where
one<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.009> cylinders<00:01:33.310> misfired<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.300> it<00:01:34.450> was

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
one of the cylinders misfired and it was

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.710 
one of the cylinders misfired and it was
this<00:01:34.780> cylinder<00:01:35.440> number<00:01:35.679> one<00:01:36.420> gave<00:01:37.420> an<00:01:37.570> error

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
this cylinder number one gave an error

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.200 
this cylinder number one gave an error
code<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.850> p0<00:01:40.200> 3:01<00:01:41.200> at<00:01:41.679> that<00:01:41.830> time<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.970> time

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
code of p0 3:01 at that time this time

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.330 
code of p0 3:01 at that time this time
it<00:01:43.360> gave<00:01:43.509> me<00:01:43.690> an<00:01:43.780> error<00:01:43.990> misfire<00:01:44.649> on<00:01:44.679> cylinder

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
it gave me an error misfire on cylinder

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.100 
it gave me an error misfire on cylinder
five<00:01:45.610> which<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:46.170> p0<00:01:47.170> three<00:01:47.979> zero<00:01:48.640> five<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.209> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
five which is p0 three zero five and so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.169 
five which is p0 three zero five and so
the<00:01:50.200> way<00:01:50.319> that<00:01:50.520> Toyota<00:01:51.520> has<00:01:51.550> it<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.030> their

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
the way that Toyota has it is their

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.029 
the way that Toyota has it is their
cylinder<00:01:52.599> one<00:01:52.810> two<00:01:53.470> three<00:01:54.429> four<00:01:55.270> five<00:01:56.080> six<00:01:56.709> and

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
cylinder one two three four five six and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.790 
cylinder one two three four five six and
then<00:01:57.099> seven<00:01:57.580> s<00:01:58.119> their<00:01:58.360> eights<00:01:59.050> on<00:01:59.319> that<00:01:59.500> side

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
then seven s their eights on that side

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.400 
then seven s their eights on that side
so<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.880> need<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.149> get<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> cylinder<00:02:02.319> right

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
so we need to get to the cylinder right

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.190 
so we need to get to the cylinder right
down<00:02:02.619> there<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.239> it's<00:02:04.239> really<00:02:04.690> simple

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
down there and it's really simple

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.900 
down there and it's really simple
there's<00:02:05.349> just<00:02:05.530> one<00:02:05.709> ten<00:02:05.979> millimeter<00:02:06.399> bolt<00:02:06.670> and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
there's just one ten millimeter bolt and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.990 
there's just one ten millimeter bolt and
one<00:02:07.630> clip<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.380> electronics<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.190> then

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
one clip for the electronics and then

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.330 
one clip for the electronics and then
you<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.209> pull<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:16.980> remove<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.160> one

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you can pull that out remove that one

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.570 
you can pull that out remove that one
clip<00:02:19.300> clip<00:02:20.110> simple

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
clip clip simple

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930 
clip clip simple
gonna<00:02:22.060> pinch<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.960> top<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.590> off<00:02:23.730> move<00:02:24.730> that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
gonna pinch it top that off move that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.420 
gonna pinch it top that off move that
out<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.240> way

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
out of the way

to undo the negative charger the
negative<00:04:23.630> end<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.930> battery<00:04:24.290> because<00:04:26.440> that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
negative end of the battery because that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.940 
negative end of the battery because that
should<00:04:27.650> help<00:04:27.800> clear<00:04:28.220> our<00:04:28.400> error<00:04:28.880> code<00:04:29.889> okay<00:04:30.889> so
