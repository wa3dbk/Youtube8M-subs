I'm<00:00:18.840> guessing<00:00:19.500> somewhere<00:00:20.390> 65<00:00:21.390> probably<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
I'm guessing somewhere 65 probably I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.160 
I'm guessing somewhere 65 probably I
think<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.320> opinion<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.779> if

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
think in my opinion that if the if

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.160 
think in my opinion that if the if
Dallas<00:00:28.710> can't<00:00:29.640> shoot<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.750> can't<00:00:31.050> make

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
they want to do it just because the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
they want to do it just because the
versatility<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.340> their<00:01:02.699> team<00:01:03.049> whereas<00:01:04.049> the

versatility of their team whereas the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
versatility of their team whereas the
Dallas<00:01:04.530> Mavericks<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
Dallas Mavericks don't really have that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.020 
Dallas Mavericks don't really have that
much<00:01:06.600> versatility<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.640> they<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.700> much

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
much versatility because they are much

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
much versatility because they are much
slower<00:01:09.600> than<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.350> Oklahoma<00:01:11.040> City<00:01:11.250> Dirk

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
slower than the Oklahoma City Dirk

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
slower than the Oklahoma City Dirk
Nowitzki<00:01:12.060> amazing<00:01:13.020> player<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.470> he's<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.799> as

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
Nowitzki amazing player but he's not as

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
Nowitzki amazing player but he's not as
fast<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.460> Tyson<00:01:15.299> Chandler<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.810> he<00:01:16.200> had<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
fast as Tyson Chandler if he had to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.940 
fast as Tyson Chandler if he had to
guard<00:01:16.650> him<00:01:17.659> for<00:01:18.659> example<00:01:19.080> Russell<00:01:19.560> Westbrook

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
guard him for example Russell Westbrook

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.399 
guard him for example Russell Westbrook
a<00:01:20.130> lot<00:01:20.400> faster<00:01:20.850> than<00:01:21.299> Jason<00:01:21.720> Kidd<00:01:21.960> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
a lot faster than Jason Kidd just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
a lot faster than Jason Kidd just
because<00:01:22.650> Jason<00:01:23.009> Kidd's<00:01:23.189> older<00:01:23.549> he's<00:01:23.909> special

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
because Jason Kidd's older he's special

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
because Jason Kidd's older he's special
