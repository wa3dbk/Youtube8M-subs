 the toilet application that a little v 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.520

 from time to time I find that facebook 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.720
 it's getting a little tacky 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.799
 done it's a little for the old or there 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.009
 the older generation 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.080

 the express point I find that it's 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.320
 a little too technical for me to 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.299
 the moment but here I am a little 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.000
