Indus<00:00:59.120> for<00:01:00.020> light<00:01:00.320> setup<00:01:01.149> first<00:01:02.149> I<00:01:02.570> test<00:01:03.379> the

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
Indus for light setup first I test the

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.600 
Indus for light setup first I test the
hairline<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.190> see<00:01:04.970> how<00:01:05.390> it's<00:01:05.659> covering<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
hairline and see how it's covering and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.080 
hairline and see how it's covering and
sending<00:01:07.610> its<00:01:07.790> light<00:01:08.140> just<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.409> cut<00:01:09.770> and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
sending its light just to cut and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.889 
sending its light just to cut and
separate<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.509> subject<00:01:11.810> from<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:13.040> background

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
separate the subject from the background

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.859 
separate the subject from the background
now<00:01:14.899> I<00:01:15.170> turn<00:01:15.320> on<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.520> light<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:17.659> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
now I turn on the light for the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:31.730 
now I turn on the light for the
background

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310 

the<00:01:32.280> light<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> background<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.960> now

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the light for the background is now

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.180 
the light for the background is now
balanced<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> exact<00:01:36.720> same<00:01:37.020> amount<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.740> will

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
balanced to the exact same amount I will

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.660 
balanced to the exact same amount I will
be<00:01:38.400> using<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.960> front<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.830> subject<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
be using on the front of the subject it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.770 
be using on the front of the subject it
is<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.470> f-16<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> background<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.150> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
is now f-16 for the background and it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.370 
is now f-16 for the background and it
will<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.170> f-16<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.790> subject<00:01:48.300> as<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
will be f-16 on the subject as you have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.670 
will be f-16 on the subject as you have
seen<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.400> metering<00:01:50.759> session

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
seen in the metering session

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.399 
seen in the metering session
so<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.369> only<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:54.360> back<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.170> lit

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so now you see only the back that is lit

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.010 
so now you see only the back that is lit
it<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.190> important<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.940> Heike<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it is important in the Heike that the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.430 
it is important in the Heike that the
back<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:59.250> lit<00:01:59.580> evenly<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.780> why<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> use<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
back is lit evenly this is why I use the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.529 
back is lit evenly this is why I use the
softbox<00:02:02.040> paint<00:02:02.550> in<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.229> power<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.500> center<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
softbox paint in it power to center and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.820 
softbox paint in it power to center and
they<00:02:06.539> are<00:02:06.780> giving<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.440> f-16<00:02:08.369> all<00:02:08.970> even

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
they are giving the f-16 all even

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.970 
they are giving the f-16 all even
background<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.880> main<00:02:12.269> light<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.570> on<00:02:12.989> it's

volume pictures and shadows that we will

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.130 
volume pictures and shadows that we will
use<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.390> literation

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.229 

there's<00:03:17.140> one<00:03:17.470> peak<00:03:17.799> where<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.069> black<00:03:18.400> peak<00:03:19.000> or

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
there's one peak where the black peak or

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
not touching the wall so it is exactly

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.350 
not touching the wall so it is exactly
