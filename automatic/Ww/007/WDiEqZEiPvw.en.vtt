know the channel hasn't really been that
consistent<00:01:27.299> anyway<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.900> guys<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.229> been

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
consistent anyway and you guys have been

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
consistent anyway and you guys have been
patient<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.479> being<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
patient but for the time being the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
patient but for the time being the
background<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.799> actually<00:01:32.240> white<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.479> i<00:01:33.689> can't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
background is actually white and i can't

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
background is actually white and i can't
like<00:01:34.079> change<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> back<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.770> forth<00:01:34.979> i<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
like change it back and forth i got to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.340 
like change it back and forth i got to
figure<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> way<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.079> both

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
figure out a way to like have both

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.450 
figure out a way to like have both
backdrops<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.430> both<00:01:38.700> channels<00:01:39.409> because<00:01:40.460> it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
backdrops for both channels because it's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.359 
backdrops for both channels because it's
confusing<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.240> hard<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> explain<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.500> maybe

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
confusing it's hard to explain but maybe

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.590 
confusing it's hard to explain but maybe
for<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.700> time<00:01:44.909> being<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> do

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
for the time being I'm going to do

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.030 
for the time being I'm going to do
webcam<00:01:45.810> videos<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:46.920> know

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
webcam videos like this I don't know

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
webcam videos like this I don't know
like<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.729> don't<00:01:47.759> know<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> guys<00:01:48.360> come<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
like I don't know what you guys come to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.240 
like I don't know what you guys come to
the<00:01:48.840> channel<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.530> come<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the channel for do you come for like the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
the channel for do you come for like the
high<00:01:50.369> quality<00:01:50.820> production<00:01:51.299> or<00:01:51.540> no<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> maybe

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
high quality production or no so maybe

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.530 
high quality production or no so maybe
sometimes<00:01:53.460> I'll<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.210> don't<00:01:54.360> really

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
sometimes I'll do this I don't really

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.209 
sometimes I'll do this I don't really
necessarily<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
necessarily like this because this is a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.160 
necessarily like this because this is a
little<00:01:56.460> typical<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.719> want<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> say

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
little typical but I just want to say

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.560 
little typical but I just want to say
