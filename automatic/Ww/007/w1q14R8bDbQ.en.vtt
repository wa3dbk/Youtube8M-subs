00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.120
 December 16 thousand 773 the settlers were 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.860
 rebellion in the port of boston as 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.289
 consequence of the approval by large 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.209
 Brittany in that same year to force 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.549
 pay taxes to the metropolis for the 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.650
 import of different products between 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.720
 them the tea to benefit so a 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.550
 British company to whom settlers 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.250
 they boycotted buying tea in another 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.439
 site we can not enjoy the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.509
 full gameplay like that but until 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.039
 sequence number 5 but if 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.839
 delight us much before the 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.730
 innovations and novelties that this 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.520
 assassin's creed delivery has put 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.920
 our disposition today we will analyze the 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.949
 combat system remastered by 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.910
 complete with respect to previous deliveries 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.039
 presenting greater fluency and 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.780
 movement speed at the same time as a 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.149
 the simplicity and elegance 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.059
 Massive combats in assassin's 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.949
 believe 3 we can do without the pointed 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.469
 and the individual selection with the r1 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.300
 being able to change objectives 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.359
 more quickly if we prefer it 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.250
 depending on the situation the arsenal of weapons 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.710
 will vary during the game as we are 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.060
 playing as a templar or murderer the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.040
 tomahawk layout 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.460
 and an arc will make the difference in 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.380
 the latter this mission takes place 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.509
 after we are forced to 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.700
 heading to Boston a place 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.700
 linked with more than what can be 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.860
 get to believe throughout the events 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.320
 assassin's creed 3 puts us first 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.179
 place in london where we will control 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.100
 one of the most recognized templars of 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.869
 the time who after traveling to 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.479
 america to stay in their colonies 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.909
 Britons will fall in love with one of the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.860
 members of the mojo tribe to leave 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.750
 a descendant who will turn out to be 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.310
 much later the murderer 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.289
 protagonist 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.750
 sequence number 3 allows us to 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.090
 In order to control even at a young murderer 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.679
 that he will watch as his people to burn 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.569
 in flames by order of the same 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.280
 organization that your father directs that 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.049
 ambitiously seeks expansion of his 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.209
 power and they see the tribes a good 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.909
 opportunity to start such a project 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.500
 connor then play revenge for everything 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.689
 promoter of the action that destroys his 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.840
 village and he killed his mother and will grow up in 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.340
 training over the years 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.709
 we will learn to move quickly 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.610
 for the trees and to hunt improving 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.190
 progressively our skills 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.200
 once formed Boston will become 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.460
 our main stage where 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.070
 we will have to fight for the interests 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.530
 own the protagonist as for those of 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.960
 the rebellion that begins precisely in 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.600
 this mission the boston tea riot 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.150
 where we will invade first 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.730
 the ships of the port and throw into the sea 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.430
 tons of tea while we survive 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.350
 waves of constant enemies looking for a 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 strategic point in this mission in the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.120
 battle will be crucial to fulfill 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.580
 optional missions we can use weapons 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 like the bow or the rifle to protect 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
 our allies over long distances 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
 from an elevated position or hang 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.400
 someone with the rope to decorate the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.709
 stage with a good banner the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.530
 Assassination recruitment will also be 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.180
 present in assassin's creed 3 and it will be 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.400
 much use to prevent us 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.140
 attack multitudinously so 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.790
 It will be easy to completely evade 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.060
 battle or finish off our enemies 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.950
 in the back this little sequence is 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.630
 a clear example of the great work that the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.310
 assassin's creed 3 ha team 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.530
 made to improve the system of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.330
 Combat the best way to enhance 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.860
 our skills 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.930
 attack a small group of enemies of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.000
 stealthy way will change the hidden sheet 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.070
 to end up with one or two more enemies 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.230
 and select the job to finish off the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.360
 collective keeping the assets in 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.610
 every moment trying not to take damage 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.290
 to maintain that advantage and stability 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.790
 that we had obtained at the beginning of 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.400
 combat 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.379
 how can we get the biggest 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.379
 potential to the skills that you 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.299
 present the r1 at our disposal 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.640
 will be totally irrelevant in 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.280
 the assassin's creed 3 combats on 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.959
 circle will be your substitute becoming 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.900
 in the forerunner of any movement 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.609
 what we want to do will follow our 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.709
 provision of course the attack 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.629
 Basic and counterattack as 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.239
 we can disarm our enemies if 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.340
 so we want it every time the enemy 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.290
 get ready to attack us a symbol of 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.239
 red warning will appear 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.799
 on top of the enemy subject so 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.410
 we must be agile and tighten the 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.789
 circle at the most appropriate time if 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.370
 we managed to make this movement 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.070
 time a range of possibilities 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.990
 will open then before us we can 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.090
 hit the triangle again to finish 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.070
 with him with a gun with the bow 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.470
 or simply with a rope according to your 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.479
 selection is obviously not the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.949
 most recommended movement 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.690
 we will require that ammunition more 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.330
 go ahead to go hunting or in 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.400
 more extreme situations if we decide 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.870
 give back to the circle we will be 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.260
 capable of separating the enemy from 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.270
 us without causing you any harm 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.550
 in case we want for example 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.550
 concentrate our attack power on 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.890
 another subject more dangerous the square 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.630
 It will allow us to fight so the 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.310
 combo square circle is the most 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.890
 effective to end enemies 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.900
 weakest and with the X last 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.400
 we can disarm the enemy if so 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.440
 we want 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.720
 the basic attack is still the most 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.360
 effective and from which we must abuse more 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.250
 but give the circle in time in the 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.199
 If they attack us, it will be crucial 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.470
 so as not to lose this ability in combat 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.360
 and thus avoid receiving harm in summary the 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.520
 combat will be much more frantic 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.169
 then we will no longer have the blacksmith to 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.270
 leave it tight for a long time 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.120
 so we will have to attack to get out 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.889
 advantage to the enemy this has been a 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.380
 review of one of the mode missions 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.729
 individual of assassin's creed 3 no 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.889
 forget to leave in the comments 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.360
 your opinions about the game or 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.550
 any of the questions that you 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.470
 present that they will try to be answered 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.120
 in the next videos 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.120
 greetings goodbye guys
