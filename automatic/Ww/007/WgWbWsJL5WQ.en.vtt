00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.200
 hello I 'm simon from al afghani 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.030
 berlin is looking for something today 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.680
 different perspective here 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.930
 because I have you some products 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.300
 brought to say a few 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.369
 I have training buser here and would like 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.189
 About these products so a few sentences 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.109
 get rid of brewster training 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.939
 Nitrogen brewsters are named for that 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.919
 made are suitable and one 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.869
 efficiency for training 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.220
 that means you are able to raise 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.720
 to train harder 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.300
 You are able to stand a little longer 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.790
 train and there are training 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.650
 booster for suitable open course 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.510
 People training booster that just tired 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.850
 are and maybe one more 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.200
 workout on the plan have around 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.880
 not to motivate a bit 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.710
 but I say always tried with 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.390
 something not to push up but 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.730
 just like a booster in one day 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.300
 knew doing well to give quasi yet 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.500
 times so often sit different patterns 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.970
 There is on the market I have here 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.580
 some of course, as well 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.290
 All tested so far are two products 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.510
 have done well for this club 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.660
 we once the plasma pump and once 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.310
 that only extreme two products are the ones of 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.900
 the ingredients here in any case 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.750
 I can be very transparent here 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.390
 say no substances are included 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.520
 which are questionable or where to worry 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.740
 must have who is sensitive to caffeine 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.060
 must of course with the dosage 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.010
 take care that but taken in the basics 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.090
 even the only one else have 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.730
 these two products no 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 driving potential then but each 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.120
 Product of like the end of the new 2.0 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:41.530
 There was the old knox around there 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.330
 pro 2.0 has such a small scarf 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.610
 it turned out that the labels 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.070
 are not compliant that substance 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.000
 it is not included in the eu 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.240
 is capable of doing so the whole 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 product is not marketable and that 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.080
 of course buy the master 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.540
 training book such little scarfs 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.040
 yes I have tested it from the effect 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.710
 I do not think that's as strong as that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 old but it is a product to him 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.030
 now with our legislation 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.030
 before that , then we have a brand new one 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.960
 product pulse 4 is new training 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.670
 not booster 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.530
 the packaging is different that is here 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.320
 today, therefore, not only this comes 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 but also the composition 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.410
 is another we have the whole up 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.540
 basis of creation 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.580
 that is, the trend of trainings had 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.130
 I can build up a completely different way 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.770
 but to say honestly have great 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.640
 Effect can also be a very good product 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.740
 my problem 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.950
 and here I do not really see any 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.980
 danger potential yes so a certain 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.230
 Factor ix is available here at matmour 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.200
 app an american product that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.850
 counterpart to the 3d check at jack 3d gave 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.470
 it is also such a scandal of 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.730
 certainly not without was 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 Here we have a product what that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.060
 counterpart is from the effect ago 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.500
 Let's look at the ingredients 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.360
 Of course, we do not have many substances 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.940
 are as easy to classify as 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.530
 maybe these two here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.570
 That's why I say factor ix here 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.550
 would training would like to try 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.530
 and maybe already experience with 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.480
 postern has certainly this 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.940
 try it shows definitely 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.380
 I think that you are in front of this 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.360
 small can often only half full 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.790
 it's a whole 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.100
 Ordinary thing I really like the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.750
 and tastes I find him extreme 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.660
 tasty because he is very American 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.400
 So it tastes like you can say 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.380
 now out of here no ranking cognition 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.780
 just is not that these products 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.790
 weaker than this one or that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 here stronger than this one can do that 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.400
 do not say so 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.930
 every organism reacts differently 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.520
 training booster we have 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.040
 different compositions that 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.260
 are completely different and if he is such a 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.390
 small survey would like to have you 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.310
 These training booster cost and before 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.410
 all things which portion sizes you 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.300
 what do you get the single portion 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.430
 costs and so on, that's exactly what I have 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.050
 everything converted the link to find 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.740
 you on my website maintains of 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.850
 this video 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.130
 I've just made the effort 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.780
 all these tradings booster all times 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.220
 compete against each other together to 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.080
 let in a comparison in one 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.000
 Price comparison so that you can see 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.770
 which of course the individual portion 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.120
 ultimately costs on the other link 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.900
 the stele installation below you see on 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.150
 my website 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.770
 I have such a few first reports 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.540
 written on each of these products 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.670
 also forgive a few stars that is 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.620
 you see my experience in again 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.780
 short reports and my ratings 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.000
 here in terms of pump and in terms of 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.200
 mental focus also the taste and 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.330
 I have the price performance ratio 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.310
 rated therefore you is even a 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.650
 actor in and then you can look 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.140
 consider whether in training booster times 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.370
 want to try or if you say you 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.380
 Just make yourself a black tea 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.780
 because a black tea has one too 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.430
 small poster effect of these dates 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.870
 it used to be called earlier 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.350
 Ultimately , caffeine too today 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.250
 Naturally stimulating becomes easy 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.550
 performance enhancing and in contrast to 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.600
 Coffee keeps the caffeine out of the topic 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.130
 a little longer 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.780
 and that's why it's good too 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.979
 thing before training is required 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.660
 Of course you always have the products 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.550
 not overdosed i also recommend here 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.320
 not every workout on the 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.910
 to set workout space but the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.419
 to use sporadically depending on desire and 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.950
 mood 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.440
 maybe not just in days or days 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.390
 is bad but also on days 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.040
 they really feel good about quasi 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.110
 another icing on the cake 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.750
 that's fun and brings training 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.140
 neat power always try it 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.610
 value 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.990
 I already told you two 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.610
 I have you left to these products 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.690
 below this video series 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.280
 definitely worth it 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.600
 It was time 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.040
 we'll see each other in the next 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.910
 video many greetings 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.910
