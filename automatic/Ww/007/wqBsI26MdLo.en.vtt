00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello dear readers and spectators of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.690
 your pc 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.759
 my name is niklas and i present 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.600
 you guys in this video the my cloud ii x2 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.150
 from western digital a compact solution 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.060
 from western digital heat operation the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.039
 michael michael or x4 tested stop 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.990
 mainly intended for home users 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.320
 but also for smaller companies and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 the x2 stands for two in this case 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.020
 disk bays we have and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.090
 our model is already here 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 equipped with two western digital 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 red disks a 4 terabytes so 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 a total of eight terabytes 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 storage capacity here with this model 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.200
 available and that look something 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.449
 scope of delivery and we will have a look 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 the content of this box more closely 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.320
 we'll see a quick guide here 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.270
 the included is probably ever that 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 most necessary is explained to the iCloud in 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 to take operation 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 then we have a power adapter 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.949
 Of course she also needs electricity 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 two different adapters on it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.909
 have one here for North America 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.490
 and then for Europe and for all 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.430
 Last still a network cable with it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.439
 can also go to the net 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.080
 the macro x2 has a display 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.450
 not just me those status leds though 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 that there is also sufficient as we the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 most about the software solve here 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 once the back two usb 3.0 ports 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.829
 we still have to the memory 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.540
 Expand if we want to hike and 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.380
 then the power connection 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 Of course, the hard disks can also 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.799
 simply switch to the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 top open this cover 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.079
 because here with this little one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.689
 screw the device remove the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.250
 Hold the two hard disks and then 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.350
 can the hard disks here completely 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.299
 just pull out and through others 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.829
 Models exchange quantity want here 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.590
 pre-installed the western digital 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.890
 hard drives keep the disks 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.500
 a longevity designed content for 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.640
 the continuous operation suitable are the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.770
 microetxexpress equipped with a 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.530
 2 ghz processor and 512 mb 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.660
 memory and of course the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.319
 possibility then your data there 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.300
 store 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.780
 the whole thing happens via a software 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.709
 or via a webinterface this one 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.500
 I already in others 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.630
 videos presented in the video to the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.620
 michael otto the broker or x4 why 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.180
 I now here in this video once 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.010
 but do not want to do that, you see 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.810
 now the link to the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.160
 other videos and you can then there 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.900
 look again at the explanation 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.880
 There you will see how your backups 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.690
 can create which 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.580
 There are options and there are 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.500
 what raid modes the my cloud 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.880
 supports 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.709
 I hope you have this short video 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.610
 I would also like one over 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.500
 thumbs up high

 and if you like our youtube-channel 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.010
 subscribed if you still ask yourself 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.880
 or suggestions then have it off in
