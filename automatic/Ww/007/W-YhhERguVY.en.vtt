winning streak I believe that's a

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.479 
winning streak I believe that's a
five-game<00:00:41.510> winning<00:00:41.719> streak<00:00:41.839> is<00:00:42.469> is<00:00:43.159> a<00:00:43.219> win

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
five-game winning streak is is a win

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.129 
five-game winning streak is is a win

over Montereau via you know despite
their<00:00:45.469> record<00:00:45.799> remains<00:00:46.069> one<00:00:46.639> of<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.729> most

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
their record remains one of the most

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.729 
their record remains one of the most
talented<00:00:47.059> teams<00:00:47.569> in<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.899> Novalis<00:00:48.199> game

tonight<00:00:49.069> is<00:00:49.280> probably<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.940> championship

tonight is probably the championship

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.539

being<00:00:50.780> mean<00:00:50.959> to<00:00:51.109> say<00:00:51.289> that<00:00:51.319> yeah<00:00:51.889> I<00:00:51.920> think<00:00:52.190> so

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
being mean to say that yeah I think so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:53.979 
being mean to say that yeah I think so
and<00:00:52.699> I<00:00:52.760> think<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:53.059> probably<00:00:53.089> stamps<00:00:53.869> the

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
and I think it probably stamps the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.590 
and I think it probably stamps the
winner<00:00:54.199> despite<00:00:54.679> with<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.920> CIF<00:00:55.280> Jose<00:00:55.819> as<00:00:56.299> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
winner despite with the CIF Jose as the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.849 
winner despite with the CIF Jose as the
team<00:00:56.749> to<00:00:56.899> beat<00:00:57.019> them<00:00:57.229> the<00:00:57.319> valley<00:00:57.530> division
