I was trust upon Vic today that he's
going<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.250> able<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.489> do<00:03:01.580> his<00:03:01.700> job<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.390> think

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
going to be able to do his job I think

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.180 
going to be able to do his job I think
you<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.380> Tim<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.470> from<00:03:06.680> from<00:03:06.980> me

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
you know Tim this is from from me

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.180 
you know Tim this is from from me
outside<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:09.200> invite<00:03:09.560> says<00:03:09.769> already<00:03:10.040> he's

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
outside in the invite says already he's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.130 
outside in the invite says already he's
talking<00:03:10.550> about<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:10.880> think<00:03:11.150> nothing<00:03:12.019> has

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
talking about it I think nothing has

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.360 
talking about it I think nothing has
been<00:03:12.170> easy<00:03:12.500> for<00:03:12.769> Tim<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.850> know<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:14.120> not<00:03:14.300> been

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
been easy for Tim you know it's not been

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
been easy for Tim you know it's not been
and<00:03:16.370> then<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.790> plane<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.420> not<00:03:17.630> been

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
and then on the plane it's not been

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.410 
and then on the plane it's not been
whatever<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:18.800> think<00:03:19.100> he<00:03:19.250> has<00:03:20.000> people's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
whatever so I think he has people's

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.070 
whatever so I think he has people's
respect

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
respect

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.990 
respect
so<00:03:21.500> he<00:03:21.709> has<00:03:21.860> more<00:03:22.100> than<00:03:22.250> because<00:03:22.580> he's<00:03:22.760> at<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
so he has more than because he's at the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.750 
so he has more than because he's at the
wild<00:03:23.269> card<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.810> think<00:03:24.350> when<00:03:25.130> all<00:03:25.280> said<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.700> done

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
wild card I think when all said and done

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.300 
wild card I think when all said and done
nobody<00:03:26.630> will<00:03:26.780> be<00:03:26.870> there<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.890> very<00:03:28.069> end

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310
