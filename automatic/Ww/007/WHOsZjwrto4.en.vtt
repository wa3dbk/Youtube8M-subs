00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
basically in the Brain Age games you try

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
basically in the Brain Age games you try
to<00:01:19.200> make<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.530> brain<00:01:19.830> age<00:01:20.130> 20<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:21.299> doing<00:01:21.659> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to make your brain age 20 by doing so

they ask you to complete a given game
with<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> time<00:01:28.650> limit<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.210> good<00:01:30.390> feature

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with the time limit it's a good feature

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
with the time limit it's a good feature
to<00:01:30.780> challenge<00:01:31.290> those<00:01:31.560> who<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.130> game

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to challenge those who think this game

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.450 
to challenge those who think this game
is<00:01:32.400> too<00:01:32.759> easy<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> training<00:01:35.040> mode<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.340> this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you basically sell them by rod a problem

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
you basically sell them by rod a problem
either<00:01:48.960> addition<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.619> subtraction<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.460> in
