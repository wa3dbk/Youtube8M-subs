 Arraial turned municipality 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.650
 already without the beautiful name of são 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.650
 of the crossroads because one of the

 14 thousand inhabitants stands out in the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.420

 dairy product becoming a reference in 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.220
 cheese making 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.219
 cruzília is also the cradle of the largest race

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.579
 few people know is not studied in the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.049
 schools that have to do with the course 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.390
 Family junqueira family of Baron

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 race here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.620
 along with that, the Baron's family 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.890
 was a victim in the 19th century 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.989
 beginning in the mid-19th century of a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.269
 great slave revolt then this 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.610
 history of the beautiful slaves revolt 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.400
 cross is a very curious thing and that the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.920
 from that time many laws against 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.540
 slavery in the country change and horse 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000
 mangalarga came along with this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.340
 historical episode that is the revolt of 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.859
 slaves of the beautiful cross in the 19th century 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.260
 grew the number of nurseries grew 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.069
 number of animals and with this expansion of 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.930
 breed 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.280
 there is a lack of skilled and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.280
 specialized 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.920
 so since 2009 was made partnership 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.709
 between abc cmm SENAR 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.209
 with this priority to teach the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.209
 work with horses 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.730
 the Baron's School of Culture team 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.549
 alfenas was inaugurated in 2010 in 2011 and 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.989
 formed the first group specializing in 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.810
 long sleeve walker 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.239
 this second class of 15 students 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.260
 complete course in 2013 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:21.700
 my horses tone the previous trunk 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:27.480
 in the front in the hill already commerce taught 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.260
 the weight transfer that the front pro 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.590
 it is 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.930
 the experience and experience with cavaco deus 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.859
 child in real work 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.549
 against those of ox a cattle of milk and 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:49.419
 returning all by which now six 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:51.939
 modules and duration of 640 hours the course 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.969
 goes the basics in dealing with the walker 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.060
 until the formation of a manager of areas 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:01.479
 passing through the activities of the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.250
 started by another since 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.569
 at the time he is born with the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.540
 navel cure 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.329
 then make his header after the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:16.470
 gift is later in the dressage make the part of the 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:21.039
 riding after the training that is 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.310
 refine the work of this horse to 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.990
 so take the parents and bring them to the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.500
 track 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.259
 this is module 3 teaches how to tame the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.310
 animals in the pet owner monelli parelli 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.099
 roberts 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.030
 the gentle dressage without any aggression to the 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.520
 animal 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.199
 landmarks wrote down everything had never 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.250
 opportunity I never had opportunity to have 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.900
 done a course is to specialize and I think 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.069
 important this initiative of the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.190
 together with the association 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.389
 cultural crisis is an opportunity 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.160
 is holding the man's hand if 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.319
 qualify and professionalize 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.270
 I think our horse evolved from mothers 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:01.690
 with a manpower can not be behind 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.250
 of the sea is the only woman of course and knows 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.250
 Very well, whatever. 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.530
 I want to move on because God 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:13.780
 little longer move with the horse and that 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.080
 course for me will be very good 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.680
 last year the owner of the haras 2a 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.490
 gave space for the practical classes 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.560
 that year he repeated the offer and more 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.409
 decided to take the course will not 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.280
 expected to have such a good result if 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:36.520
 we think he knows horses and that the 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.039
 We know genetics of my father 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.930
 I wanted more time in the party. 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.440
 genetics we know you a little more 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.389
 in theory, in practice, my 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.539
 I 'm very impressed, I think 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:52.990
 very help me then a black car that 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:54.759
 which teaches that the first thing I 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.099
 I do not want to correct a horse I want 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:02.919
 teach a horse that you wait part 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:05.500
 of the body so that the course is good only 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.930
 I'm doing also identifying 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.419
 As someone in life said you want. 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.969
 working with new Tobago calm so I 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.669
 I searched for work even the years they 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.699
 speak that failed to catch the world 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.880
 science and qualifying the goal is 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.880
 continue until tomorrow
