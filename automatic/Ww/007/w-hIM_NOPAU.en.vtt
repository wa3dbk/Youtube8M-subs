number one we already got relic new in

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.850 
number one we already got relic new in
but<00:04:01.150> i'll<00:04:01.840> see<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.110> can<00:04:02.200> maybe<00:04:02.320> get<00:04:02.470> everything

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
but i'll see we can maybe get everything

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.229 
but i'll see we can maybe get everything
the<00:04:02.980> first<00:04:03.220> try<00:04:03.370> probably<00:04:03.880> won't<00:04:03.940> we're<00:04:04.120> never

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
the first try probably won't we're never

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.900 
the first try probably won't we're never

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
almost 30,000 yeah that's pretty much it
guys<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:30.280> increase<00:04:30.610> your<00:04:30.760> strength<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.480> then

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
guys you increase your strength and then

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.530 
guys you increase your strength and then
you<00:04:32.620> do<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.220> you're<00:04:33.460> wondering<00:04:33.850> how

of people i'm going to show you this
right<00:04:41.930> now<00:04:41.960> okay<00:04:42.650> let's<00:04:43.370> wait<00:04:43.520> for<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.669> proc

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
right now okay let's wait for the proc

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.930 
right now okay let's wait for the proc
to<00:04:44.030> come<00:04:44.180> up<00:04:44.330> oh<00:04:44.919> by<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:45.949> way<00:04:46.069> can<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.699> machine

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
to come up oh by the way can the machine

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.320 
to come up oh by the way can the machine
seems<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.300> proc<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.630> lot<00:04:48.050> with<00:04:48.289> this<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:49.330> don't

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
know why the code machine he seems to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.260 
know why the code machine he seems to
