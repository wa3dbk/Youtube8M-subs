00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
out for field goal and we'll just get

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
real clubs it's going to be you know a

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
real clubs it's going to be you know a
concept<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.649> think's<00:02:06.860> going<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.040> be

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
concept that I think's going to be

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.770 
concept that I think's going to be
around<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.490> lot<00:02:07.580> longer<00:02:13.600> yeah<00:02:14.600> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
around for a lot longer yeah the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.870 
around for a lot longer yeah the
advantage<00:02:15.200> for<00:02:15.410> us<00:02:15.440> he's<00:02:16.040> probably<00:02:16.280> got<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.580> lot

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
advantage for us he's probably got a lot

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.880 
advantage for us he's probably got a lot
of<00:02:16.910> young<00:02:17.090> folks<00:02:17.270> going<00:02:17.600> over<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.020> are<00:02:18.200> on

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
of young folks going over that are on

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.890 
of young folks going over that are on
the<00:02:19.100> defensive<00:02:19.550> side<00:02:19.940> probably<00:02:20.450> stay<00:02:20.600> away

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
the defensive side probably stay away

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.120 
the defensive side probably stay away
Willie<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.070> big<00:02:22.250> blacks<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.700> stuff
