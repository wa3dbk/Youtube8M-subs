00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
what this is is that the game-mode

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.270

demolition<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.810> was<00:03:25.989> exactly<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:26.800> this

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
demolition it was exactly like this

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.160 
demolition it was exactly like this
except<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.180> fact<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.420> sabotage<00:03:28.930> has<00:03:29.140> a

except for the fact that sabotage has a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.170 
except for the fact that sabotage has a
respawn<00:03:29.590> timer<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.220> when<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.550> die<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.820> have

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
respawn timer so when you die you have

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.000 
respawn timer so when you die you have
to<00:03:31.360> wait<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> certain<00:03:31.930> uh<00:03:32.080> couple<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.680> seconds

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
to wait a certain uh couple of seconds

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.280 
to wait a certain uh couple of seconds
to<00:03:33.070> spawn<00:03:33.310> that's<00:03:33.550> why<00:03:33.700> I'm<00:03:34.000> keep<00:03:34.900> cutting<00:03:35.200> out

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
to spawn that's why I'm keep cutting out

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.080 
to spawn that's why I'm keep cutting out
spots<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.220> showing<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.550> every<00:03:36.820> kill<00:03:37.060> I

you<00:03:50.680> guys<00:03:50.770> me<00:03:51.160> sitting<00:03:51.459> here<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.670> de-essing<00:03:52.150> for

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
you guys me sitting here a de-essing for

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.699 
you guys me sitting here a de-essing for
like<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.780> think<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:53.050> was<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.290> ten<00:03:53.560> minute

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
like I think this was like a ten minute

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.930 
like I think this was like a ten minute
game<00:03:53.980> player<00:03:54.280> like<00:03:54.490> a<00:03:54.520> twelve<00:03:54.790> minute

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
game player like a twelve minute

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.210 
game player like a twelve minute
gameplay<00:03:55.240> so<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.870> thought<00:03:56.709> I'd<00:03:56.800> just<00:03:56.920> cut<00:03:57.130> it

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
gameplay so I thought I'd just cut it

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.810 
gameplay so I thought I'd just cut it
out<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.340> little<00:03:57.670> portion<00:03:58.180> of<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.620> yeah<00:04:00.220> I'm

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
out a little portion of it so yeah I'm

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.250 
out a little portion of it so yeah I'm
not<00:04:01.000> quite<00:04:01.209> sure<00:04:01.240> where<00:04:01.570> all<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.780> other<00:04:01.900> spots

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
not quite sure where all the other spots

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.890 
not quite sure where all the other spots
are<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.709> map<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.300> spawn<00:04:04.300> trap<00:04:04.540> because<00:04:04.720> I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
are in the map this spawn trap because I

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.660 
are in the map this spawn trap because I
haven't<00:04:05.230> really<00:04:05.530> done<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:05.920> before<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.550> is

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
haven't really done this before this is

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.940 
haven't really done this before this is
the<00:04:06.880> only<00:04:07.060> spot<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.600> know<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.770> is

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
the only spot that I know of so this is

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.890

right here in front of me um I have a

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.800 
right here in front of me um I have a
feeling<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.180> know<00:04:16.299> some<00:04:16.480> people<00:04:16.630> are<00:04:16.750> gonna

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
feeling you know some people are gonna

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.569 
feeling you know some people are gonna
be<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.079> well<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.709> why<00:04:17.829> your<00:04:17.980> KD<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.400> so

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
high I just have a feeling that there's

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.820 
high I just have a feeling that there's
someone<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.519> says<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.410> it's<00:04:23.410> not<00:04:23.560> true

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
someone that says that and it's not true

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.130 
someone that says that and it's not true
I've<00:04:24.220> only<00:04:24.520> done<00:04:24.730> this<00:04:24.880> twice<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.660> until

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
I've only done this twice and until

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.780 
I've only done this twice and until
yesterday<00:04:26.290> my<00:04:26.830> KD<00:04:27.070> barely<00:04:27.550> went<00:04:27.700> up

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
yesterday my KD barely went up

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.190 
yesterday my KD barely went up
considering<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.360> have<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.570> many<00:04:28.660> kills<00:04:28.990> and

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
considering I have so many kills and

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.320 
considering I have so many kills and

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
normally play I just want to really

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.530

you know I don't do this on the regular

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.740 
you know I don't do this on the regular
basis<00:04:36.490> because<00:04:36.760> some<00:04:37.000> people<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.419> be<00:04:37.510> kind<00:04:37.690> of

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
the start so they have a chain

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.360 
the start so they have a chain
ants<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:56.050> know<00:05:56.170> fight<00:05:56.500> out<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:56.950> break<00:05:57.190> it
