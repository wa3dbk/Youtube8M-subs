00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
thing and then to do it so normally you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
putting in chin you put the item in here
and<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.290> chant<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650

enchantment protection one so then like

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.569 
enchantment protection one so then like

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
it wouldn't chance it so it chant chance

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
it wouldn't chance it so it chant chance
it<00:02:03.719> makes<00:02:03.840> us<00:02:03.960> tick<00:02:04.140> protection<00:02:04.680> even<00:02:05.159> though

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it makes us tick protection even though

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
it makes us tick protection even though
items<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.000> would<00:02:06.270> never<00:02:06.390> break<00:02:06.750> but

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
items like this would never break but

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.190 
items like this would never break but
but<00:02:07.860> still<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.190> nice<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.580> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.879> cold

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
but still it's nice it's kind of cold

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.530 
but still it's nice it's kind of cold
so<00:02:09.739> what<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:10.039> thinking<00:02:10.150> was<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.209> what

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
so what I was thinking was that what

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.030 
so what I was thinking was that what
would<00:02:11.629> be<00:02:11.750> cool<00:02:11.959> we'll<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.349> i'll<00:02:12.440> get<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.860> cup

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
would be cool we'll see i'll get a cup

would be cool we'll see i'll get a cup
books<00:02:13.250> out<00:02:13.660> what<00:02:14.660> would<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.840> cool<00:02:15.050> though<00:02:15.200> is

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
books out what would be cool though is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.809 
books out what would be cool though is
it<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.830> could<00:02:16.010> for<00:02:16.340> what<00:02:16.519> i<00:02:16.550> was<00:02:16.700> doing

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
it like you could for what i was doing

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.100 
it like you could for what i was doing
for<00:02:16.940> like<00:02:17.030> her<00:02:17.180> ears<00:02:17.390> map<00:02:17.540> or<00:02:17.690> something<00:02:17.810> like

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.050 
tip at the end and then whenever you hit
somebody<00:02:21.650> let's<00:02:22.010> say<00:02:22.129> with<00:02:22.310> fire<00:02:22.519> aspect<00:02:22.849> you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
somebody let's say with fire aspect you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.820 
somebody let's say with fire aspect you
set<00:02:23.239> them<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.390> fire<00:02:23.629> but<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.230> was<00:02:24.349> cool<00:02:24.560> and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
set them on fire but that was cool and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.949 
set them on fire but that was cool and
then<00:02:25.519> you<00:02:25.940> kick<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.180> out<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.330> feathers<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.870> can

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
then you kick it out to feathers you can

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.290 
then you kick it out to feathers you can
add<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.260> blaze<00:02:27.800> rods<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.489> can<00:02:28.610> even<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.120> got

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
add to blaze rods you can even I got

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.670 
add to blaze rods you can even I got
think<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.690> could<00:02:29.840> even<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.319> books

do this so he will go back to creative
mode<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.650> then<00:03:19.459> we'll<00:03:19.819> be<00:03:20.000> able<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> do<00:03:20.329> it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
that's hopefully we'll be able to do it

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
there you go look at that see so I

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.979 
there you go look at that see so I
thought<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.310> was<00:03:25.430> got<00:03:25.549> interesting<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.750> like<00:03:26.900> I

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
thought I was got interesting so like I

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.150 
thought I was got interesting so like I
actually<00:03:27.109> said<00:03:27.380> in<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.500> very<00:03:27.590> beginning<00:03:27.739> this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
actually said in the very beginning this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.129 
actually said in the very beginning this
is<00:03:28.280> all<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.400> my<00:03:28.519> speculation<00:03:29.389> like<00:03:29.930> there's

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
is all in my speculation like there's

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.660 
is all in my speculation like there's
this<00:03:30.290> element<00:03:30.440> confirmed<00:03:31.069> or<00:03:31.220> anything<00:03:31.519> i'm

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
this element confirmed or anything i'm

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.059 
this element confirmed or anything i'm
suing<00:03:32.329> this<00:03:32.510> would<00:03:32.690> be<00:03:32.810> added<00:03:33.139> in<00:03:33.260> hopefully<00:03:34.040> i

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
suing this would be added in hopefully i

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.920 
suing this would be added in hopefully i
mean<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:34.519> can<00:03:34.670> always<00:03:34.790> hope<00:03:35.090> yeah<00:03:35.720> i<00:03:35.750> thought

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
mean we can always hope yeah i thought

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.030
