00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.689
 hello welcome to the channel and in the video 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.240
 today I have prepared the next day 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.070
 same how to make these jewel bracelets the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.750
 I've seen a lot this summer the truth 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.580
 is that I love how they look you see me 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.710
 I made the day and I loved the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.960
 result are super simple and in ten 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:27.190
 minutes you can do the 23 the truth is 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:29.740
 it is very easy what materials you are going to 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.439
 need they are called jewel bracelets because 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.899
 They mainly carry these stones 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.199
 set in crystal, remember that 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.179
 in Gasteiz should have holes drills 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.800
 to be able to clog the laces 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.390
 nice is also able to combine 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.429
 different colors of stone with 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.589
 different colors of cord and then 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.569
 I will also need some quotes that 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.069
 they will go next to the stones to 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.319
 keep us from moving and stay 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.960
 in the center you will eventually need 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.690
 terminals for bracelets that are going to be 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.299
 terminals in the form of tube rings and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.039
 carabiners then you will need glue 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.960
 to glue the terminals to your 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.190
 cord and the typical tools of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.170
 these jewelry 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.750
 They must be well attached to the wrist 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.580
 because the part of the center carry the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.560
 worn stone can weigh a little 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.450
 more and we can be turned around 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.430
 then some recommendations that I 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.950
 you give very well of the size of yours 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.360
 doll and fits a lot like I have 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 done with these, as you can see, I have no leftovers 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 nothing but I'm pretty tight 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.400
 good and more water terminal you have already 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.280
 seen that the bracelets are super easy 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.230
 to do two tips only so that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.300
 make these bracelets easier 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.760
 the first you have to cut the ends 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.490
 of the cord either leather or cotton or what 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.290
 that is someone never straight because that's how 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.910
 it's going to be much harder to introduce them 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.550
 in the tube terminals and cut them and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.380
 salvi is going to be much easier and 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.030
 then while you are entering a 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.800
 tube terminal what you have to do 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.900
 is to rotate it as if it were a 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.700
 screw because once we put it 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.680
 the glue costs a little bit then 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.270
 you are simply rotating the terminal 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 as if it were a screw and you'll see 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.950
 how easy in one last thing very 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.990
 important if you buy the pieces by 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.780
 separate these glass bonds with 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.150
 dressmaking remember that the drills 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.980
 by default they are not prepared for 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.630
 introduce a half millimeter cord 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.970
 but they are smaller 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.610
 then you can do two things or 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.470
 with a metal boundary you can do the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.360
 drills a little larger or the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.670
 second option is not to complicate anything 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.560
 and you can buy the kit with all the 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.720
 materials where these pieces are already coming 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.430
 with its specifically prepared fittings 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.810
 for the laces that come in the kit 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.550
 well I hope you liked this
