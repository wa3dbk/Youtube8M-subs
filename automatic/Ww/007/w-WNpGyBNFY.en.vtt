00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends so today I 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.430
 are you going to talk about some 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.420
 something that was asked of me because 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.529
 it is true that I tend in all 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.000
 videos in fact that I'm going to you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.099
 talk about positive things 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.509
 about the sleeve is 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.420
 actually when we lost 40 kilos 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.240
 in six months we are ashamed is that of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.130
 positive but unfortunately between 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 quotation marks there is not only positive 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.189
 in this operation so I had done 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.199
 the 10 things that changed after my 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 operation and in response to that I'm going 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 you make a month of a coup today 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.359
 the things not they changed the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 ten months after the operation 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.260
 so for me the the first thing in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.700
 fact which is the most negative is who 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.780
 who is worth 50 times to him all the others 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.180
 all the other points of view you 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 evoke it's water management 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.610
 today and since almost 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 does the water management that's 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 particular which one can drink when 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 I'm thirsty I 'm drinking this is the waltz if 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.289
 but we can not drink 45 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.360
 minutes before eating good of course in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.129
 eating the parish to drink and 45 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 minutes after eating why because 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 our stomach makes 200 mg l pretty much 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 if you ask if you drink before you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.699
 you fill it with the shot you eat 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.870
 no and after you almost have to have 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.510
 problems of malnutrition 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.500
 if you drink at the same time as says my 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.729
 god but it's exactly the same thing 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.650
 so you'll quickly stop 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 to eat and it's the same for the after 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.509
 eat it does not fit and I have 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.130
 tempted like everyone else and that made me 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.950
 minute species dumping or bleach 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.400
 and sweat it was the disaster that the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.229
 water management it's the ultra frustrating 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.759
 not to be able to see while eating and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.820
 not being able to see limits when we 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.979
 so that's it that was my first 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.570
 point the second point the sparkling water and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.040
 the coke all that is finally for me 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 in fact despite all that we could say 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.939
 in the press these video notes for 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.490
 me it is forbidden I had actually 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.780
 a lot of things at the medical level I 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.100
 the impression anyway that it told me 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.560
 there you are my stomach I do not want to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.290
 take risks I too much 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.040
 scared and I actually took quite 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.280
 of risks to do this operation 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.829
 I do not want that it's so hot 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.899
 no, I will not take gas or 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.280
 coke in there anyway in the same 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.409
 doses than what I took before for 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.990
 the sparkling water I think I was running in 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.430
 resume but in small doses but j for 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.710
 the moment I'm really scared so 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.000
 I do not take it and for the Coke I think 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.110
 that I banned myself for life because 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.030
 I was too much to believe 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.290
 this is the second point because it 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.720
 was still a pleasure 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.940
 I think about this summer or when it does 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.440
 super hot and you want to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.280
 do you for example a little drink to 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.780
 springs to bind for italians 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.830
 know what it is it's sparkling so 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.660
 born tell I could not take it to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.250
 ussel it's a little frustrating but good 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.010
 it does not matter but it's part of it 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.480
 still negative points third 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.620
 times in the same in the same lineage 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.970
 it's chewing gum so it's the same 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.780
 they are part of my protocol there 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.280
 was forbidden 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.270
 so it remains forbidden that a little point 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.150
 because that's not what I miss 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.080
 more in the fourth pea too 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.610
 because that's not what's missing 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.870
 plus it was not an addict but it 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.489
 something remains that I can not 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.040
 today to approach with serenity 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.420
 it's alcohol I did not take except 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.790
 soak your lips for New Year's Day 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.390
 and christmas so champagne I did not take 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.920
 alcohol is not a lack it's just 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.150
 that when we have an audience often we are 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.580
 ask the question how come that 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.500
 I do not take a glass of wine 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.610
 I 'm not taking it, it's not forbidden 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.290
 it's just that you have to learn all 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.530
 small entities for those who took it 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.790
 before then I do not know why I had it 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.560
 put in my list 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.989
 quit smoking I was doing more 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 since May 2009 but in any case it 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.590
 was one of the things I put in 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.330
 the negative but it's still positive 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.810
 to stop smoking but for those who 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.570
 smoking 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.950
 me my surgeon would have actually refused 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.549
 that I do my operation if I had 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.290
 intend to continue killing so here you go 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.040
 what they honestly smoke this not a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.040
 good idea to continue 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.070
 fifth point that is not the least 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.180
 which could at the same point actually that 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.489
 the first point 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.000
 but still it's not not everything 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.530
 time actually breaks it and 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.280
 irritability 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.170
 why because when you are 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.810
 tired necessarily you have the nerves to 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.409
 alive and I had them 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.310
 especially the first two months so 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.680
 november december january 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.030
 okay go three months way november 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.099
 january january I had periods where 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.329
 I was very much angry thank you to 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.889
 my husband i will make a video page 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.189
 special on my husband and my two 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.510
 special on the the couple and the support 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.489
 that you must have actually just after 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.259
 Pascal honestly hat to him he me 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.060
 supported all this time there but 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.889
 you are inevitably tired you are 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.380
 you lose a lot of weight and you 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.009
 are tired annuities so is very 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.599
 irritable 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.090
 take the meeting because 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:31.930
 frankly you're going to be pretty 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.490
 irritable sixth point which for me 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.060
 in no long time this will be a point 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.710
 positive 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.240
 the change of frags why negative 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.229
 because you purify yourself to put yourself 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.780
 I have my mother who is sewing is 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.000
 luckily she does not resume everything but 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.520
 nothing is okay so I 'm still putting my 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.530
 art clothes in May so frankly 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.389
 was doing 54 I have to do the 48 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.520
 today there is as one who goes so 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.349
 we will have to buy everything so 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.979
 plan a budget you need everything 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.750
 buy 20 of the pants to the dress to 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.419
 shoes everything where there is nothing 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.340
 who will you say it I think so 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.960
 at the skin level so I'm doing 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.669
 full of care because it is so 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.400
 it's seventh it's very dry 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.770
 so I have a mixed skin trend 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.479
 acne to see grace but actually with 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.240
 this operation I actually had the 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.300
 pretty dry skin the whole body it's 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.710
 so I do but full of products 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.560
 doping a negative point but it was 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.020
 part of the points still eighth 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.699
 point then negative and positive this is the 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.590
 change of taste I say plenty of 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.050
 Once I was there was born to brown the meat 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.300
 today I like it much less for 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.590
 tonight actually I actually planned a 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 clipboard fish because frankly 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.770
 that's what thrills me the most fish 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.530
 so 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.870
 you will change bags I think 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.819
 that I'm not the sum actually having 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.759
 had this type of phenomenon change of 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.190
 group for lüthi 9th point the 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.780
 sociability the family meals go 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.400
 at the restaurant it makes a little bit of 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.960
 points in negative quotation marks at 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.190
 departure because frankly I 'm 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.810
 always call back my first 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.560
 restaurant with my husband I think it was 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.530
 in the month of December 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.319
 so a month and a half after I almost 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.849
 eat nothing the meal one's father 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.909
 main but I saw that my main 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.409
 and cost 25 euros and I have almost nothing 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.729
 to eat it's a bit frustrating actually 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.560
 so when you make big meals 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.330
 it's a bit special about the funds in 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.340
 do I do I because I'm like 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.599
 I want to please so I 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.190
 eat I eat it well I'm sick 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.199
 especially in my parents' home 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.539
 she wants to please me so she 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.639
 eat and then I want to eat 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.099
 again this noon I took the mouth is 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.979
 too much so that's the side a little bit more 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.630
 difficult to manage but we learn a little 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.270
 every two days so we learn the 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.099
 quantities that we can eat and that's it 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.560
 going to go it's part of things in 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.330
 everything is going to have to really change the 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.550
 look at others since you 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.139
 dress up they've been used to seeing you 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.729
 eat a lot and then suddenly you 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.240
 can eat a lot less so 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.759
 it's necessarily a bit strange here 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.779
 and last point the skin then following 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.550
 a big weight loss you go 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.050
 see the fact that your skin is at risk 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.460
 to be a little more flaccid to 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.810
 places so for now me I the 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.699
 see at the level of the arms but it's not 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.380
 blatant at all so I think I have 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:07.090
 lucky but 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.230
 it's not going to last a hundred and fifty thousand years 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.850
 so I think the post is going to have to 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.800
 do things I'll talk to you at 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.330
 over time in any case these are the 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.400
 ten points that relates to the points 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.480
 negatives after a slip you can 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.010
 actually see that it's not points 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.810
 ultra negative but it was still necessary 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.430
 that I talked about it anyway I 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.590
 always been sincere with you it's 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:27.430
 I tend to be optimistic when 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.480
 even so are points that who do not 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.490
 does not prevent me from saying that I regret 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.210
 really not at all this operation and 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:36.070
 that if ever in fact we asked them to 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.750
 sign to close the eyes I will go 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.280
 closed but really with my eyes closed 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.480
 even wonder why I was not leaving 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.400
 that I even wonder I did not know 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.060
 if it had been proposed to me ten years ago 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.560
 but happiness to see is to be able to do 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.090
 my pregnancies that I lived and 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.740
 however that I had before that would have 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.660
 been top to actually do with his 40 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.160
 kg of me that I can really you 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.680
 to say it was really cool what 

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.510
 here is the source that I can tell you 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.860
 in fact on the ten points between 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.640
 negative quotation marks of the sleeve but 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.470
 frankly it's still worth it 

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.150
 I wish everyone a good evening and 

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.150
 a good weekend in Bahrain
