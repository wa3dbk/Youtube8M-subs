on<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.210> machine<00:04:48.110> put<00:04:49.110> my<00:04:49.229> presser<00:04:49.500> foot<00:04:49.860> down

on the machine put my presser foot down
and<00:04:51.360> I'm<00:04:51.539> just<00:04:51.690> gonna<00:04:51.810> go<00:04:52.080> back<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.470> forth

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
and I'm just gonna go back and forth

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.740 
and I'm just gonna go back and forth
over<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:54.479> elastic<00:04:56.570> at<00:04:57.570> least<00:04:57.930> three<00:04:58.320> times

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
over the elastic at least three times

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.300 
over the elastic at least three times
and<00:05:00.750> I'll<00:05:00.900> probably<00:05:01.169> move<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.740> around<00:05:01.889> and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and I'll probably move it around and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.980 
and I'll probably move it around and
I'll<00:05:02.370> show<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.759> so<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.539> press<00:05:03.750> the

reverse button go back you want to do
this<00:05:08.729> several<00:05:09.570> times<00:05:09.860> minimum<00:05:10.860> because

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
this several times minimum because

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.430 
this several times minimum because
there's<00:05:12.000> gonna<00:05:12.120> be<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> lot<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.599> stress<00:05:12.960> on<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
there's gonna be a lot of stress on the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.830 
there's gonna be a lot of stress on the
elastic<00:05:14.009> as<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.400> put<00:05:14.880> these<00:05:15.060> pants<00:05:15.360> on<00:05:15.599> and

elastic as you put these pants on and
off<00:05:17.599> and<00:05:18.599> this<00:05:19.409> will<00:05:19.620> make<00:05:19.770> sure<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.310> it

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
off and this will make sure that it

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.460 
off and this will make sure that it
doesn't<00:05:20.669> come<00:05:21.320> apart<00:05:23.030> all<00:05:24.030> right<00:05:24.470> exactly

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
doesn't come apart all right exactly

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.350 
doesn't come apart all right exactly
perfect<00:05:25.830> but<00:05:25.979> lift<00:05:26.639> that<00:05:26.759> up<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.180> I'm<00:05:27.270> gonna

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
perfect but lift that up and I'm gonna

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.730 
perfect but lift that up and I'm gonna
move<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.840> over<00:05:28.669> right<00:05:29.669> here

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.470 

and<00:05:34.700> I'm<00:05:34.820> careful<00:05:35.210> that<00:05:35.570> I'm<00:05:35.690> not<00:05:36.100> touching

any of the fabric of the pajama pants

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.650 
any of the fabric of the pajama pants
because<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.580> don't<00:05:40.760> want<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:41.000> attach<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.270> that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
because I don't want to attach it that

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.240 
because I don't want to attach it that
way<00:05:44.350> you<00:05:45.350> know<00:05:45.440> I'll<00:05:45.500> do<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:45.710> one<00:05:45.890> more<00:05:45.950> time

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
way you know I'll do it one more time

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:53.800 
way you know I'll do it one more time
because<00:05:48.250> eight<00:05:49.250> is<00:05:49.460> enough<00:05:49.760> right

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.909 

all<00:05:54.810> right<00:05:54.960> no<00:05:56.300> move<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.570> you<00:05:58.320> just<00:05:58.560> deserves

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
all right no move that you just deserves

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.529 
all right no move that you just deserves
trim<00:06:01.919> your<00:06:02.070> threads<00:06:03.050> and<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:05.220> don't<00:06:06.060> have<00:06:06.300> too

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
trim your threads and I don't have too

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.830 
trim your threads and I don't have too
much<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:06.750> a<00:06:07.020> tail<00:06:07.229> I<00:06:07.590> can<00:06:08.580> trim<00:06:08.880> that<00:06:08.910> off<00:06:09.150> a

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
much of a tail I can trim that off a

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.159 
much of a tail I can trim that off a
little<00:06:10.229> bit<00:06:10.590> closer<00:06:11.240> trim<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.419> off<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:12.960> that

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
little bit closer trim that off so that

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.629 
little bit closer trim that off so that
there's<00:06:13.350> not<00:06:13.560> a<00:06:13.620> lot<00:06:13.710> of<00:06:13.949> bulk<00:06:14.160> there<00:06:14.400> because

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
there's not a lot of bulk there because

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.060 
there's not a lot of bulk there because
that<00:06:14.789> could<00:06:15.000> rub<00:06:15.660> you<00:06:15.900> as<00:06:16.320> you<00:06:16.470> wear<00:06:16.650> them<00:06:16.680> and

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
that could rub you as you wear them and

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.200 
that could rub you as you wear them and
then<00:06:17.160> just<00:06:17.370> pop<00:06:17.580> it<00:06:17.789> pop<00:06:18.320> it<00:06:19.320> into<00:06:19.500> place<00:06:20.210> okay

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
then just pop it pop it into place okay

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.950 
then just pop it pop it into place okay
and<00:06:22.400> again<00:06:23.400> you<00:06:23.820> might<00:06:23.970> want<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.300> just<00:06:24.509> verify

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
and again you might want to just verify

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.750 
and again you might want to just verify
that<00:06:25.440> you<00:06:25.590> haven't<00:06:25.889> twisted<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.340> because<00:06:26.580> it's

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
that you haven't twisted it because it's

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.719 
that you haven't twisted it because it's
still<00:06:26.970> not<00:06:27.090> too<00:06:27.330> late<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.570> fix<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:28.169> if<00:06:29.160> you<00:06:29.520> have

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729
