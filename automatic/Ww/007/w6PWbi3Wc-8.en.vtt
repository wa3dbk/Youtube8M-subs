00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
possible but you know I felt like his

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.539 
possible but you know I felt like his
desire<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.690> extremely<00:00:57.690> high<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.979> started

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
desire was extremely high so I started

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.739 
desire was extremely high so I started
to<00:00:59.699> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> research<00:01:00.179> the<00:01:00.329> chocolate

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
to kind of research the chocolate

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.299 
to kind of research the chocolate
industry<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.319> how<00:01:01.409> they<00:01:01.589> make<00:01:01.859> chocolate

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
industry and how they make chocolate

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.889 
industry and how they make chocolate
filled<00:01:02.429> fashionably<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.089> thought<00:01:03.359> why<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> want

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
filled fashionably I thought why I want

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.440 
filled fashionably I thought why I want
to<00:01:03.959> make<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> old-fashioned<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.450> put

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to make it the old-fashioned way and put

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
to make it the old-fashioned way and put
a<00:01:06.479> lot<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> love<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.440> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.619> humility<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a lot of love and a lot of humility and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
a lot of love and a lot of humility and
a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> honor<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.480> sacredness<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.410> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
a lot of honor and sacredness into it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
a lot of honor and sacredness into it
hence<00:01:10.920> sacred<00:01:11.310> chocolate<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.080> kind

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
hence sacred chocolate so we just kind

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
hence sacred chocolate so we just kind
of<00:01:13.380> started<00:01:13.740> playing<00:01:13.980> around<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.430> kitchen<00:01:14.610> at

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of started playing around the kitchen at

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.190 
of started playing around the kitchen at
first<00:01:15.120> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.480> one<00:01:15.600> thing<00:01:15.630> led<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> another

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
first and then one thing led to another

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.950 
first and then one thing led to another
and<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.800> have<00:01:16.980> a<00:01:17.010> chocolate<00:01:17.220> factory

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
and now we have a chocolate factory

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.750 
and now we have a chocolate factory
we've<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.620> i<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.010> spent<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> time

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
we've really i think spent a lot of time

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.870 
we've really i think spent a lot of time
studying<00:01:21.090> alchemy<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.640> sacredness<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
studying alchemy and the sacredness of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
studying alchemy and the sacredness of
metals<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.630> alchemical<00:01:25.290> metallic<00:01:25.830> part<00:01:26.100> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
metals the alchemical metallic part of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.330 
metals the alchemical metallic part of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the great alchemists of europe the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.920 
the great alchemists of europe the
ayurvedic<00:01:29.880> alchemist<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> Chinese

ayurvedic alchemist the Chinese

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
ayurvedic alchemist the Chinese
alchemist<00:01:31.350> we've<00:01:31.920> spent<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.280> tremendous

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
alchemist we've spent a tremendous

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
alchemist we've spent a tremendous
amount<00:01:33.120> of<00:01:33.360> time<00:01:33.540> studying<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.290> field<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
amount of time studying the field of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.900 
amount of time studying the field of
ormos<00:01:35.280> which<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.590> obviously<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:38.010> more

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
ormos which is obviously a more

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.300 
ormos which is obviously a more
conventional<00:01:39.750> modern-day<00:01:40.620> understanding<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
conventional modern-day understanding of

conventional modern-day understanding of
present-day<00:01:41.640> understanding<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.300> what<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.630> had

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
present-day understanding of what we had

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260 
present-day understanding of what we had
in<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.320> past<00:01:43.440> termed<00:01:43.770> alchemy<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.430> we're

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
in the past termed alchemy and we're

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.850 
in the past termed alchemy and we're
taking<00:01:45.660> all<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:46.320> knowledge<00:01:46.620> research<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
taking all that knowledge research and

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.040 
taking all that knowledge research and
inspiration<00:01:49.860> into<00:01:50.130> chocolate<00:01:51.090> making<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
inspiration into chocolate making now to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.800 
inspiration into chocolate making now to
really<00:01:52.620> create<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.159> chocolate<00:01:53.850> bar<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
really create the chocolate bar in the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.060 
really create the chocolate bar in the
way<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.080> was<00:01:55.230> supposed<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.620> created

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
way that was supposed to be created

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
way that was supposed to be created
which<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.880> delivery<00:01:57.300> vehicle<00:01:57.870> for<00:01:57.900> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
which is the delivery vehicle for the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.620 
which is the delivery vehicle for the
most<00:01:58.290> powerful<00:01:59.330> nutrients<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.450> most
