factory and the thing that strikes me

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
factory and the thing that strikes me
here<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> fact<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.380> liquid<00:01:31.860> cooled

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
here is the fact they are liquid cooled

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.660 
here is the fact they are liquid cooled
this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> second<00:01:34.380> bike<00:01:34.680> made<00:01:35.520> by

high<00:01:35.850> deficits<00:01:36.240> liquid-cooled<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.290> think

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
high deficits liquid-cooled I think

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.020 
high deficits liquid-cooled I think
they're<00:01:38.220> trying<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> make<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> transition

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
they're trying to make the transition

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.440

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
for a low end hi Devon I think these are

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.030 
for a low end hi Devon I think these are
going<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.450> priced<00:02:17.840> at<00:02:18.049> around<00:02:18.110> 6,000

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
going to be priced at around 6,000

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.509 
going to be priced at around 6,000
pounds<00:02:19.519> or<00:02:19.700> six<00:02:20.120> thousand<00:02:20.510> seven<00:02:20.810> hundred<00:02:20.840> US

dollars<00:02:24.129> to<00:02:25.129> be<00:02:25.250> honest<00:02:25.519> they<00:02:25.670> look<00:02:25.879> pretty

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
dollars to be honest they look pretty

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.690 
dollars to be honest they look pretty
cool<00:02:27.790> now<00:02:28.790> these<00:02:29.650> these<00:02:30.650> are<00:02:30.980> supposed<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.640> be

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
cool now these these are supposed to be

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.440 
cool now these these are supposed to be
quite<00:02:32.000> light<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.620> nimble<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.730> think<00:02:35.120> that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
quite light and nimble so I think that

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.470 
quite light and nimble so I think that
they<00:02:35.629> will<00:02:35.810> be<00:02:35.840> good<00:02:36.459> urban<00:02:37.459> bikes<00:02:37.700> which<00:02:38.180> are

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
they will be good urban bikes which are

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.599 
they will be good urban bikes which are
well<00:02:39.110> they<00:02:39.409> are<00:02:39.590> supposed<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.920> be<00:02:40.010> urban<00:02:40.190> bikes

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
well they are supposed to be urban bikes

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.270 
well they are supposed to be urban bikes
I<00:02:40.849> think<00:02:41.599> they<00:02:41.720> might<00:02:41.959> be<00:02:41.989> quite<00:02:42.409> good<00:02:42.620> at<00:02:42.769> you

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
I think they might be quite good at you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.309 
I think they might be quite good at you
