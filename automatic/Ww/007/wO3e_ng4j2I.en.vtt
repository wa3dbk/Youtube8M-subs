00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:15.601
 Costumes are good with mascots 

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:17.417
 I want a mascot character 

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.199
 I want a mascot character 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.068
 Because it is easy to make everyone's graffiti 

00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:29.791
 Animals or monsters or monsters you want to be in Harajuku 

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:31.889
 But if you talk with Franken 

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:34.313
 I'm glad if you 

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:37.193
 A wolf man or something 

00:00:37.193 --> 00:00:39.314
 A person who protects 

00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:41.203
 Safely in Harajuku 

00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:42.868
 That's good 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.326
 cute! crocodile? 

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:04.473
 Oh, I understand, Haraju 

00:01:04.177 --> 00:01:06.214
 so. Haraju 

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:07.667
 Harajuku station so yes 

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.094
 It feels like colorful Halloween 

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:38.960
 Thank you very much 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.320
 Mix these three 

00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:57.850
 I like the makeup of the color that pink and orange are mixed 

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:00.350
 I want to ask how to put in teak 

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.690
 Please 

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:16.890
 This way, from the line of the tear bag under the eyes 

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:23.670
 I see 

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:25.030
 Reverse triangle 

00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:27.840
 It's not round 

00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:38.120
 Lip is an orange gross 

00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:43.900
 It's easy to use because it doesn't have such a huge orange 

00:03:44.014 --> 00:03:45.460
 Lips cute 

00:03:45.082 --> 00:03:46.710
 thought 

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:52.220
 At the end, just in the middle 

00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:56.870
 I use orange 

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:15.630
 I think it would be nice if the wharf only had a little color and the face would be a bit irritating. 

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:16.930
 done! 

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.540
 it is complete 

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.820
 it is complete 

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:45.970
 It would be good if it was Yura character 

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:47.120
 Oh, the character is good 

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.490
 Good cat 

00:04:49.048 --> 00:04:50.460
 Cute loose 

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:53.560
 Oh, twin tail is good 

00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:56.380
 Twin tail is good 

00:04:57.102 --> 00:05:00.100
 Well, it's Manimal 

00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:03.920
 animal 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.750
 Is something like Seto-Chan good? 

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:12.600
 I wish I had a hairy thing 

00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:13.600
 Yeah, it's easy to make it 

00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:14.790
 cute 

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:19.730
 Oh, that's good! It's not cute 

00:05:20.414 --> 00:05:24.540
 Oh, that's fine! Yeah, good 

00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:32.900
 Well, I got a mascot character called HARACHAN. 

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:41.750
 Thank you very much 

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:45.700
