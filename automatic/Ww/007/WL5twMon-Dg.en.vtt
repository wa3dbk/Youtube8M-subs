without cell things for a bit and that's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.110 
without cell things for a bit and that's
simply<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.439> i<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:31.859> was<00:00:32.610> too<00:00:32.759> lazy<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
simply because i just was too lazy to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.959 
simply because i just was too lazy to
buy<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.719> bunch<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.110> toss<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.969> now

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
buy a bunch or toss them on now

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
buy a bunch or toss them on now

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
surprisingly i actually find the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.459 
surprisingly i actually find the
experience<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.070> great<00:00:38.989> at<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.140> minute<00:00:40.350> or

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
experience that great at my minute or

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.069

responds<00:00:40.829> i<00:00:40.920> could<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.270> 60<00:00:42.270> k<00:00:42.420> an<00:00:42.570> hour<00:00:42.719> which

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
responds i could get 60 k an hour which

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
responds i could get 60 k an hour which
you<00:00:43.559> could<00:00:43.680> probably<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:44.040> around<00:00:44.520> 70<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> 80

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you could probably get around 70 to 80

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
you could probably get around 70 to 80
here<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.719> hunting<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> properly<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> fastly

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
here with hunting it properly and fastly

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.060 
here with hunting it properly and fastly
but<00:00:48.410> little<00:00:49.410> 20<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.800> minimal<00:00:50.340> area<00:00:50.610> spells

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
but little 20 i have minimal area spells

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.889 
but little 20 i have minimal area spells
so<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.270> tough<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.750> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so if it's kind of tough like like I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
so if it's kind of tough like like I
thought<00:00:55.110> there's<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.350> lot<00:00:55.500> better<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
thought there's a lot better but it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
thought there's a lot better but it
could<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.550> mistaken<00:00:56.719> my<00:00:57.719> magical<00:00:58.109> will

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
could be mistaken my magical will

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.540 
could be mistaken my magical will
probably<00:00:58.500> plays<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> part<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> now

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
probably plays a part in this and now

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.470 
probably plays a part in this and now
you'll<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> don't<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.329> mapped

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
you'll see I don't have it all mapped

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
you'll see I don't have it all mapped
out<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.050> I'll<00:01:01.530> probably<00:01:01.680> show<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.280> five<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
out but I'll probably show about five to
ten<00:01:03.510> minutes<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.290> people<00:01:04.680> know
