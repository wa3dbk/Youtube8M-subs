 Further these places dirt 3 of the first 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.699
 part came out in 2007 and quickly became 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.120
 popular then came the second part of 2000 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:09.280
 nines and 3 2011 in general the game is very 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:12.010
 good to collect costs in second place 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.380
 gran turismo 6 don't know there are games in 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.130
 parts of the neck you wrote only the sixth 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.100
 part 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.530
 she came out in 2013 the newest of 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 everyone in this top is really cool and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 just watch drift 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.790
 and in the first place nps namely and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.880
 serial grown i-shift 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.430
 ultron the first part came out in 2003 and 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.550
 became one of the best games immediately through 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.950
 the year was released the second part of 2004 was still 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.200
 a popular open world appeared and yet 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.600
 a lot of things to drift there 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.900
 separate cards at home are not their people 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.240
 who did not play this game and shift 13 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.630
 on the score down for speed came out first 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.880
 part of 2009 and as always turned out 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.369
 good game the second part of the shift came out in 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.800
 2011, she was also loved by the physics of the game 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.350
 Drift mode is different from the physics of the game 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.280
 passing the usual background complicates 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.280
 walkthrough 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.200
 Of course there are many other cool ones 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.180
 exactly drift racing but you guys chose 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.790
