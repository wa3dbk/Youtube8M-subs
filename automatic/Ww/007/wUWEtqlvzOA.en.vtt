cover from the guys on the ridge there
and<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.580> also<00:00:26.730> gives<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> little<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.539> of

and it also gives you a little bit of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
and it also gives you a little bit of
cover<00:00:27.810> from<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> top<00:00:28.349> window<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.920> The

Boathouse

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
Boathouse
moving<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> beef<00:00:30.869> leg<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
moving on to the beef leg this is one of

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.440 
moving on to the beef leg this is one of
the<00:00:31.800> most<00:00:31.980> difficult<00:00:32.160> flags<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.910> capture<00:00:33.270> in

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the most difficult flags to capture in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
the most difficult flags to capture in
the<00:00:33.600> game<00:00:33.809> sometimes<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.800> such<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the game sometimes because it's such a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
the game sometimes because it's such a
tight<00:00:35.430> area<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:36.660> easy<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> get

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
tight area and it's really easy to get

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
tight area and it's really easy to get
nated<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.800> stunned<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.550> you're<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.030> beef

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
nated or stunned when you're in the beef

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.990 
nated or stunned when you're in the beef
leg<00:00:39.420> area<00:00:40.129> what<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.550> most<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
leg area what I like to do most of the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.639 
leg area what I like to do most of the
time<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.390> basically<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:43.079> stand<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
time is basically just stand up and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
time is basically just stand up and
fight<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.850> want<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> say<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.390> feet

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
fight so I just want to say all my feet

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.750 
fight so I just want to say all my feet
and<00:00:45.870> mobile<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.890> make<00:00:47.489> sure<00:00:47.640> I'm

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and mobile and just make sure I'm

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130 
and mobile and just make sure I'm
looking<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> direction<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> enemy

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
looking in the direction that the enemy

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.080 
looking in the direction that the enemy
should<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.379> coming<00:00:49.649> from<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> try<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.879> fight

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
should be coming from and try and fight

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
should be coming from and try and fight
it<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.379> times<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> just

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
it out and a lot of times I like to just

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
it out and a lot of times I like to just
pop<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.789> take<00:00:54.030> them<00:00:54.120> by<00:00:54.270> surprise<00:00:54.300> but

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
pop out and take them by surprise but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
pop out and take them by surprise but
another<00:00:55.230> option<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> jump<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.219> top<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> this

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
another option is to jump on top of this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
another option is to jump on top of this
barrel<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.440> usually<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
barrel here and usually that's not the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
barrel here and usually that's not the
first<00:00:59.219> place<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.550> people<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> might

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
first place that people look so it might

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
first place that people look so it might
give<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> split-second<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
give you just that split-second of

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
give you just that split-second of
advantage<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> need<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.870> win<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
advantage that you need to win that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.870 
advantage that you need to win that
gunfight<00:01:04.830> against<00:01:05.070> somebody<00:01:05.430> coming<00:01:05.729> around

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
gunfight against somebody coming around

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.780 
gunfight against somebody coming around
the<00:01:06.030> corner<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.600> defend<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.409> beef<00:01:07.560> leg<00:01:07.799> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the corner to defend the beef leg so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.520 
the corner to defend the beef leg so
finally<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> SI<00:01:09.540> flag<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.290> one's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
finally for the SI flag this one's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
finally for the SI flag this one's
pretty<00:01:10.770> straightforward<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.580> open<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.060> like

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
pretty straightforward and open I like

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.700 
pretty straightforward and open I like
to<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.570> basically<00:01:12.930> capture<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to just basically capture it right

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.530 
to just basically capture it right
behind<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> ridge<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> nobody<00:01:15.390> can

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
behind the ridge here so that nobody can

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.450 
behind the ridge here so that nobody can
get<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> line<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> sight<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.259> me<00:01:16.530> from<00:01:16.799> way

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
get a line of sight on me from way

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
get a line of sight on me from way
across<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.000> map<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.990> where<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
across the map there or from where the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.219 
across the map there or from where the
logging<00:01:19.890> area<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.420> basically<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.630> forces<00:01:22.110> my

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
logging area is basically just forces my

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
logging area is basically just forces my
enemies<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> come<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.950> close<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.400> me<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> fight

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
enemies to come up close to me and fight

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
enemies to come up close to me and fight
that<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.869> another<00:01:25.170> option<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> jump

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that way but another option is to jump

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
that way but another option is to jump
up<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> rock<00:01:26.700> next<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> capture

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
up on this rock next to it and capture

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
up on this rock next to it and capture
from<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:29.280> might<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
from there and that just might be a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
from there and that just might be a
place<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.270> nobody<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.720> expects<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> look

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
place that nobody really expects to look

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
place that nobody really expects to look
okay<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.520> we're<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> start<00:01:33.090> towards<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
okay so we're going to start towards the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.700 
okay so we're going to start towards the
8th<00:01:33.630> leg<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
8th leg and then we're going to do a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
8th leg and then we're going to do a
loop<00:01:34.950> around<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> map<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> lot<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> people

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
loop around the map so a lot of people

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.420 
loop around the map so a lot of people
aren't<00:01:37.409> aware<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.009> actually<00:01:38.130> jump

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
aren't aware that you can actually jump

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
aren't aware that you can actually jump
on<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.700> vehicle<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.600> jump

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
on this vehicle here and then jump

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.719 
on this vehicle here and then jump
across<00:01:39.990> through<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.380> roof<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> then<00:01:41.520> from

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
across through this roof and then from

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.160 
across through this roof and then from
here<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> also<00:01:42.240> jump<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.869> little

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
here you can also jump to this little

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
here you can also jump to this little
overhanging<00:01:43.860> part<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.399> roof<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.880> well

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
overhanging part on this roof as well

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420 
overhanging part on this roof as well
and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:46.350> under<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> sign<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and you can go under the sign here and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.590 
and you can go under the sign here and
you<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:47.909> nice<00:01:48.060> line-of-sight<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you get a really nice line-of-sight to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
you get a really nice line-of-sight to
that<00:01:48.810> Ridge<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.399> also<00:01:50.520> jump<00:01:50.820> back

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that Ridge or you can also jump back

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.670 
that Ridge or you can also jump back
this<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.170> roof<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this way and from this roof you get a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.039 
this way and from this roof you get a
really<00:01:53.040> nice<00:01:53.189> line<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.030> sight<00:01:54.210> into<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.659> area

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
really nice line of sight into this area

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.389 
really nice line of sight into this area
so<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.439> people<00:01:55.740> are<00:01:55.829> coming<00:01:55.979> through<00:01:56.100> there

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
so if people are coming through there

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.240 
so if people are coming through there
you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.670> pick<00:01:56.790> them<00:01:56.969> off<00:01:57.119> easily<00:01:58.159> with<00:01:59.159> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you can pick them off easily with this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
you can pick them off easily with this
building<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.820> unfortunately<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.869> my

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
building here unfortunately to my

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
building here unfortunately to my
knowledge<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.560> cannot<00:02:02.070> jump<00:02:02.399> from<00:02:02.610> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
knowledge you cannot jump from this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
knowledge you cannot jump from this
vehicle<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> window<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> looks<00:02:04.229> like

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
vehicle into the window it looks like

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
vehicle into the window it looks like
you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.460> tried<00:02:05.820> several<00:02:06.149> times<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you can but I tried several times and I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.960 
you can but I tried several times and I
wasn't<00:02:07.200> able<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.039> maybe<00:02:08.729> it's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
wasn't able to do it so maybe it's

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
wasn't able to do it so maybe it's
possible<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.869> missed<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
possible and I just missed it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.100 
possible and I just missed it
but<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.430> knowledge<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.790> can't<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
but to my knowledge you can't do it you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.490 
but to my knowledge you can't do it you
can't

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
can't

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.230 
can't
ever<00:02:13.710> jump<00:02:13.980> into<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.280> window<00:02:14.610> here<00:02:14.880> from<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
ever jump into this window here from the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.760 
ever jump into this window here from the
ridge<00:02:17.660> now<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.900> outside<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.380> building<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
ridge now just outside that building you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.990 
ridge now just outside that building you
can<00:02:19.920> actually<00:02:20.190> jump<00:02:20.340> onto<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:20.790> green

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
can actually jump onto this green

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.450 
can actually jump onto this green
electrical<00:02:21.540> box<00:02:21.750> thing<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.230> here<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.620> from

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
electrical box thing right here and from

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.680 
electrical box thing right here and from
there<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.910> actually<00:02:24.030> jump<00:02:24.360> straight

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
there you can actually jump straight

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.480 
there you can actually jump straight
across<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> thing<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.070> really<00:02:26.340> not

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
across to this thing and it's really not

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.430 
across to this thing and it's really not
the<00:02:26.610> most<00:02:26.640> useful<00:02:27.000> spot<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.570> are<00:02:27.750> exposed<00:02:28.200> out

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
the most useful spot you are exposed out

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.470 
the most useful spot you are exposed out
here<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.220> sometimes<00:02:29.700> people<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.240> hang

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
here but sometimes people like to hang

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.510 
here but sometimes people like to hang
out<00:02:30.630> here<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.080> maybe<00:02:31.260> you'll<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.980> take

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
out here and maybe you'll use it to take

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.310 
out here and maybe you'll use it to take
one<00:02:32.790> guy<00:02:32.940> by<00:02:33.330> surprise<00:02:33.720> or<00:02:33.930> something<00:02:34.200> like

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
one guy by surprise or something like

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.810 
one guy by surprise or something like
that<00:02:34.380> as<00:02:34.740> they<00:02:34.890> come<00:02:35.040> around<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.280> corner<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
that as they come around the corner and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.760 
that as they come around the corner and
you<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.660> also<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.170> from<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.440> side<00:02:37.500> by

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
you can also do it from this side by

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.260 
you can also do it from this side by
jumping<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> barrel<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.700> then<00:02:38.790> mantling

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
jumping on the barrel and then mantling

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.890 
jumping on the barrel and then mantling
up<00:02:40.430> now<00:02:41.430> over<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:42.450> favorite

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
up now over here is one of my favorite

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
up now over here is one of my favorite
spots<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.650> map<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.040> use<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:44.790> great

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
spots on this map to use and it's great

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.370 
spots on this map to use and it's great
for<00:02:45.240> defending<00:02:45.630> against<00:02:45.930> people<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.290> are

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
you're also exposing yourself quite a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.560 
you're also exposing yourself quite a
bit<00:03:19.170> by<00:03:19.380> being<00:03:19.650> out<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:19.950> these<00:03:20.070> windows<00:03:20.570> now

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
bit by being out in these windows now

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.850 
bit by being out in these windows now
instead<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.870> exposing<00:03:22.350> yourself<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.769> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
instead of exposing yourself in the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.710 
instead of exposing yourself in the
windows<00:03:23.130> there<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.489> great<00:03:23.820> alternative<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.570> to

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
windows there a great alternative is to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.449 
windows there a great alternative is to
jump<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.049> top<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.440> tool<00:03:25.680> box<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.190> here

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.680 
jump on top of this tool box right here
and<00:03:26.580> then<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:27.150> can<00:03:27.239> look<00:03:27.420> through<00:03:27.570> this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
and then you can look through this

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.449 
and then you can look through this
little<00:03:27.930> crack<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> window<00:03:28.860> there<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.340> you

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
little crack in the window there and you

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.800 
little crack in the window there and you
get<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:29.850> nice<00:03:30.060> line<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.360> sight<00:03:30.540> into<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810

get a really nice line of sight into the
ship<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:31.380> from<00:03:31.560> back<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.040> also

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
ship and then from back here you also

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.770 
ship and then from back here you also
get<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.489> line<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.730> sight<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.540> Ridge

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
get a line of sight on to that Ridge

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.020 
get a line of sight on to that Ridge
where<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.110> snipers<00:03:34.470> love<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.980> hang<00:03:35.130> out<00:03:35.340> so

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
where the snipers love to hang out so

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.430 
where the snipers love to hang out so

on these barrels and you get a really

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.650 
on these barrels and you get a really
really<00:03:41.220> nice<00:03:41.640> line-of-sight<00:03:42.209> right<00:03:42.420> there

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
really nice line-of-sight right there

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.390 
really nice line-of-sight right there
this<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.049> great<00:03:43.350> for<00:03:43.560> first<00:03:43.709> Bloods<00:03:44.040> because

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
elsewhere but from right here if you go

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.840 
elsewhere but from right here if you go
down<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.829> pole<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> little<00:04:11.310> bit<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.700> get<00:04:11.820> a

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
down the pole a little bit you get a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.340 
down the pole a little bit you get a
really<00:04:12.090> nice<00:04:12.269> line-of-sight<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.079> Ridge

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
really nice line-of-sight to that Ridge

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.780 
really nice line-of-sight to that Ridge
and<00:04:13.530> all<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.829> have<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.040> do<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.250> crouch<00:04:14.519> and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
and all you have to do is crouch and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.849 
and all you have to do is crouch and
you're<00:04:14.880> completely<00:04:15.180> behind<00:04:15.630> cover<00:04:15.870> now<00:04:16.650> as

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
you're completely behind cover now as

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.380 
you're completely behind cover now as
you<00:04:17.010> come<00:04:17.130> towards<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.519> sea<00:04:17.669> flag<00:04:17.910> here<00:04:18.180> this

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
you come towards the sea flag here this

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.210 
you come towards the sea flag here this
is<00:04:18.540> probably<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.290> most<00:04:19.440> useful<00:04:19.709> spots

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
is probably one of the most useful spots

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.680 
is probably one of the most useful spots
that<00:04:20.489> you'll<00:04:20.640> see<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.090> video<00:04:21.269> and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
that you'll see in this video and

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.420 
that you'll see in this video and
instead<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.380> coming<00:04:22.650> around<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:22.919> corner<00:04:22.979> and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
instead of coming around this corner and

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.740 
instead of coming around this corner and
battling<00:04:23.729> people<00:04:24.030> on<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.240> ridge<00:04:24.450> which<00:04:24.720> is

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
battling people on the ridge which is

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.060 
battling people on the ridge which is
what<00:04:24.990> most<00:04:25.140> people<00:04:25.470> will<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.950> can

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
what most people will do you can

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.320 
what most people will do you can
actually<00:04:26.220> jump<00:04:26.550> right<00:04:26.789> here

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
actually jump right here

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.540 
actually jump right here
onto<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:27.990> tree<00:04:28.349> and<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:28.949> just<00:04:29.189> kind<00:04:29.490> of

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
onto this tree and then just kind of

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.980 
onto this tree and then just kind of
edge<00:04:29.699> your<00:04:29.939> way<00:04:29.970> up<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.509> there<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.750> go<00:04:30.930> you

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
edge your way up and there you go you

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.360 
edge your way up and there you go you
get<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.259> little<00:04:31.560> bit<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.830> head<00:04:31.949> glitch<00:04:32.129> over

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
get a little bit of a head glitch over

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.920 
get a little bit of a head glitch over
top<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.819> you<00:04:33.000> can<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.150> pick<00:04:33.449> them<00:04:33.539> off<00:04:33.659> that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
top and you can just pick them off that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.719 
top and you can just pick them off that
way<00:04:34.110> there's<00:04:34.590> no<00:04:34.979> way<00:04:35.159> they're<00:04:35.340> gonna<00:04:35.430> expect

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
way there's no way they're gonna expect

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.909 
way there's no way they're gonna expect
you<00:04:35.969> to<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.180> coming<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.599> way<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.409> you'll<00:04:37.680> take

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
you to be coming that way so you'll take

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.610 
you to be coming that way so you'll take
them<00:04:38.099> out<00:04:38.280> basically<00:04:39.030> every<00:04:39.270> time<00:04:39.530> now<00:04:40.530> if

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
them out basically every time now if

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.929 
them out basically every time now if
you're<00:04:40.740> on<00:04:40.800> top<00:04:41.009> of<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.129> ship<00:04:41.219> right<00:04:41.520> here<00:04:41.729> and

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
you're on top of the ship right here and

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.100 
you're on top of the ship right here and
you<00:04:42.060> want<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.270> take<00:04:42.389> out<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.689> guys<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.020> are

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
you want to take out the guys that are

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.450 
you want to take out the guys that are
in<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.229> windows<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.889> building<00:04:44.219> we<00:04:44.340> were

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
in the windows of the building we were

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.459 
in the windows of the building we were
just<00:04:44.639> in<00:04:44.879> instead<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.870> doing<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.110> from<00:04:46.259> back

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
just in instead of doing it from back

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.320 
just in instead of doing it from back
here<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:47.069> best<00:04:47.340> way<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.580> do<00:04:47.819> it<00:04:47.939> is<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.180> come

here the best way to do it is to come

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.089 
here the best way to do it is to come
over<00:04:48.360> here<00:04:48.810> jump<00:04:49.169> on<00:04:49.289> top<00:04:49.439> of<00:04:49.500> this<00:04:49.710> railing

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
over here jump on top of this railing

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.459 
over here jump on top of this railing
right<00:04:50.219> here<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.930> there<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.050> go<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.229> have<00:04:52.439> a

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
right here and there you go you have a

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.200 
right here and there you go you have a
really<00:04:52.770> nice<00:04:52.889> line<00:04:53.159> of<00:04:53.280> sight<00:04:53.490> over<00:04:53.789> top<00:04:53.969> all

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
really nice line of sight over top all

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.369 
really nice line of sight over top all
you<00:04:54.330> have<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.539> do<00:04:54.629> is<00:04:54.750> crouch<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.139> you<00:04:55.259> have

you have to do is crouch and you have
lots<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.680> cover<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:56.129> you<00:04:56.759> can<00:04:56.789> pick<00:04:57.000> those

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
lots of cover and you can pick those

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.330 
lots of cover and you can pick those
guys<00:04:57.330> off<00:04:57.539> in<00:04:57.689> the<00:04:57.780> windows<00:04:58.129> moving<00:04:59.129> on<00:04:59.219> to

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
guys off in the windows moving on to

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.339 
guys off in the windows moving on to
this<00:04:59.430> Ridge<00:04:59.669> by<00:04:59.879> sea<00:05:00.210> most<00:05:00.690> people<00:05:00.960> will<00:05:01.110> snipe

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
this Ridge by sea most people will snipe

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.619 
this Ridge by sea most people will snipe
from<00:05:01.560> right<00:05:01.830> around<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.250> area<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.849> instead

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
from right around this area and instead

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.180 
from right around this area and instead
of<00:05:03.750> doing<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.139> a<00:05:04.169> much<00:05:04.590> better<00:05:04.800> way<00:05:05.009> that<00:05:05.039> I

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
of doing that a much better way that I

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.830 
of doing that a much better way that I
found<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.639> to<00:05:05.729> jump<00:05:05.909> on<00:05:06.030> this<00:05:06.180> rock<00:05:06.360> here<00:05:06.659> and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
found is to jump on this rock here and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.990 
found is to jump on this rock here and
it<00:05:07.020> gives<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.259> much<00:05:07.500> more<00:05:07.530> cover<00:05:10.759> now<00:05:11.759> moving

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
it gives you much more cover now moving

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.399 
it gives you much more cover now moving
on<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.360> logging<00:05:12.750> building<00:05:13.050> right<00:05:13.199> here

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
on to this logging building right here

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.320 
on to this logging building right here
there<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.740> bomb<00:05:14.009> site<00:05:14.219> in<00:05:14.400> here<00:05:14.639> and<00:05:14.849> often

going all the way around and jumping
across<00:05:42.810> you<00:05:43.139> can<00:05:43.259> actually<00:05:43.379> just<00:05:43.650> mantle<00:05:44.039> up

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
across you can actually just mantle up

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.339 
across you can actually just mantle up
here<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.610> then<00:05:44.879> mantle<00:05:45.300> again<00:05:45.569> and<00:05:45.779> that's

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
here and then mantle again and that's

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.689 
here and then mantle again and that's
just<00:05:46.589> a<00:05:46.650> really<00:05:46.800> quick<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.159> easy<00:05:47.219> way<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.520> get

just a really quick and easy way to get

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.700 
just a really quick and easy way to get
up<00:05:47.909> it<00:05:48.029> may<00:05:48.270> look<00:05:48.449> obvious<00:05:48.930> but<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.199> didn't<00:05:49.650> know

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
up it may look obvious but I didn't know

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.369 
up it may look obvious but I didn't know
about<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:49.979> until<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:50.310> tested<00:05:50.759> it<00:05:50.819> in<00:05:50.969> this<00:05:51.150> video

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
about it until I tested it in this video

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.719 
about it until I tested it in this video
now<00:05:52.379> over<00:05:52.680> here<00:05:52.919> this<00:05:53.069> is<00:05:53.129> probably<00:05:53.580> obvious

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
now over here this is probably obvious

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.640 
now over here this is probably obvious
to<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.120> lot<00:05:54.210> of<00:05:54.479> you<00:05:54.629> but<00:05:54.810> some<00:05:55.050> of<00:05:55.139> you<00:05:55.259> guys<00:05:55.379> may

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
to a lot of you but some of you guys may

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.110 
to a lot of you but some of you guys may
not<00:05:55.800> know<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.339> can<00:05:56.460> actually<00:05:56.580> jump<00:05:56.940> from

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
not know that you can actually jump from

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.700 
not know that you can actually jump from
this<00:05:57.240> Ridge<00:05:57.509> on<00:05:57.750> top<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.259> roof<00:05:58.469> right<00:05:58.650> here

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
this Ridge on top of the roof right here

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.529 
this Ridge on top of the roof right here
and<00:05:59.129> then<00:05:59.610> from<00:05:59.789> here<00:05:59.819> you<00:06:00.060> can<00:06:00.180> also<00:06:00.300> jump

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
and then from here you can also jump

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.119 
and then from here you can also jump
around<00:06:00.839> to<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.110> other<00:06:01.259> part<00:06:01.560> of<00:06:01.589> the<00:06:01.680> roof<00:06:01.860> or

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129 
around to the other part of the roof or

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.379 
around to the other part of the roof or
you<00:06:02.279> can<00:06:02.400> just<00:06:02.580> use<00:06:02.729> this<00:06:02.879> four<00:06:03.089> lines<00:06:03.240> of

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
you can just use this four lines of

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.420 
you can just use this four lines of
sight<00:06:03.629> and<00:06:03.870> once<00:06:04.589> again<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:05.009> know<00:06:05.069> you<00:06:05.219> guys

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
sight and once again I know you guys

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.430 
sight and once again I know you guys

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719

that<00:06:37.529> can<00:06:37.649> be<00:06:37.770> really<00:06:38.009> useful<00:06:38.159> if<00:06:38.550> maybe

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
that can be really useful if maybe

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.399 
that can be really useful if maybe
you're<00:06:39.029> up<00:06:39.149> in<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.360> second-story<00:06:39.870> and<00:06:40.229> you

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
them you can just jump out the window

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.899 
them you can just jump out the window
and<00:06:44.319> then<00:06:44.770> go<00:06:44.919> for<00:06:45.099> a<00:06:45.129> little<00:06:45.219> flank<00:06:45.550> on<00:06:45.729> them

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
and then go for a little flank on them

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.730 
and then go for a little flank on them
or<00:06:45.999> something<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.509> they'll<00:06:47.110> have<00:06:47.259> no<00:06:47.439> idea

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
or something and they'll have no idea

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.010 
or something and they'll have no idea
what<00:06:47.949> hit<00:06:48.099> them<00:06:48.129> all<00:06:49.119> right<00:06:49.479> so<00:06:49.689> now<00:06:49.809> for<00:06:49.869> my

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
what hit them all right so now for my

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.809 
what hit them all right so now for my
last<00:06:50.289> spot<00:06:50.529> it's<00:06:50.770> at<00:06:50.919> the<00:06:51.069> beef<00:06:51.219> leg<00:06:51.460> and<00:06:51.669> this

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
last spot it's at the beef leg and this

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.999 
last spot it's at the beef leg and this
only<00:06:52.210> works<00:06:52.449> if<00:06:52.659> you<00:06:52.930> spawned<00:06:53.259> at<00:06:53.439> the<00:06:53.529> a<00:06:53.559> flag

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
only works if you spawned at the a flag

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.679 
only works if you spawned at the a flag
because<00:06:54.369> that<00:06:54.520> means<00:06:54.639> you<00:06:55.029> have<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.419> gray

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:55.689 
because that means you have the gray

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:57.600 
because that means you have the gray
uniforms<00:06:56.319> that<00:06:56.409> blend<00:06:56.710> into<00:06:56.889> the<00:06:57.039> rocks<00:06:57.279> and
