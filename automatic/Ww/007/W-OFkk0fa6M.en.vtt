00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.680
 a red baby 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.209
 this is me 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.939
 beans produced abroad but not for 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.909
 these are ugly and without 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.039
 prices 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.730
 the router it 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.960
 maybe I am looking for 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.320
 enea romanticissimo 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.339
 the professor. 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
 it's very strong 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.900
 those instead is a very important thing 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
 the state is an olive tree 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 clean the streets use trunks and costumes 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.840
 see if another 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.440
 Ravetto 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.160
 and symbolizes 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.990
 a little ours 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
 dimension of being others invest 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.880
 in the christ trunk 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.280
 because Jesus said I am the vine 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.310
 you are the branches 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.540
 who stays in this tell me 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 bears much fruit 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.230
 the grafted branch 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
 takes the sap from the main trunk 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 produces the fruit according to his 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.650
 nature 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 and then we are in Christ 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000
 we give ours 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.050
 specificity 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.660
 but the mood is the sap 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.500
 and the graph comes from crissa 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.980
 Here because 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.960
 and being a Christian means 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.420
 it's just one with him 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.530
 therefore sanpaolo then says 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.780
 whether you eat or see, I go among us ladies because God does everything 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.820
 in all 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.160
 this dimension is a dimension 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.640
 that we have forgotten as if it were a thing 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.400
 in the past era 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.370
 and less bad hotel bellevue I spent because on this certain 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.770
 we invest ourselves 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490
 because none of us thanks 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.490
 car generated in the native sun 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.249
 we drink cydia be very love 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.309
 from - of such 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.469
 which belongs to the current of life 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:21.959
 we are 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.609
 an aspect of life 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.690
 but life comes from the author of life 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.880
 and none of us can be sent to be the author of life 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.130
 we receive life 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.579
 by who the author is 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.259
 and when + 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.769
 we know how to use it 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.269
 the closer we get 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.549
 to the author of life 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.730
 to stay 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.739
 bb 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 for eternal life 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.059
 it's a laurel 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.359

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.499
 but anyway I really want to 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:09.939
 words lose 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.649

 a dry leaf from the previous cycle 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.269
 then the leaves 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.599
 are born

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.199
 to multiply 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.259
 alone they make a sort of 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.729
 family 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.299
 d bulbs 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.299

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.209
