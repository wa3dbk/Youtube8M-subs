00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.800
 who likes barbecue must be with 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.330
 mouth water just seeing these pictures 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.130
 the problem is that this type of menu 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 usually accompanied by a lot of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 fat and carbohydrates that can ruin 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 a diet but is it possible 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 take advantage of these delights in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.990
 weight at risk is not to exaggerate 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.300
 especially in meat is important 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.910
 make a deal with a salad with 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.920
 pretty greens vegetables mostly 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.899
 that they have fibers and will marry a lot 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.809
 more society to us 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.909
 And do not confuse salad with salad 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.399
 mayonnaise in this rich blend of 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.600
 fat and carbohydrates not recommended 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.269
 for those who do not want to gain a few pounds 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 but what would be a good barbecue without 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.030
 the meats 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.319
 The trick is to take moderation and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.569
 leaner meats 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.690
 so the red meat will be mine 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.309
 or the duckling are meats that have a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 lower amount of fat 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.470
 if we think now about the ideal chicken 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.540
 even taken from his skin and already the fish 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.990
 we can think of salmon in whiting 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 which are slightly more fat-free meats 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 no df 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 but if you do not resist a picanha 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
 calm down a tip whenever possible 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.560
 remove the fat wall and of course be 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 moderate in relation to the amount of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.190
 beef 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.900
 who will eat a filet do not overdo it on 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.270
 not find that just because it has 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
 a barbecue can eat more barbecues 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.740
 often linked to the celebrations 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.980
 What is not lacking in this type of event is the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.320
 famous beer the alcoholic beverage she 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.110
 need not be taken fully but the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.940
 people can not consume much has to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.430
 be in moderation then we should 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.550
 always think if it's a caipirinha only 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
 a caipirinha and beer also with 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.880
 moderation does not exceed two and pot 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.190
 beer lines 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.380
 to know more about barbecue access
