00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
was so good i knew i could probably get

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.609 
was so good i knew i could probably get
a<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:23.009> lift<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.520> those<00:01:24.270> waves<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.960> come

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a good lift but those waves would come

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.460 
a good lift but those waves would come
over<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.159> tops<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.700> those<00:01:26.850> floats<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> once<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
over the tops of those floats and once I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.690 
over the tops of those floats and once I
he<00:01:28.710> collects<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.810> step<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.530> made<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> wave

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
he collects a step going and made a wave

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
he collects a step going and made a wave
would<00:01:32.970> hit<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> drop<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:34.350> back<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:35.040> to

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
bit more speed but the other one is an 8

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.380
