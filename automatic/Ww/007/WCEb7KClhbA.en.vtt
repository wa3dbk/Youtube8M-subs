00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.300 
number two so the decision to keep it i
think<00:01:55.899> is<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> really<00:01:56.259> good<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:56.649> i<00:01:56.680> certainly

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
think is a really good one i certainly

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.370 
think is a really good one i certainly
think<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.579> confuse<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.060> market<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.450> bit<00:01:58.600> but<00:01:59.320> I

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
think we confuse the market a bit but I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.319 
think we confuse the market a bit but I
think<00:01:59.649> we've<00:02:00.250> recovered<00:02:00.549> well<00:02:00.850> from<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.149> I

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
think we've recovered well from that I

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.819 
think we've recovered well from that I
think<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:01.750> gone<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:01.930> bit<00:02:01.990> quieter<00:02:02.469> now<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
think it's gone a bit quieter now in the

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.770 
think it's gone a bit quieter now in the
market<00:02:03.219> and<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.149> decision<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.630> keep

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
market and I think the decision to keep

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.480 
market and I think the decision to keep
it<00:02:04.990> we're<00:02:05.140> much<00:02:05.350> much<00:02:05.649> stronger<00:02:05.979> with<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.399> in

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it we're much much stronger with it in

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.580 
it we're much much stronger with it in
the<00:02:06.579> portfolio<00:02:06.850> than<00:02:07.329> without<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.049> the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
the portfolio than without it and the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.499 
the portfolio than without it and the
whole<00:02:08.739> specs<00:02:09.190> it's<00:02:09.489> really<00:02:09.790> neatly<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.390> is

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
whole specs it's really neatly and it is

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.789 
whole specs it's really neatly and it is
