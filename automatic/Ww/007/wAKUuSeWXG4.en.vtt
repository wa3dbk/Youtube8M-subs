00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 gerardo martino leaves Barcelona 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.850
 martino has a contract for two 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.770
 seasons with Barcelona but will leave 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.930
 to be the coach of the club in May of 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.800
 Next year the reasons are that 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.450
 I counted the I do not feel happy is not 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.490
 absolute protagonist of the practices 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.070
 when he gets to train the team and 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.380
 to training is 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.290
 developed and defined and he is a 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.110
 manager who chooses who puts whom 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.930
 takes out but does not have absolute control 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.790
 of what happens in the day to day of the club 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.950
 and this he does not like 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.250
 he feels happy directing another 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.320
 way having full powers to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 to be able to decide if I want to do but 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.300
 stops the prota stops and tomorrow 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.829
 I want to do 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 or physical towards physical work 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.530
 this what he told his best 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.640
 friend who was with him a month and a half 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.670
 in Barcelona and this person was told 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.439
 to a known friend of mine friend too 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 and all of us who are going as well as we 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.640
 We are staying in the studio because 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 leads one of the best clubs in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.900
 world apart is in the place where 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 probably many should arrive 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.810
 and he is not happy with what he is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.310
 happening but 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.439
 this I must say that it reaches 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.600
 training is already started or there 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.610
 other things can not be the true one to 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.799
 he likes it because it's the methodology of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.740
 work he has 27 collaborators against 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.460
 He is not a working methodology 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.649
 is one has 27 assistants for a 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.039
 coaching staff that is used to 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.840
 define what needs to be done and here not 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.630
 I can define it completely then 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.030
 he feels bounded in his radius of 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.979
 action and this 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.740
 It gives the feeling that there are things that do not 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.600
 he can handle them and that this prevents him 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.820
 be completely happy as a coach 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.860
 directs the best player in the world and 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.890
 probably addresses the bank or one of the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.850
 most greedy bank on the planet 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.649
 economically I do not know how much you should earn 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.950
 but in the president mind first 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.330
 important but not comfortable where 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 it is not about criticism 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.590
 external 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.050
 if it has to do with what there is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.770
 players that he is not that they do not have 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.750
 more good filming there is something repeated 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.060
 what he did in Paraguay for example 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.560
 I think in Paraguay ended the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.720
 going after the america cup because it 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.950
 he noticed something similar to this as 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.800
 that there were some great players that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.650
 they were watching his cycle and maybe he 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.010
 he did not want to face that decision to have 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.990
 be he who say do not do more than you 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.490
 surprise of news wan a lot much 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.750
 HernÃ¡n 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.580
 on the piece of paper the name of OPEC 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.680
 had put hernandez and then 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.590
 it was finally treated he told me is the one of 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.260
 up and it's fine channel that now I'm going to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.230
 show another 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.209
 this what put feller data opep had 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.610
 lied under better from above is the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.129
 channel put number two and multi two 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.629
 players do not know if at the same time and 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.629
 after he put treats this is the other 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.760
 we have two minutes left 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.810
 I want to listen surprised to the former not what 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:24.439
 absolute absolute is not happy 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.629
 this I'm surprised that it was 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.410
 that the decision has already taken I thought 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.810
 that the best 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.180
 if I had taken it personally it is 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.680
 unnecessary to anyone if only at 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.680
 people closest to him that I see him 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.450
 that it was like the way he did it and that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.160
 that decision made it public at the end 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.460
 of season in May in July when 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.840
 supposedly but that does not generate nor 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.290
 even his wife 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.850
 let's say I had really surprised 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.240
 this we keep being things 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.320
 as it hurts me hurts me afraid pass 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.840
 the same thing you know if not those feelings 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.210
 sadness and sadness what kind of the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.310
 ability and the opportunity I had for 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.900
 to confront would have liked to have 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.840
 that go in any case for bad results 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.730
 although it did not go well 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.800
 and the other 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.379
 what was going to happen with months that's a 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.850
 reflection that gave me an eye when I said 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.919
 fabio eye but yes we spent half an hour 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.229
 because that's how he did a lot so that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.479
 call tino or not obviously is wrong or 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.760
 not because they also follow me 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.949
 at a time that had to do with a 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.590
 feeling that he was not well and the 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.660
 arrival of kingfisher or placated a bit 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.120
 this and put it back with a 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.850
 protagonism that had no month and if it goes 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.590
 the one who applied it must see if not 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.820
 everything that angers him 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.560
 detail of the arguments he gave 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.930
 Fabian were applicable to the month and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.490
 they realized that is the argument that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.100
 Fabian is why he goes to Marti 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.650
 were applicable to month and according to detail I 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.600
 it seems very interesting gentlemen we are 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.229
 talking program thanks factory of nothing 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.229
 very good information
