00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and see you know exactly what we've done

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
compared to what the image was that was

compared to what the image was that was
sent<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.260> us<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:17.310> over<00:02:17.489> here<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
sent to us but over here on the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.070 
sent to us but over here on the
right-hand<00:02:17.940> side<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.870> see

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
right-hand side you know you can see

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
right-hand side you know you can see
that<00:02:19.110> we've<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> clouds<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that we've got like the clouds and the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.900 
that we've got like the clouds and the
white<00:02:21.900> parts<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> clouds<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.069> like<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
white parts of the clouds and like the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.479 
white parts of the clouds and like the
yellow<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.480> guess<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.959> storm<00:02:25.290> part<00:02:25.739> you

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
yellow I guess like the storm part you

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.949 
yellow I guess like the storm part you
know<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:26.790> um<00:02:27.060> i<00:02:27.269> guess<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.480> sort<00:02:27.900> of

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
know it's um i guess like sort of

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.100 
know it's um i guess like sort of
lightning<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.910> know<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.060> solar<00:02:30.720> flares

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
lightning or you know just solar flares

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.630 
lightning or you know just solar flares
or<00:02:31.379> something<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.799> coming<00:02:32.250> out<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
or something like that coming out of the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.770 
or something like that coming out of the
sign<00:02:32.880> here<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.299> then<00:02:35.060> sort<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.120> transitions

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
sign here and then sort of transitions

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.110 
sign here and then sort of transitions
over<00:02:36.870> into<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.860> i<00:02:38.010> don't<00:02:38.700> want<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> call<00:02:39.090> it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
over into like a i don't want to call it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.970 
over into like a i don't want to call it
a<00:02:39.239> purple<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.870> when<00:02:40.170> red<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.590> blue<00:02:40.739> mix

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
a purple but it's when red and blue mix

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.160 
a purple but it's when red and blue mix
it's<00:02:41.190> almost<00:02:41.430> purple<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:43.019> it's<00:02:43.110> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
it's almost purple you know it's a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.539 
it's almost purple you know it's a
darker<00:02:43.560> color<00:02:43.920> right<00:02:44.160> here<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.489> middle

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
darker color right here in the middle

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.660 
darker color right here in the middle
and<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.599> transfers<00:02:46.110> over<00:02:46.410> into<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.069> red<00:02:47.250> where

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and it transfers over into the red where

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.059 
and it transfers over into the red where
there<00:02:47.970> are<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> lot<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.930> red<00:02:49.380> flakes<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:49.950> we've

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
there are a lot of red flakes so we've

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.740 
there are a lot of red flakes so we've
got<00:02:50.250> red<00:02:50.459> flake<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.970> majority<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.540> side

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
got red flake the majority on this side

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930 
got red flake the majority on this side
we've<00:02:51.989> got<00:02:52.019> blue<00:02:52.530> flake<00:02:52.860> over<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.880> side

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
we've got blue flake over on this side

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.670 
we've got blue flake over on this side
then<00:02:54.329> we<00:02:54.480> dust<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> whole<00:02:55.349> entire

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
then we dust it the whole entire

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.729 
then we dust it the whole entire
controller<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.150> silver<00:02:57.540> flake<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.380> just

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
controller with a silver flake it just

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.250 
controller with a silver flake it just
adds<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.790> much<00:03:00.180> character<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.959> control

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
adds so much character to this control

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.660 
adds so much character to this control
little<00:03:01.440> against<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.980> I've<00:03:02.099> always<00:03:02.250> said<00:03:02.370> we

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
little against like I've always said we

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.670 
little against like I've always said we
go<00:03:02.819> above<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.329> beyond<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.930> use<00:03:04.109> materials

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
go above and beyond we use materials

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.379 
go above and beyond we use materials
that<00:03:04.769> not<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> lot<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.489> other<00:03:05.760> people<00:03:05.910> even<00:03:06.209> have

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
that not a lot of other people even have

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.660 
that not a lot of other people even have
access<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.959> at<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.889> complete<00:03:08.280> your<00:03:08.489> guys

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
see guys this whole controller is just

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.370 
see guys this whole controller is just
dusted<00:03:16.319> with<00:03:16.440> flake<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.510> sides<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.200> have

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
dusted with flake and sides here we have

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.920 
dusted with flake and sides here we have
our<00:03:19.500> tactical<00:03:20.190> grip<00:03:20.400> which<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.299> very<00:03:21.720> popular

the only place it is then we

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.880 
the only place it is then we
more<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.090> pearlescent<00:03:28.660> plate<00:03:29.200> hope<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.710> can

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
more of the pearlescent plate hope I can

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.320 
more of the pearlescent plate hope I can
get<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.280> camera<00:03:30.610> we<00:03:30.730> use<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.000> smaller

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
get that in the camera we use a smaller

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.720 
get that in the camera we use a smaller
diameter<00:03:31.720> flakes<00:03:32.320> put<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.740> back<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.580> to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
diameter flakes put on the back just to

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.890 
diameter flakes put on the back just to
sort<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.030> not<00:03:34.360> make<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.720> as<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:36.490> know<00:03:36.900> stand

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
sort of not make it as you know stand

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.500 
sort of not make it as you know stand
out<00:03:38.050> as<00:03:38.230> much<00:03:38.530> as<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.770> front<00:03:39.130> but<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.240> know<00:03:40.330> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510
