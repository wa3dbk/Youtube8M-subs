00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Welcome to a tutorial 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.390
 In this tutorial I will show how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 to receive the drivers without internet 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.719
 get out 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.490
 because with most programs needs 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.230
 to receive an internet or 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 connection with the drivers 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.949
 can locate at all 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 in the program that I introduce you 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.050
 you just want to do it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.519
 Show which drivers needed 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.779
 and you will get as well 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.900
 the link for where to get it 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.820
 can download so you need 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.109
 of course first a second computer with it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.149
 the program from the internet 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.360
 is downloaded 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'll just go to the browser 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 then give me a search engine or 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.820
 somehow always just stops at the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.360
 most likely to be google 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:53.489
 then we will enter at google 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:56.850
 23 was robert so we can get up right away 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.270
 the homepage so three what's coming there 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.500
 go 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 the link I will then in the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.530
 pack description and then we go 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.909
 since time on it here we download the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 Let 's just save it 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.840
 we had the best finished 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.490
 so it usually costs that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.170
 program also what exactly that is 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.869
 how the other programs can be 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.130
 immediately afterwards the brook the drivers from 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.990
 download internet 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.790
 but you can also do it offline 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.680
 but as I said, we can show 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.759
 need two computers with one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.590
 is internet connection well let's set 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.860
 open folder I still have the old one 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.780
 version but we just take driver 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.600
 robert setup then we press on it 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.790
 To run 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 then we just follow that has the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 instructions license accept here on 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.450
 make it the best way if it will 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 only the whole stars so at the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.890
 tas circle winner become the toolbars 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.940
 added everywhere 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.800
 pretty annoying so just next 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.360
 then it is installed we start 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.150
 but make it and now we go 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.640
 assuming that we have a pc without 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.700
 an internet connection therefore will 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:26.860
 I now make internet off now and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.860
 then we start robert in three 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.470
 state for the money now the whole 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.959
 Computers and hardware from so no 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.200
 Internet is received you can the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.800
 Just save it with us now 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.800
 times the desktop save 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.519
 then we just pull it back 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.500
 the usb stick 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.840
 So is men's under the direction of the program 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.610
 can from a second computer of course 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.430
 also first with the usb stick here 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.400
 install it on it and then it will 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.840
 One has this document then 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.060
 you put that back on the computer 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.880
 with internet that's why I do it 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.110
 right back on the internet 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.340
 that might take a while until then 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.470
 found again so there we have 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.040
 Again we just press internet 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.269
 on it and then we come on one 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.209
 side easy drivers and then you can 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.380
 Download each driver on 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:38.590
 Of course, the main driver is the driver 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:41.950
 The choice usually means something 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.950
 lan or 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.710
 yes he is with me now I would have to 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.750
 but best just all documents 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.400
 we need one way or another 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.870
 he probably will not 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 the lahn driver displays more 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.450
 already installed it but good then 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.390
 we invite because down there let's take 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.530
 for example, the intel then save 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.010
 Can you do that on the computer again 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.440
 draw in which the three are missing over 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.180
 install and then you have the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.950
 driver currently and can again per 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.090
 internet download the other drivers 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.519
 so you can do it with each one 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.079
 drivers make but as already said the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.110
 Land is the most important way to get there again 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.610
 Internet has and the pc then also the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.130
 Windows updates can do those 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.169
 also important drivers mostly already 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.290
 are there and that would be it 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.550
 actually thanks for watching and me 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.050
 Of course, not every topic will be discussed now 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.750
 So if you still have any, do it 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.650
 Questions have any other problems 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.640
 then it could be in the comments 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.160
 write 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.600
 I will do that especially if it is 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.070
 then often asked what will I do then 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:53.010
 Turn video and then upload it 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.780
 and then that could look and in that 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.840
 video exactly as your problems back 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.090
 write and I know then try 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.720
 find out and then the problems for 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.720
 to solve you
