because<00:02:21.709> now<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.099> have<00:02:22.519> all<00:02:22.760> these<00:02:22.909> things

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
because now we have all these things

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
because now we have all these things
unlocked<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.140> later<00:02:24.439> on<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.099> know

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
unlocked and it's later on and we know

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.830 
unlocked and it's later on and we know
what<00:02:25.579> to<00:02:25.730> use<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:25.909> what<00:02:26.150> not<00:02:26.299> to<00:02:26.329> use<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.780> we

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
what to use and what not to use and we

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.360 
what to use and what not to use and we
know<00:02:26.959> what<00:02:27.170> works<00:02:27.409> turns<00:02:27.859> therefore<00:02:28.220> you

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
know what works turns therefore you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.789 
know what works turns therefore you
might<00:02:28.549> be<00:02:28.730> able<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.939> escalate<00:02:29.510> your<00:02:29.840> CSR<00:02:30.620> ring

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.380 
might be able to escalate your CSR ring
up<00:02:31.010> really<00:02:31.430> quickly<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:31.879> that's<00:02:32.120> out<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.299> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
up really quickly so that's out of the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.940 
up really quickly so that's out of the
way<00:02:32.420> let's<00:02:32.629> talk<00:02:32.840> what<00:02:33.019> is<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.260> Opie<00:02:33.650> or<00:02:33.769> not

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
way let's talk what is it Opie or not

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.679 
way let's talk what is it Opie or not
because<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.250> get<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.519> lot<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.790> flack<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.120> using

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
because I get a lot of flack for using

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.449 
because I get a lot of flack for using
the<00:02:35.780> bolt<00:02:35.959> shots<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:36.980> will<00:02:37.069> see<00:02:37.099> them

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
the bolt shots and it you will see them

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.309 
the bolt shots and it you will see them
as<00:02:37.549> gameplay<00:02:37.879> because<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.510> for<00:02:38.750> one<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.109> did

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
as gameplay because one for one I did

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.470 
as gameplay because one for one I did
try<00:02:39.530> using<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.069> Magnum<00:02:40.430> more<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.849> don't<00:02:41.120> really

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
try using the Magnum more I don't really

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270 
try using the Magnum more I don't really
use<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:42.019> often<00:02:42.319> as<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.680> probably<00:02:42.950> should

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
use it as often as I probably should

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.059 
use it as often as I probably should
that's<00:02:43.909> because<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.510> don't<00:02:44.720> want<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.319> put

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
that's because I don't want to put

that<00:04:20.040> some<00:04:20.250> machine<00:04:20.549> got<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.730> lot<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.850> people

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
that some machine got a lot of people

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.400 
that some machine got a lot of people
like<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.269> too<00:04:21.390> powerful<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.959> can't<00:04:22.140> use<00:04:22.290> it

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
like it's too powerful you can't use it

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.720 
like it's too powerful you can't use it
you're<00:04:22.530> too<00:04:22.680> good<00:04:22.920> and<00:04:23.070> that's<00:04:23.400> what<00:04:23.520> people

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
you're too good and that's what people

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.340 
you're too good and that's what people
say<00:04:23.760> they<00:04:24.030> set<00:04:24.210> standards<00:04:24.720> saying<00:04:24.960> you're<00:04:25.200> too

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350
