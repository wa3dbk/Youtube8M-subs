00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.069
 so today it's about one 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.850
 ball throw your text modules the battery 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.370
 to exchange 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.910
 This time I have a lot of one comes from 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.119
 Titan pro forma wulff the battery seat 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.980
 under this blanket and we here around 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.369
 we have to open this lid beforehand 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.650
 a plastic nasa we open this 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.789
 just the mature seat in this hole 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.599
 a seal because we have a working chamber 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.169
 Let's open the lid 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.169
 simply is always relative 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 so and see the battery already 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 So we need it now 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 we need a new battery and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.970
 the builder is more important 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.070
 Battery is the name of a new battery 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.080
 and once a dime battery this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.890
 have already repaired with small 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.890
 ache 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.690
 so first we have to look that we 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.970
 this game from the plastic 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.810
 we manage to get out of it all 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.830
 these little tips a page 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.490
 here is a broken off 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.659
 normal case sims 3 this we have to 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:29.720
 Just unplug and unplug the board 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:32.149
 up and the need under plastic 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.250
 no more and therefore have the cover 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.750
 make off because deloitte down here 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.710
 Points are for the old battery 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.840
 but we can not as 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.780
 just make a white cpu the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.039
 Cut out the battery and make yours 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 but we have a bit of tension 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.860
 create all support voltage we put 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.679
 on 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.039
 At the following points once we have 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.509
 Here 's the minus point and us 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:03.250
 use this as the plus point 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.409
 it was a job to accomplish 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.220
 we would be there a bit 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.220
 fresh 14 on 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 then we would 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.640
 our support battery has the mission 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.189
 is this built in but I have 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.730
 long does not do with plus / minus 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:31.450
 exchange here is the pluspol this 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.450
 we solve now 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.549
 and here is the minus pole 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.100
 We can do without this effect 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.890
 problems 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.080
 Just take out this battery 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.860
 Do we turn the whole model on you? 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:04.130
 Again, batteries take one 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:07.130
 suction pump and solder the old battery 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.130
 france 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.680
 max from yesterday does not work out 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.480
 The job was not to press 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.560
 Here you should remember where plus and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.069
 it is also described minus 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.049
 but looking after is usually 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.389
 something bad, we have the old so 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:42.109
 the sounded and now we take ourselves 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.109
 the new battery 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.280
 by the way the same a little texts and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.000
 I'm doing a lot 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.230
 here the plus pole is marked with the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.020
 black ribbon is about or 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.380
 blunt hose we need about 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.820
 The dimensions are like the holes we are 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.640
 Of course, the old ones can do that as well 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.290
 battery no longer hurts as measures 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.740
 made that always a little bit behind 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.740
 feeling 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:23.180
 then we put the two similar ones 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.280
 bring in the battery again 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.690
 about the height as they are 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.900
 a small one should not offer that 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.040
 leg behind should not be too far 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.700
 touch nothing and mean the 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.700
 battery firmly 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.660
 as well as the festival ended but 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:02.580
 however, the overarching two of these 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:04.770
 have to show the secret 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.480
 new battery ushered in now 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.260
 Of course we will still be our city 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.930
 supersede 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:20.280
 we start with - pool and then the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:23.810
 pluspol so we already have the battery 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:29.580
 did you play you have we can now 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:33.720
 the plastic shell meet again puts me 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:37.920
 play in the back and click on it 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.740
 the other side under must load one 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.370
 is a racist is whether I sometimes 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.370
 again a piece to the rear 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.120
 next to the lid 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.440
 just read that again if 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.310
 this is also a guest is the 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.470
 install player game module and have 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.860
 first again for a long time 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.860
 Thank you for watching
