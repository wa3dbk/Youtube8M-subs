00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi all girls then i had 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.150
 thought to do a little contest 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.770
 when it reached one thousand subscribers e 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.490
 so here I am 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.210
 then I start immediately with the rules and after 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.180
 I'll show you the rewards then the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.920
 rules are all here then not meanwhile 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 I only do it Italian because so much in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.830
 video I speak only in Italian so not 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.390
 I think many foreigners follow me and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 then I don't want to spend a lot 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.859
 of money to ship abroad 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.350

 I don't accept videos with photos and that's it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.090
 you have to do the video then if you prefer 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.350

 the title of the video must be contest 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 entry for erika suap to a thing of the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520
 anyway it's enough that there is mine 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.110
 first name 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 you can use modeling pastes in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.090
 general then those that sugar 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.590
 in the air that type the fimo 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 however, I only accept the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.000
 mouldable pastes I do not accept 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.000
 drawings handmade puppets etc. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 the deadline will be May 1st 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.070
 a lot really is in a month and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.670
 ten days so it's not so much 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 as it seems there will be only one winner is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.970
 a rule that I forgot to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.790
 write that you owe me you can show 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.570
 a minimum of 10 creations and the maximum 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.900
 so there is no way you want the theme 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 the seasons so for example you 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.149
 choose creations on the summer and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 apples shown but you can choose one 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.200
 so only season I recommend all of them 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.180
 on winter all on the summer and so on 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.290
 etc 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.750
 I hope I have n't forgotten anything 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 however at most there is and rewrites the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.990
 rules in the info box if I have to 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.850
 add something we will add and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.450
 now i pass the prizes being a mini 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.490
 contests are not many then there is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 something creative and something 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.489
 horses 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.760
 then let's start with the few things 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.769
 these are creative lines 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.689
 let's say cut in half is only adhesive 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.909
 so they are very trains to attack 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:26.439
 this kind of flea activations 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:30.390
 stencil that is Japanese and cannot be seen 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.390
 because it's covered but it's like that 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.019
 very nice then we move on to things 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.180
 kawaii 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.920
 no sorry there was this too 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.569
 the silhouette of shore cuma 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 I used it to make the pancake that 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.049
 many of you have asked me to hate how 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.510

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.690

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.129
 the biscuit ice cream precisely with 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.129
 this shape is very useful 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.870
 passing precisely the things you want is 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.739
 this set of letters of re la cuma in 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.139
 France 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.370
 as you see the most refaeli cap 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.370

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:22.169

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.169

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.590
 heart always a calamity that 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:37.239
 this other band podis of feelings 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:44.049
 to the circus that is always healthy 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:46.959
 since rilakkuma then there is this that 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.879

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.650
