00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.570 

in<00:00:18.630> photography<00:00:19.439> there<00:00:19.710> are<00:00:19.859> cameras<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
in photography there are cameras and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.849 
in photography there are cameras and
lenses<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.600> use<00:00:21.869> which<00:00:22.410> allow<00:00:22.800> you

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
lenses which you can use which allow you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.910 
lenses which you can use which allow you
to<00:00:23.039> tilt<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:23.850> shift<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.510> area<00:00:24.869> focus<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.890> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to tilt or shift the area focus so that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.009 
to tilt or shift the area focus so that
you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.730> slice<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.449> your<00:00:27.570> image<00:00:27.869> in

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
you can have a slice of your image in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.290 
you can have a slice of your image in
focus<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.400> something<00:00:29.789> similar<00:00:30.060> in

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
focus and we can do something similar in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.200 
focus and we can do something similar in
Photoshop<00:00:30.869> using<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> tilt<00:00:31.830> shift<00:00:31.949> blur<00:00:32.579> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Photoshop using the tilt shift blur this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930 
Photoshop using the tilt shift blur this
blur<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> part<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> blur<00:00:34.829> gallery<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.640> so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
blur is part of the blur gallery and so

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
blur is part of the blur gallery and so
let's<00:00:36.120> take<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> look<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.140> use<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
let's take a look at how we can use this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.700 
let's take a look at how we can use this
filter<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> smart<00:00:39.030> filter<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
filter as a smart filter to do that you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
filter as a smart filter to do that you
want<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> target<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.370> layer<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> convert

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
want to target your layer and convert

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
want to target your layer and convert
the<00:00:42.660> layer<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> smart<00:00:43.170> object<00:00:43.550> one<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
seen before we have the center area

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
seen before we have the center area
which<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> protected<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.840> area<00:01:10.229> between

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
which is protected the area between

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
which is protected the area between
these<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:10.979> solid<00:01:11.610> circles<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> solid<00:01:12.540> lines

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
these two solid circles and solid lines

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.499 
these two solid circles and solid lines
is<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.260> protected<00:01:13.890> area<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.119> increase

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
is a protected area now we can increase

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
is a protected area now we can increase
or<00:01:15.810> decrease<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.500> by<00:01:16.740> clicking<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
or decrease that by clicking and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
or decrease that by clicking and
dragging<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.420> another<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
dragging this one way or another and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
dragging this one way or another and
what<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.490> decrease<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
what I want to do is decrease the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
what I want to do is decrease the
distance<00:01:21.509> between<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> lines<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> we

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
distance between the lines so that we

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
distance between the lines so that we
can<00:01:23.310> sort<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> focus<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.210> what's<00:01:24.450> happening

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can sort of focus in on what's happening

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
can sort of focus in on what's happening
if<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.740> reposition<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
if I reposition this you can see that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.300 
if I reposition this you can see that
the<00:01:27.600> slice<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.229> image<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.829> focus

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the slice of the image that's in focus

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.090 
the slice of the image that's in focus
is<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.880> area<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.409> increase<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
is this area here we can increase the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
is this area here we can increase the
blur<00:01:32.280> by<00:01:32.670> dragging<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.329> slider<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.140> by

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
blur by dragging this slider here or by

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
blur by dragging this slider here or by
working<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.130> our<00:01:35.159> slider<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.970> area<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
working with our slider in this area you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
working with our slider in this area you
can<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.290> control<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> distortion<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
can also control the distortion that you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.910 
can also control the distortion that you
have<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> area<00:01:39.869> where<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> image<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have in the area where the image is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
have in the area where the image is
blurred<00:01:41.189> sometimes<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.420> help<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
blurred sometimes this can help you to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289 
blurred sometimes this can help you to
dial<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> shape<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> blur<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
dial in the shape of the blur so that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.319 
dial in the shape of the blur so that
the<00:01:45.420> blur<00:01:45.600> looks<00:01:45.899> realistic<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.329> next

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the blur looks realistic and good next

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819 
the blur looks realistic and good next
we<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.960> dotted<00:01:49.380> line

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
we have the dotted line

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.859 
we have the dotted line
well<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> dotted<00:01:50.850> line<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.360> about<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
well the dotted line is all about the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
well the dotted line is all about the
transition<00:01:52.590> notice<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.640> area<00:01:53.970> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
transition notice that this area is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
transition notice that this area is
protected<00:01:54.270> well<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.380> there's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> transition

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
protected well then there's a transition

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
protected well then there's a transition
from<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> solid<00:01:57.090> line<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> dotted<00:01:57.930> line

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
from the solid line to the dotted line

by<00:02:07.829> working<00:02:08.099> with<00:02:08.340> both<00:02:08.550> lines<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.209> way

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
by working with both lines in this way

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.210 
by working with both lines in this way
you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.470> customize<00:02:10.739> that

another<00:02:14.640> thing<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.420> these

another thing that we can do with these

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.290 
another thing that we can do with these
controls<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.200> rotate<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> blur<00:02:17.190> by<00:02:17.790> rotating

the blur we can align this up say with

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.910 
the blur we can align this up say with
the<00:02:20.940> Hat<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.810> slice<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.500> blur<00:02:22.680> is

the Hat so that the slice of blur is

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.460 
the Hat so that the slice of blur is
just<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.460> area<00:02:23.790> right<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.110> I'll<00:02:25.320> go
