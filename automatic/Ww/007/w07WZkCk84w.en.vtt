00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 respectful people still a bit sexy 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.640
 info at the beginning we have this resigned 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.560
 a little different than usual 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
 recorded independently 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.940
 from one another that is to say to its role 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 selected and spoken alone 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 completely independent of each other and then 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.850
 we cut together 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.680
 that means that I did not know what she did 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.890
 says and that she did not know what I did 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 say and that's why it's lovely 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.650
 disjointed and I believe in it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 it gets a little bit funnier 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.830
 That's why I wanted you to start that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 explain a bit because not 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.210
 Everyone is always the description 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.550
 and yes, we hope so much 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:44.040
 fun as via and to the next scene too 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.170
 five fingers on both hands with those 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.289
 I ran a watermelon like that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 big then fully in the middle 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.020
 ends in my hand the new is the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 already so brown 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.949
 oh what we stare at us now 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.949
 picture of this zombie 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.619
 I have something between the teeth I have 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.400
 that sometimes stop me when I am 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.409
 hunger trade 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.490
 I think a meter is about that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.610
 wide 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.960
 of course I would not have what they think 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.330
 actually of people who their hands 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 Always on tables as even rude 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.810
 or to be honest I wanted you 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.729
 actually until Maine haircut 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 because somehow he seems to me 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.840
 to be wrong but maybe if I am 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.450
 that's just me, so what do you mean? 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.509
 because so my hairdresser said that it 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.780
 today the latest fashion so well what 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.369
 do you think so how do I look like this ? 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:45.119
 I want to have a child with them so 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.500
 well because I once because they have to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.670
 already to my imagination can one 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.970
 my daughters makes these quite a few 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.970
 Thing 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.100
 but I would suggest them one 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.590
 to save a little money because it is 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.729
 not yours you know you can 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.679
 not just that kind of money I'm deaf 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.690
 him married to a watertight 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.900
 a parent line to it though 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.580
 especially not all 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.780
 I would then have an excuse 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.489
 tell them that it is in theirs 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.640
 authority as one does not stress us 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.080
 just because the stripper if that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.650
 does not make me yet popular maria and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.880
 approved 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.100
 then they probably still send 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.660
 was not no no no I know that 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.110
 prices on the black market for me 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.440
 and a band with a lot more I can 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.690
 I tried the helicopter 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.569
 helicopters are doing right and they are 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.940
 are cool and are like pudding though 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.440
 you turn it backwards in one 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.599
 bowl I do not know if that makes sense 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.940
 I do not believe but back to 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.870
 I like potatoes like them 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.400
 Look at them and drive 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.079
 actually then next to them on the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.079
 couch he gets fucking 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 That was delicious. I love donors 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.519
 I like to give a stimulating taste 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.100
 love pin taste that it almost 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.319
 hornier than helicopters say they have 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.819
 really a beautiful microphone so 1 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.709
 I also had that had the same time 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.560
 color is the same size as the model 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.470
 even identical but unfortunately she became 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.970
 I stole from the great fire of 1840 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.880
 can still exactly to the face and 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.260
 to remember the voice of the criminal 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:46.519
 somehow they remind me of him 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:47.840
 funny 28 minutes a new microphone 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.420
 bought that she has such a guy 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.280
 he was pretty weird he bought it 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.350
 declined to give his name has 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.660
 white shirt on without jeans and had 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.180
 Dark circles and his hair 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.180
 were all mixed up yes and 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.500
 my hand looks weird, is not it? 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:21.570
 the piag worthy 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:23.670

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.950
 I said in this interview 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.910
 This hand is written and not 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.160
