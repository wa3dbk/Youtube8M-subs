00:00:06.957 --> 00:00:12.996
Hello, everybody. The International, the most important event in the year for every dota fan, is coming.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:17.100
No surprises that media are talking about the tournament.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.136
Let's have a look.

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.472
Top players are slowly gathering in Seattle.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:27.577
Cloud9, who gathered in HTC office for boot camp, were one of the first to announce their arrival.

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:35.252
EG are practicing in Twitch's office under the leadership of their new coach, Bulba, and ppd, who recently got injured.

00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:39.456
Reddit responded to that injury quite warmly.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:45.128
They suggested salty Peter Dager to put some salt into the wound. More kind guys recommended tango.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.499
Peter himself said that injury won't stop him from winning.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:53.637
He wasn't lying: his team defeated C9 in DotaPit final.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.311
His teammate, Aui, immediately started to troll his former squad, reminding them about 2nd place curse.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:06.850
Secret, who pulled out of DotaPit, also gathered to play some dota in RedBull office.

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:12.189
Judging by Twitter, their preparation was all down to a competition between Zai and Arteezy.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.125
Starting from cooking to rofling.

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:18.929
Artour gathered himself a whole zoo - like Chen. 

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:22.632
So, if you want to make him happy - send him some hippos.

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:27.904
And if you favor Envy - send him bears. He adores them, but we're not sure, if it's a cheer for Druid or VP.

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:33.310
Let's come back to Secret, who started to measure their MMRs.

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:36.746
Artour had a target to become top-1.

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:41.751
Meanwhile, poor Zai was pushing himself to the limit to get 6k rank, he even almost gave up.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:47.724
Luckily, community supported him and help to overcome those nasty numbers.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:54.431
While dota-community was following Zai's struggling, Bulldog, who is out of TI, was playing and singing.

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:56.399
Dread started his lion marathon.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.969
Funn1k streamed for the 1st time in 10 years.

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.172
But matumbaman, who became masturbawoman, smashed them all.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:07.777
A ton of people were watching him setting a new quality level for female streams.

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.548
CaspeRRR's tweet: "Exactly how I see female streams"

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:18.188
While foreign players were maxing their MMR and messing around on streams and boot camps, CIS players were bothered with visas.

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:20.690
VP were first to solve that issue.

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.860
ALOHA got his visa last, right after yoky.

00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:28.598
But Cema from Vega and Sonneiko from Na'Vi really made community nervous.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:33.270
Community was stirred up about the egregious situation, when 3 teams could be out of TI. 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.039
Everyone was suggesting ideas.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.377
Some advised Sonneiko to play from sip in neutral sea, 12 miles away.

00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:45.048
NS slightly hinted that he's a cool support and good-looking in yellow-black clothes.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.051
Some offered to take Demon, eternal standin.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:49.953
Even petition was created.

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:57.561
Nevertheless, Valve approached the situation seriously by involving WG senator, which was deciding factor.

00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:00.463
Players finally got their visas to USA.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.436
Info about talents invites started to appear after ESL One; community immediately began to discuss it.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:11.007
It resulted in KotlGuy and Goblak achieving their invites after all.

00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:17.614
Goblak even received a present: his new twitter account, which belonged to Jotm. Subscribe for lulz: @ArturFissura666.

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:22.385
Kaci, TI's permanent host, was one of the last to reveal her invite.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.291
She immediately started to improve her skills, involving community into this exciting process.

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:35.599
Akke tried to use this hype and offered himself as a poster boy.

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:39.069
Well, he has enough experience and appropriate appearance.

00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:45.742
His teammate, Bulldog, was even about to accept an invite as a toilet cleaner. Anything for Seattle.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.746
Slack announced that his invite told him to stay away from TI5.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:58.788
However, the event won't happen without this odious character, who didn't waste his time and made 4 more TI Down Low episodes.

00:03:58.788 --> 00:04:05.328
BadPlaya (Rus voiceover) made another video with a catchy name "Doter" and also intrigued the community with his new creation.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:09.833
NOT-GodHunt told about the cruel life of Ddos-er.

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:17.774
Jacky Mao and his colleges continue to resent because of Techies.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:21.311
Immortals were highly discussed too.

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:25.582
As Reddit noticed, gay-marriage came out before new Immortals.

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.785
But then they appeared and people quickly turned into happy.

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:33.256
Some were willing to sell their soul and teammates for the golden rocket.

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:37.160
Mini-Aegis gathered a lot of hype... and money.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.399
Reddit even offered a calculator to count how much you have to spend depending on your current level.

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.534
Secret Shop catalog was revealed!

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:50.674
Zyori was interested in leggins, as always. Community, meanwhile, didn't appreciate the absence of Faceless Rex.

00:04:50.674 --> 00:04:57.714
The most original design would be a shirt by Pajkatt. Moreover, the girls is included, as author confirmed.

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:03.320
Prize pool of TI is already bigger than previous all together.

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.388
Some already know how to spend it.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:10.293
Fear is ready to pay Kanye West to beat Arteezy up.

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:13.530
And we finally got an announcement of upcoming TI.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.770

And that's how other teams spend their time:

Vega on sofa.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:34.317

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.287

00:05:41.324 --> 00:05:43.626
VeRsuta is the most serious.
