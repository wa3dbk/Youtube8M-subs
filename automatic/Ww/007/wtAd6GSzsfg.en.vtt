was the base for this visual effects
that<00:06:22.060> would<00:06:22.150> be<00:06:22.270> additive<00:06:22.750> later<00:06:23.039> also<00:06:24.039> I

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
that would be additive later also I

00:06:24.069 --> 00:07:03.149 
that would be additive later also I
guess<00:06:24.220> it's<00:06:24.400> so<00:06:24.550> distracting

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159
