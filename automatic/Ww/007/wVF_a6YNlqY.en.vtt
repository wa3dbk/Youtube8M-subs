00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.630
 SIS maintain past friends on Facebook shares posted 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.050
 Instead taken violently out of context or completely fabricated by a crazy uncle 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.100
 Posted by Upton Sinclair to support Ron Do this 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.080
 In forty-seven percent captors C when Sinclair pointed out that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.910
 Social mccuen most certainly does not mean what he thought he meant it 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.500
 I ignored the historical context 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.150
 Uh later ... my sister exposed to the ten can not be falsely attributed to sanding can i 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.300
 We refer to the actress linked to say that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.730
 The huge cancer army told my mom that it does not matter until the quote is honest 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.540
 The Lincoln phone answer thing said 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.400
 This is just a hit taking the Brenham 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.300
 Hi get these messages all the time 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.430
 The first thing I did 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.530
 I am getting into my father's law 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.100
 With the first thing I did 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.650
 I got in people from the other but I've been removed from the menu is 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.330
 Mother ... 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.910
 They send out a couple of a bunch of people they do not know how to use hidden 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.640
 So the first thing I do is take one sentence of mail 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.260
 And iGoogle are 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.600
 Then go to the Snobs link that appears in different percentages 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.810
 And then find out that they were completely fabricated that there was none 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.740
 Glued by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Lt. Stephen Berg 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.330
 Who uh ... 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.150
 And 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.780
 Use it for the lack of a quick smart Steven Brier service 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.580
 Seventh to me it is still poor and Iraq 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.640
 Then I just called the Snobs and the like and I send it back to everyone 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 And then exit the e-mail EST 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.759
 So I do not know how the book face works I really do not lily III 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.400
 I did not have any I had asked Nicky to walk me through 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.360
 Like how I fix it and definitely protect the footage I have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.000
 Apply in more of the posters so in fact that I have a girl 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.119
 Feelings in the side 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.600
 The reluctant
