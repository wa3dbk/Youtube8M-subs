00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.570
 clear 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.290
 The topic of minimum wage will soon be earning everyone 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.670
 at least seven euros also like that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.960
 They puke one already now they have 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.189
 Now they are strong again 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 rescue screen is over they come 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.380
 opening mindestlohn who they in wild with 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 but the minimum wage still exists 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 Westerwelle is looking forward to Mallorca 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.119
 a villa bought for 1.9 million 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.310
 I ask so much money that deserves 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.930
 he has politicians with his girlfriend 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.549
 theme development of the world population 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.430
 Now we are seven billion 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.079
 That said I do not think so 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.110
 properly so they will then have about 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.140
 somehow be controlled against it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.820
 or what berlin and especially in africa the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.530
 the poor who throw 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.540
 every year a child that is not 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.280
 To be right one would have a planet 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.259
 you have to discover where you are practically with 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.060
 a rocket which people shoot out 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.840
 can be 500 each day to another 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 Plan on life conditions 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 It is right now in the glasshouse and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.280
 then they would practically have somehow 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.080
 But we did not have that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.209

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.019

 actually that healthy part I have 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.400

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.900
 it's trendy with what we have now 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 Today, they meet again in a couple of days 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.790

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.019
