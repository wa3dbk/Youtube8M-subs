side<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.809> chefs<00:00:42.809> four<00:00:42.930> ingredients<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
side so chefs four ingredients because I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
side so chefs four ingredients because I
can<00:00:44.010> probably<00:00:44.190> play<00:00:44.460> zone<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.690> gives

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
can probably play zone so it gives

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
don't know how to open it says lifts

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:49.870 
don't know how to open it says lifts
have<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.210> open<00:01:30.979> what<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> define<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.579> tab

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.800 

okay

okay
so<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.450> poured<00:02:00.840> few<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.360> they

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so so I just poured few out so they

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
so so I just poured few out so they
actually<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.720> local<00:02:04.079> bottle<00:02:04.409> caps<00:02:04.619> if<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.220> could

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
actually do local bottle caps if I could

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.419 
actually do local bottle caps if I could
move<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> closer<00:02:06.350> this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.310> says

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
move it closer this one up it just says

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.070 
move it closer this one up it just says
bottle<00:02:08.729> caps<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.450> could<00:02:09.509> see<00:02:09.720> focus

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
bottle caps on it if I could see focus

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.870 
bottle caps on it if I could see focus
but<00:02:10.619> probably<00:02:11.009> don't<00:02:11.130> need<00:02:13.519> yep<00:02:14.519> just<00:02:14.790> his

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
but probably don't need yep just his

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.440 
but probably don't need yep just his
bottle<00:02:15.150> caps<00:02:15.330> um<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.800> one's<00:02:16.980> orange<00:02:17.489> has<00:02:18.209> two
