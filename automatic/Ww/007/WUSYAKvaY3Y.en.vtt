of<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.880> some<00:02:14.030> negative<00:02:14.180> opinions<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
of have some negative opinions on the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.720 
of have some negative opinions on the
game<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> will<00:02:15.440> give<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.160> fact<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
game I will give you the fact that it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.580 
game I will give you the fact that it
does<00:02:16.940> look<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.510> futuristic<00:02:18.110> call<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.350> duty

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
does look like a futuristic call of duty

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.020 
does look like a futuristic call of duty
and<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.740> kind<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.190> feels<00:02:19.460> like<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.820> little

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and it kind of it feels like a little

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.760 
and it kind of it feels like a little
bit<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.300> futuristic<00:02:20.960> shooter<00:02:21.110> game<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:21.650> it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
bit of a futuristic shooter game but it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.950 
bit of a futuristic shooter game but it
is<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.920> very<00:02:22.430> different<00:02:23.030> Call<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.330> Duty<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> say

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
is a very different Call of Duty to say

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.270 
is a very different Call of Duty to say
the<00:02:24.020> least<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.410> think<00:02:24.590> that's<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.830> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
the least and I think that's a really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.310 
the least and I think that's a really
good<00:02:25.520> thing<00:02:25.820> with<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> swiping<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:27.080> lot

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
good thing with the swiping it's a lot

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.290 
good thing with the swiping it's a lot
different<00:02:27.860> from<00:02:27.890> any<00:02:28.520> Call<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.850> Duty<00:02:29.210> that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
different from any Call of Duty that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.130 
different from any Call of Duty that
we've<00:02:29.420> ever<00:02:29.570> seen<00:02:29.750> before

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
we've ever seen before

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.660 
we've ever seen before
as<00:02:30.320> for<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.650> trickshotting<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.250> sniping

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
as for like trickshotting and sniping

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.670 
as for like trickshotting and sniping
irie<00:02:32.180> actually<00:02:32.540> really<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.230> sniping<00:02:33.560> on

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
irie actually really like the sniping on

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.020 
irie actually really like the sniping on
this<00:02:33.800> game<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.130> actually<00:02:34.400> kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.820> hard

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
this game it's actually kind of hard

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.520 
this game it's actually kind of hard
it's<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.300> hard<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.810> get<00:02:35.960> used<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
it's really hard to get used to but I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.840 
it's really hard to get used to but I
think<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.860> good<00:02:36.950> thing<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.190> sniping<00:02:37.730> is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
think it's a good thing that sniping is

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.250 
think it's a good thing that sniping is
different<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.540> game<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:38.960> means

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
different on this game it just means

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.140 
different on this game it just means
that<00:02:39.410> people<00:02:39.470> aren't<00:02:40.100> automatically<00:02:40.760> beasts

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
that people aren't automatically beasts

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.850 
that people aren't automatically beasts
they<00:02:41.450> need<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.690> actually<00:02:42.020> learn<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.290> game<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
they need to actually learn the game and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.260 
they need to actually learn the game and
get<00:02:42.980> good<00:02:43.130> at<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.340> which<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:43.850> really<00:02:44.150> good

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
get good at it which is like really good

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.700 
get good at it which is like really good

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
bolt cipher it's kind of similar to the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.920 
bolt cipher it's kind of similar to the
ballista<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:18.830> guess<00:03:19.100> but<00:03:19.520> it<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.120> fucking

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
ballista I guess but it is so fucking

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.110 
ballista I guess but it is so fucking
cool<00:03:20.960> it<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.830> such<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.460> six<00:03:22.850> sniper

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
cool it is is such a like a six sniper

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.190 
cool it is is such a like a six sniper
to<00:03:23.300> use<00:03:23.420> for<00:03:23.630> trickshotting

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
to use for trickshotting

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.720 
to use for trickshotting
and<00:03:24.320> like<00:03:24.740> when<00:03:24.920> you<00:03:25.010> hit<00:03:25.220> somebody<00:03:25.430> with<00:03:25.610> a

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
and like when you hit somebody with a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.070 
and like when you hit somebody with a
trickshot<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.330> like<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> sound<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.960> it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
trickshot that like the sound that it
