flat ok so this goes on for quite a
while<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.670> then<00:00:55.910> we<00:00:56.480> get<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:56.870> board

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.889 

which<00:01:24.749> is<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:25.350> long<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.009> I've<00:01:26.600> wrote<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.749> out

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
which is quite long so I've wrote it out

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.740 
which is quite long so I've wrote it out
for<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> look<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
for you so if you take a look in the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.969 
for you so if you take a look in the
third<00:01:31.020> box<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.520> will<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:33.030> these<00:01:33.750> free<00:01:34.140> chords

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.999 

which<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.119> what<00:01:40.329> we'll<00:01:40.539> begin<00:01:40.719> with<00:01:40.990> now<00:01:41.320> these

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
which is what we'll begin with now these

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.340 
which is what we'll begin with now these
are<00:01:42.250> all<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.549> same<00:01:42.729> chords<00:01:43.179> as<00:01:43.329> we've<00:01:44.079> seen

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
are all the same chords as we've seen

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.770 
are all the same chords as we've seen
before<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:44.920> I'm<00:01:45.009> not<00:01:45.130> going<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.609> explain<00:01:46.570> them

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
before so I'm not going to explain them

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.169 
before so I'm not going to explain them
again<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.860> I'll<00:01:48.009> just<00:01:48.280> call<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.789> bottom

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
again so I'll just call the bottom

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.660 
again so I'll just call the bottom
letters<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> flat<00:01:50.289> B<00:01:50.500> flat<00:01:50.530> or<00:01:50.950> E<00:01:51.070> flat<00:01:51.310> in

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
letters so a flat B flat or E flat in

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.160 
letters so a flat B flat or E flat in
this<00:01:51.850> case<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.700> play<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.329> flat<00:01:55.780> chord

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
this case so you play the a flat chord

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.809 
this case so you play the a flat chord
twice<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:58.030> B<00:01:58.240> flat<00:01:58.569> chord<00:01:58.600> twice<00:01:58.959> and<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:00.789> E

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
twice the B flat chord twice and the E

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.840 
twice the B flat chord twice and the E
flat<00:02:01.179> chord<00:02:01.539> three<00:02:01.979> three<00:02:02.979> or<00:02:03.130> four<00:02:03.429> four

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
flat chord three three or four four

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.710 
flat chord three three or four four
times

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.290 

okay<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:07.780> two<00:02:08.530> two<00:02:09.010> and<00:02:09.280> four<00:02:09.520> times

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.070 

then<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.420> repeat<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.810> again

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.170 

and<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:24.860> get<00:02:25.099> this<00:02:25.250> part

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.050 

and<00:02:33.740> therefore<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.070> look<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
and therefore you have to look in the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.440 
and therefore you have to look in the
fourth<00:02:36.360> box<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.770> we<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.580> flat

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
fourth box so what we have is a flat

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.070 
fourth box so what we have is a flat
chord<00:02:39.720> twice<00:02:41.270> B<00:02:42.270> flat<00:02:42.570> chord<00:02:42.600> twice<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:45.080> flat

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
chord twice B flat chord twice a flat

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.390 
chord twice B flat chord twice a flat
chord<00:02:46.380> once<00:02:46.940> B<00:02:47.940> flat<00:02:48.209> chord<00:02:48.240> once<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:50.130> C

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
chord once B flat chord once and the C

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.630 
chord once B flat chord once and the C
chord<00:02:50.760> once

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.570 

and<00:02:54.050> then<00:02:55.050> you'll<00:02:55.200> keep<00:02:55.380> on<00:02:55.560> hanging<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.370> C

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
and then you'll keep on hanging on the C

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.790 
and then you'll keep on hanging on the C
chord<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.170> twice<00:02:59.090> twice<00:03:00.410> once<00:03:01.410> once<00:03:02.270> hanging

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.729 

and<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:08.330> we'll<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.930> very<00:03:09.140> last<00:03:09.230> part

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
and now we'll get to the very last part

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:23.490 
and now we'll get to the very last part
of<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.310> section<00:03:10.819> which<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.300> this

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.020 

so<00:03:24.500> what<00:03:24.680> you'll<00:03:24.920> do<00:03:25.099> here<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.549> you'll<00:03:25.790> play

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
so what you'll do here is you'll play

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.770 
so what you'll do here is you'll play
the<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.239> flat<00:03:26.840> chord<00:03:27.170> twice<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:29.269> B<00:03:29.480> flat<00:03:29.750> chord

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the a flat chord twice the B flat chord

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.160 
the a flat chord twice the B flat chord
twice<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.540> C<00:03:32.810> chord<00:03:33.170> four<00:03:33.799> times

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.370 

and<00:03:37.610> now<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.670> play<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.630> flat<00:03:39.930> chord<00:03:40.200> twice

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
and now you play the a flat chord twice

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.600 
and now you play the a flat chord twice
again<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.720> B<00:03:42.900> flat<00:03:43.050> chord<00:03:43.200> twice<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:47.580> E

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
again the B flat chord twice and the E

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.510 
again the B flat chord twice and the E
flat<00:03:47.940> chord<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.500> that's<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.890> entire<00:03:50.160> song

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
flat chord so that's the entire song

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.040 
flat chord so that's the entire song
