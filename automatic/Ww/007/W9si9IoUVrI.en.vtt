00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
shotting tutorial in this video I'm

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.990 
shotting tutorial in this video I'm
going<00:00:14.230> to<00:00:14.289> show<00:00:14.410> you<00:00:14.500> guys<00:00:14.620> how<00:00:15.010> to<00:00:15.039> do<00:00:15.400> the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
going to show you guys how to do the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.570 
going to show you guys how to do the
infinite<00:00:16.539> /<00:00:16.840> infinity<00:00:17.350> fatal<00:00:17.740> black<00:00:17.920> ops<00:00:18.160> 2

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
infinite / infinity fatal black ops 2

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.950 
infinite / infinity fatal black ops 2
I<00:00:18.609> believe<00:00:19.119> this<00:00:19.240> shot<00:00:19.449> has<00:00:19.539> been<00:00:19.600> around

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
I believe this shot has been around

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.189 
I believe this shot has been around
since<00:00:20.260> the<00:00:20.500> mw2<00:00:21.070> days<00:00:21.550> but<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.510> black<00:00:22.779> ops<00:00:23.050> 2

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
since the mw2 days but the black ops 2

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.070 
since the mw2 days but the black ops 2
version<00:00:23.529> looks<00:00:23.800> so<00:00:24.220> clean<00:00:24.519> so<00:00:24.789> first<00:00:25.599> off<00:00:26.050> you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
version looks so clean so first off you

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.429 
version looks so clean so first off you
have<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.890> get<00:00:27.550> your<00:00:27.759> DSR<00:00:28.419> out<00:00:28.570> obviously<00:00:29.199> and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
have to get your DSR out obviously and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.069 
have to get your DSR out obviously and
get<00:00:29.949> a<00:00:30.130> bullet<00:00:30.460> out<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:31.089> the<00:00:31.210> clip<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:31.720> it's<00:00:31.869> not

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
get a bullet out of the clip so it's not

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.500 
get a bullet out of the clip so it's not
at<00:00:32.230> full<00:00:32.439> ammo<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.940> do<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.180> shot<00:00:34.390> it's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
at full ammo and to do the shot it's

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.580 
at full ammo and to do the shot it's
actually<00:00:34.810> really<00:00:34.900> simple<00:00:35.140> I'm<00:00:35.380> gonna<00:00:35.500> show

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
actually really simple I'm gonna show

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.290 
actually really simple I'm gonna show
you<00:00:35.680> guys<00:00:35.739> how<00:00:35.829> to<00:00:36.070> do<00:00:36.280> this<00:00:36.430> with<00:00:36.790> these<00:00:37.000> scuff

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
you guys how to do this with these scuff

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.090 
you guys how to do this with these scuff
first<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:38.140> obviously<00:00:38.500> you<00:00:38.620> want<00:00:38.650> your<00:00:38.920> right

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
first so obviously you want your right

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.299 
first so obviously you want your right
paddle<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.699> be<00:00:39.820> set<00:00:40.059> as<00:00:40.239> Y<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.980> want<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
paddle to be set as Y and you want to

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.950 
paddle to be set as Y and you want to
hold<00:00:42.550> down<00:00:42.670> reload<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.329> shoot<00:00:43.539> at<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.750> same

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
hold down reload and shoot at the same

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.229 
hold down reload and shoot at the same
time<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.379> press<00:00:44.620> Y<00:00:44.859> Y<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.670> you<00:00:45.850> see<00:00:46.030> right<00:00:46.059> there

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
time to press Y Y so you see right there

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.299 
time to press Y Y so you see right there
that<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:47.019> infinite<00:00:47.440> slash<00:00:47.769> infinity

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
that is the infinite slash infinity

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.400 
that is the infinite slash infinity
phase<00:00:48.519> shot<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.570> bullet<00:00:49.690> count<00:00:50.050> does<00:00:50.230> not

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
phase shot and the bullet count does not

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.529 
phase shot and the bullet count does not
go<00:00:50.620> down<00:00:50.649> or<00:00:51.039> up<00:00:51.219> whatsoever<00:00:51.760> because<00:00:52.179> you're

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
go down or up whatsoever because you're

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.000 
go down or up whatsoever because you're
canceling<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.170> shot<00:00:53.410> doesn't<00:00:53.649> actually

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
canceling the shot doesn't actually

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.819 
canceling the shot doesn't actually
register<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.789> bullet<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.530> go<00:00:56.620> for<00:00:56.769> the

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
register the bullet and to go for the

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.439 
register the bullet and to go for the
shot<00:00:57.010> actually<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:57.519> simple<00:00:57.850> if<00:00:57.969> you<00:00:58.120> go<00:00:58.269> for

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
shot actually so simple if you go for

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.090 
shot actually so simple if you go for
this<00:00:58.539> variation<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.469> mine<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.920> I'm<00:01:00.010> gonna

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
this variation of mine and I'm gonna

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.680 
this variation of mine and I'm gonna
show<00:01:00.339> you<00:01:00.399> guys<00:01:00.489> this<00:01:00.789> variation<00:01:01.390> because

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
show you guys this variation because

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.990 
show you guys this variation because
it's<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.500> simplest<00:01:02.949> one<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.219> can<00:01:03.489> come<00:01:03.670> up<00:01:03.699> with

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
it's the simplest one I can come up with

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's the simplest one I can come up with
I<00:01:04.210> haven't<00:01:04.570> really<00:01:04.930> perfected<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:05.890> class

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
I haven't really perfected this class

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.250 
I haven't really perfected this class
yet<00:01:06.490> if<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.760> will<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.180> yeah<00:01:08.050> that's<00:01:08.230> pretty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
yet if you will and yeah that's pretty

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.710 
yet if you will and yeah that's pretty
much<00:01:08.440> it<00:01:08.800> with<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.280> scuff<00:01:09.700> version<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.390> my

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
much it with the scuff version and my

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.920 
much it with the scuff version and my
phone<00:01:11.050> just<00:01:11.350> got<00:01:11.650> a<00:01:11.860> text<00:01:12.490> but<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.509> claw

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
phone just got a text but with the claw

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.770 
phone just got a text but with the claw
on<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.829> regular<00:01:15.759> controller<00:01:16.180> it's<00:01:16.390> actually

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
on the regular controller it's actually

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
on the regular controller it's actually
really<00:01:17.020> easy<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.320> go<00:01:17.409> for<00:01:17.560> this<00:01:17.650> as<00:01:17.770> well<00:01:18.009> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
really easy to go for this as well and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.440 
really easy to go for this as well and
as<00:01:19.240> like<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.140> tip<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.619> guess<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.220> easier<00:01:21.790> if<00:01:22.180> you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
as like a tip I guess it's easier if you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.840 
as like a tip I guess it's easier if you
have<00:01:22.720> control<00:01:23.320> freaks<00:01:23.590> because<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.549> does

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
have control freaks because it does

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.719 
have control freaks because it does
extend<00:01:25.390> your<00:01:25.899> analog<00:01:26.590> stick<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.040> lot<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.549> it's

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
extend your analog stick a lot so it's

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.429 
extend your analog stick a lot so it's
easier<00:01:28.000> for<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.270> spin<00:01:28.509> left<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:29.110> if<00:01:29.409> you

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
easier for you to spin left and if you

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.109 
easier for you to spin left and if you
guys<00:01:29.619> know<00:01:29.799> how<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:29.979> do<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.369> shot<00:01:30.670> spinning

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
guys know how to do this shot spinning

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.550 
guys know how to do this shot spinning
right<00:01:31.299> please<00:01:31.570> tell<00:01:31.869> me<00:01:31.990> how<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.170> do<00:01:32.290> because<00:01:32.439> I

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
right please tell me how to do because I

don't know how and submit a response if
you<00:01:35.140> have<00:01:36.040> seen<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.490> guide<00:01:36.729> on<00:01:37.180> YouTube<00:01:37.659> that

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
you have seen the guide on YouTube that

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.469 
you have seen the guide on YouTube that
does<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.320> spinning<00:01:38.740> right<00:01:39.040> but<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:40.180> do<00:01:40.299> this

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
does it spinning right but to do this

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.819 
does it spinning right but to do this
obviously<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.990> want<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> have<00:01:41.469> your<00:01:41.680> middle

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
obviously you want to have your middle

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.459 
obviously you want to have your middle
finger<00:01:42.159> on<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.310> trigger<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:43.030> your<00:01:43.689> thumb<00:01:44.200> on

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
finger on the trigger and your thumb on
