all right this is the second update I'm
putting<00:00:04.110> out<00:00:04.230> there<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> modify

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
putting out there this is how to modify

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.920 
putting out there this is how to modify
the<00:00:05.609> timers<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.330> some<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.750> guys<00:00:06.870> are

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the timers that some of you guys are

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.730 
the timers that some of you guys are
finding<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:08.130> they<00:00:08.370> don't<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.740> mechanism

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
finding that they don't have a mechanism

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740 
finding that they don't have a mechanism
that<00:00:10.950> looks<00:00:11.130> like<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> other<00:00:11.550> video<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.599> is

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
that looks like the other video this is

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.360 
that looks like the other video this is
the<00:00:12.870> other<00:00:13.019> type<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.320> mechanism<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.250> you're

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the other type of mechanism that you're

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.150 
the other type of mechanism that you're
going<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> find<00:00:14.759> out<00:00:14.910> there<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> inside<00:00:16.160> it

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
going to find out there on the inside it

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.450 
going to find out there on the inside it
has<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:19.140> top<00:00:19.560> gear<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.340> way

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
has to do with the the top gear the way

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.120 
has to do with the the top gear the way
it<00:00:20.609> rotates<00:00:21.000> inside<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.600> gear<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.619> one's<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it rotates inside a gear this one's a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
it rotates inside a gear this one's a
little<00:00:23.220> easier<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.000> modify<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.289> I'm<00:00:25.590> gonna

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
little easier to modify so I'm gonna

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.810 
little easier to modify so I'm gonna
pull<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.130> box<00:00:26.340> show<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the internal gears if you need to figure

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.649 
the internal gears if you need to figure
out<00:01:29.280> how<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.759> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
out how to do that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.690 
out how to do that
just<00:01:31.079> watch<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> other<00:01:31.470> video<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.460> actually

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
just watch the other video it's actually

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.190 
just watch the other video it's actually
easy<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.240> pop<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> flip<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> tabs<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> once

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
easy just pop and flip the tabs so once

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.910 
easy just pop and flip the tabs so once
you<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:39.020> if<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.170> keep<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> gears

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
you do that if you keep all the gears

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
you do that if you keep all the gears
and<00:01:41.280> axles<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.329> side<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:43.799> should<00:01:43.979> have

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and axles on one side you should have

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.899 
and axles on one side you should have
something<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.759> nice<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.909> unless

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
something really nice like that unless

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.929 
something really nice like that unless
y'all<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> real<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.840> look<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.939> now

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
y'all get a real good look at that now

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.160 
y'all get a real good look at that now
the<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:52.850> magnetic<00:01:53.850> motor<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the little magnetic motor is going to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
the little magnetic motor is going to
sit<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.960> usually<00:01:57.960> keep<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
sit right here I usually keep it in the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.260 
sit right here I usually keep it in the
housing<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.430> but<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.030> need<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
mess with are these top three gears I'm

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.900 
mess with are these top three gears I'm
going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.030> try<00:02:06.180> point<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.849> this<00:02:08.849> one<00:02:10.910> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
going to try point at it this one that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.130 
going to try point at it this one that
one

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
one

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.820 
one
and<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.050> want<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.560> pull

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and that one so if you want you can pull

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.380 
and that one so if you want you can pull
those<00:02:17.069> out<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.790> I'm<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.030> tell<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.270> what

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
those out and I'm going to tell you what

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.930 
those out and I'm going to tell you what
we're<00:02:18.480> gonna<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:19.370> now<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> show

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
we're gonna do now I'm not going to show

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.890 
we're gonna do now I'm not going to show
you<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.180> I'm<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.630> show<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
you this I'm just going to show you the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.620 
you this I'm just going to show you the
end<00:02:22.050> result<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.470> you're<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.860> cut<00:02:23.630> this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
end result but you're going to cut this

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.990 
end result but you're going to cut this
top<00:02:25.430> smaller<00:02:26.430> gear<00:02:26.880> off<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:28.170> plate<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
top smaller gear off this plate and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.699 
top smaller gear off this plate and
you're<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.440> too

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
you're going to do that on this one too

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.780 
you're going to do that on this one too
and<00:02:33.620> then<00:02:34.620> you're<00:02:34.740> going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> sand<00:02:35.280> those<00:02:35.520> two

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and then you're going to sand those two

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.870 
and then you're going to sand those two
gears<00:02:36.090> smooth<00:02:36.630> okay<00:02:37.370> what<00:02:38.370> we're<00:02:38.520> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.670> do

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
gears smooth okay what we're going to do

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.130 
gears smooth okay what we're going to do
is<00:02:39.060> we're<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.390> glue<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:41.400> gear<00:02:42.140> once

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
is we're going to glue this gear once

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.830 
is we're going to glue this gear once
it's<00:02:43.350> flat<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.830> smooth<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.300> bottom<00:02:45.660> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
it's flat and smooth to the bottom of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's flat and smooth to the bottom of
this<00:02:46.290> gear<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.900> then<00:02:48.900> we're<00:02:49.380> gonna<00:02:49.470> put<00:02:49.739> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
this gear and then we're gonna put a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.940 
this gear and then we're gonna put a
rubber<00:02:50.670> washer<00:02:51.890> between<00:02:52.890> these<00:02:53.760> two<00:02:54.030> gears<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
rubber washer between these two gears so

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.400 
rubber washer between these two gears so
that<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.220> end<00:02:56.430> up<00:02:56.610> with<00:02:56.970> something<00:03:00.410> that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
that you end up with something that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.790 
that you end up with something that
looks<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:03.950> if<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:07.590> is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
looks like that if you can see this is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.460 
looks like that if you can see this is
that<00:03:07.980> bottom<00:03:08.400> gear<00:03:08.640> I've<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:10.080> cut<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
that bottom gear I've just cut the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.120 
that bottom gear I've just cut the
little<00:03:11.250> smaller<00:03:11.550> top<00:03:11.940> gear<00:03:12.180> off<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.130> same

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
little smaller top gear off it and same

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.509 
little smaller top gear off it and same
thing<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:15.000> right<00:03:15.030> here<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.519> then

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
thing with this one right here and then

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.840 
thing with this one right here and then
I've<00:03:17.670> glued<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.269> whole<00:03:18.540> thing<00:03:18.810> together<00:03:19.019> and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
I've glued this whole thing together and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.110 
I've glued this whole thing together and
it<00:03:20.850> basically<00:03:21.420> makes<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:22.320> solid<00:03:23.190> gear<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.790> it

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
it basically makes one solid gear and it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.560 
it basically makes one solid gear and it
changes<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.549> reduction<00:03:26.549> down<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.239> it's

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
changes the reduction down so that it's

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.930 
changes the reduction down so that it's
not<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:28.019> slow<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.950> actually<00:03:29.340> sped<00:03:29.579> up<00:03:29.730> quite

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
not as slow it's actually sped up quite

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.979 
not as slow it's actually sped up quite
a<00:03:30.030> bit<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.640> can<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.060> top<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.810> still

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
a bit and you can see the top is still

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.150 
a bit and you can see the top is still
the<00:03:34.230> same<00:03:34.470> you're<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> put<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.760> little

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the same you're going to put that little

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.890 
the same you're going to put that little
piece<00:03:38.160> right<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:40.489> back<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.700> top<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:45.000> it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
piece right here back on top and it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.860 
piece right here back on top and it
should<00:03:46.049> still<00:03:46.350> move<00:03:46.530> pretty<00:03:46.799> freely<00:03:47.690> but<00:03:48.690> now

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
should still move pretty freely but now

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.050 
should still move pretty freely but now
you<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> solid<00:03:49.739> gear<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.579> have<00:03:53.760> this

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
you have the solid gear so you have this

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.890 
you have the solid gear so you have this
you<00:03:54.920> know<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.130> here<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.640> you<00:04:00.600> can<00:04:00.750> see

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
you know right here and you can see

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.660 
you know right here and you can see
that's<00:04:01.049> all<00:04:01.380> those<00:04:01.620> three<00:04:01.890> gears<00:04:02.160> we've<00:04:02.430> just

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
that's all those three gears we've just

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.190 
that's all those three gears we've just
glued<00:04:02.910> them<00:04:03.030> together<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.810> know<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.019> had<00:04:04.110> to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
glued them together you know we had to

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.520 
glued them together you know we had to
modify<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.980> little<00:04:05.010> bit<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.380> just

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
modify in just a little bit and you just

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.260 
modify in just a little bit and you just
drop<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.220> there

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:25.820 

just<00:04:13.840> give<00:04:13.990> you<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.110> comparison<00:04:14.770> here<00:04:22.920> original

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
just give you a comparison here original

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.290 
just give you a comparison here original
new

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.620 

so<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.200> see<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:35.040> gear<00:04:35.480> there's<00:04:36.480> no

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
so you can see that that gear there's no

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.920 
so you can see that that gear there's no
longer<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.110> one<00:04:37.350> gear<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.600> second<00:04:39.600> axle

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
longer that one gear on the second axle

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.860 
longer that one gear on the second axle
from<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.170> far<00:04:40.380> left<00:04:40.680> it's<00:04:40.950> now<00:04:41.300> been<00:04:42.300> moved<00:04:42.600> to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
from the far left it's now been moved to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.070 
from the far left it's now been moved to
the<00:04:42.960> first<00:04:43.140> axle<00:04:43.680> on<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.010> far<00:04:44.430> left

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
the first axle on the far left

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.100 
the first axle on the far left
maybe<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.290> far<00:04:46.500> right<00:04:46.740> on<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.070> camera<00:04:48.110> but

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
maybe the far right on the camera but

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.390 
maybe the far right on the camera but
that's<00:04:49.290> what<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.530> want<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.770> do<00:04:49.860> right<00:04:50.130> there

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that's what you want to do right there

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.970 
that's what you want to do right there
okay<00:04:51.050> if<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.140> have<00:04:52.260> any<00:04:52.380> questions<00:04:52.770> how<00:04:52.920> we

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
okay if you have any questions how we

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.710 
okay if you have any questions how we
did<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.430> just<00:04:53.580> go<00:04:53.760> watch<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.180> first<00:04:54.390> video

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
did this just go watch the first video
