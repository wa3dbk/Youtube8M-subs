right abilities and you also have to
sort<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.690> practice<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.260> figure<00:03:38.500> out<00:03:38.560> how<00:03:38.710> the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
sort of practice and figure out how the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.710 
sort of practice and figure out how the
controls<00:03:39.220> work<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:39.790> what<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.240> can<00:03:40.390> do<00:03:40.540> with

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
controls work and what you can do with

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.770 
controls work and what you can do with
the<00:03:40.810> character<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:42.580> you'll<00:03:42.970> have<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.300> learn<00:03:43.480> to

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
the character so you'll have to learn to

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.740 
the character so you'll have to learn to
use<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:43.960> wii<00:03:44.620> controller<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.190> nunchuck<00:03:45.850> you

know<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.140> weekend<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:47.740> we<00:03:47.860> really<00:03:48.160> wanted

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
know it's a weekend so we really wanted

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.590 
know it's a weekend so we really wanted
to<00:03:48.460> make<00:03:48.700> sure<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:49.000> we're<00:03:49.120> really<00:03:49.300> taking

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
to make sure that we're really taking

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.140 
to make sure that we're really taking
advantage<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.040> controls<00:03:51.490> as<00:03:51.730> much<00:03:51.970> as

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
advantage of all the controls as much as

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.870 
advantage of all the controls as much as
possible<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:53.290> that's<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.130> we<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.610> went<00:03:54.760> out

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
possible so that's it we really went out

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.450 
possible so that's it we really went out
of<00:03:55.120> with<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.420> combat<00:03:55.780> which<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.470> also<00:03:56.740> why<00:03:57.190> we

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
of with the combat which is also why we

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.260 
of with the combat which is also why we
decided<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:58.210> have<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.690> whole<00:04:00.030> versus<00:04:01.030> mode

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
decided to have this whole versus mode

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.530 
decided to have this whole versus mode
that<00:04:01.870> we<00:04:02.020> came<00:04:02.170> up<00:04:02.230> with
