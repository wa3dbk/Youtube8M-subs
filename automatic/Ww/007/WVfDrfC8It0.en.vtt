00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 how are you doing and today we are going to do 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.660
 a recipe that will allow you to succeed 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.880
 a spectacular way are the machines and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.650
 you will see how easy it is for it 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 we have to heat first the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 oven to 200 degrees and now let's go to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:23.029
 through the tulip ingredients 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:28.070
 sugar flour yeast yogurt milk 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 eggs raisins and cherries raisins 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:37.280
 we will start mixing tulip with the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.280
 sugar in the blender add tulip 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.230
 we will start at moderate speed 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.950
 we continue and add the eggs 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.730
 beat until the dough is 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 homogeneous 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.189
 while we are going to disperse the yeast 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.189
 in the flour 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.380
 we started by adding the little flour to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.380
 little to the mix 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.570
 trying to make the dough homogeneous 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.750
 the dough is perfectly homogeneous 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.470
 thanks to the tulip texture 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 we stopped 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.190
 and we are going to add milk and yogurt 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.190
 we add without first beating the milk 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.870
 we beat slowly 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.380
 so that the milk is integrated into 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 the mass we increase the speed 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.680
 the dough is perfectly integrated 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.680
 we take out the bowl 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.270
 we make sure that in the background 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 from the bowl there is no part of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.930
 no ingredient that has not been 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 mixed we add the yogurt 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.640
 we started to integrate it 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.220
 yogurt will also give us flavor 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.220
 sponginess 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.030
 we mix well 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.720
 we add raisins and cherries 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.120
 you pass and we mix and mix it 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.670
 everything perfectly so that we have left 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.379
 perfect delicious muffins and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.099
 also fluffy and soft thanks to 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.720
 Tulip and finally we will see well 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.310
 to fill our mobiles for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.940
 muffins or for muffins that comes to 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.790
 be the same then we take the dough and 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.739
 we introduce it in the molds up to three 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.709
 quarters of your volume because then 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.480
 remember that in the oven they will go up 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.040
 once we have the molds filled 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.019
 up to three quarters of its volume as 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.459
 we had commented we are going to 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.490
 place the oven in the oven 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.620
 we have 200 degrees 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.620
 and we introduce the muffins 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.660
 and we just have to wait for 20 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.820
 25 minutes 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.410
 and after 25 minutes let's see how 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.410
 our delicious muffins have been left 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.380
 carefully remove the tray 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.740
 and there we have the magnificent result what 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.140
 we let cool to then add a 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.330
 little bit of icing sugar and finally only 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.700
 we have to decorate the muffins for it 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.610
 we can help smaller there 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.920
 We have icing sugar and we're going to 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.590
 sprinkle over then the only thing 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.170
 what we have to do is simply 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.930
 make the icing sugar fall by way of 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.610
 snow above these muffins and 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.370
 finally there we have our muffins 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.570
 super juicy super fluffy and super 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.830
 tasty with tulip 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.830
