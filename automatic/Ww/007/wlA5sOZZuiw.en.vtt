00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.500
 hello dear intercepted readers from us 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.170
 want you a very special one today 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.140
 iphone protective cover for the 5 and 5 s 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.439
 imagine the fw33 two full 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.080
 there from friday 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:24.320
 cost 52 euros that is quite a lot for it 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.330
 you get it sent as unique 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.900
 similar to firefighters with whole 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.270
 own colors and gradients and it 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.120
 is a fold up here 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.980
 You can see once to the left and once 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.320
 to the right then is the bells and you 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.420
 look here so metal struts the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.910
 show everyone at the detail have the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 such a band as protection and the iphone 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.730
 you just stand up or down 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.290
 purely 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.300
 I thought that it was difficult 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.360
 could possibly scratch on the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.790
 reason of these metal struts up there though 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.610
 not used on the weekend several times 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.579
 pure pushed out and five, however 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.020
 completely new yes you see here then 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.059
 it works simply part of it 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.690
 magnets and then it is already 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.670
 pretty flat and a bit further 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.290
 show it here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.650
 Not all switches are accessible 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.090
 the vibration switch on the left fits 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.470
 not and you can order her one time 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 a bit high and underline if 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.280
 the camera will not turn out yet 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.890
 one should love to use one 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.420
 Both sides of the driver fold behind 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.060
 Note, of course, okay it's a bit 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 but fat man discovers it too 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.729
 a little flap we will give you now 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.369
 here again in detail show and with 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.040
 this camera a lot and indeed 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.439
 is that there for you was the back 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.950
 to hold and then you can be iphone 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.770
 this is convenient to put up 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.990
 Example between first line if one 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.150
 wants to watch videos in landscape format 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.150
 and do not want to keep the iphone 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.560
 altogether in any case very funny 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.250
 a matter of high quality in any case 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.229
 processed 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.360
 but I always finds annoying twice 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.829
 to have to fold out before I mine 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.759
 Therefore, it is possible to use iphone 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.759
 unfortunately nothing for me
