00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.160
 Huawei 510 as we are all waiting 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.840
 said update the update is 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.589
 has become known in recent times 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.109
 which has been postulated by him 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.750
 the cook 2 or which as always 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.790
 is optimal to leave us that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.600
 update first what we're going 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.370
 to do is go to the google page and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.239
 put our device 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.000
 huawei of 510 and then htc mania 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.940
 we give it a whole and soon we will 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.190
 will open in the search section 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.250
 let's find where you say rooms 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.230
 development for huawei 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 we wait for him to load between 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.070
 major issues that we can 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.170
 find in this in this new 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.420
 update is a greater management 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.360
 memory management since I have 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 tested in these three weeks and this 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.290
 device has run me to the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.970
 perfection although in some moments I was 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.380
 It gives certain certain 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 compilations of the system and certain 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.479
 restarts but lately the phone 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.070
 I've been more fluid than before what 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.830
 first we have to take into account is 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.570
 that you have to have root access and the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.000
 most of us should already have or 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.880
 if we do not have it, we should go to the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.820
 certain trays of options that we can 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.500
 find on the htc mania page on 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.020
 where can we find here where 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.790
 you will get the bot lara code which 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.530
 will help us to be able to get 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.179
 our root access the installation of the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.320
 recovery and after this we can 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.560
 find the room for our 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.020
 device like and we can find 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.869
 varieties rooms what we can do is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.600

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.690

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.870

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.280
 that download people send to a 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.040

 be able to download the apps from the gaps 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.050
 complete to the minimum glasses 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.000
 this system is not surrounded so what 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.000
 What we should do is download the zip 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.870
 to be able to root also brings us the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.140
 recovery of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.090
 inflatable copper face flower in the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.940
 which will help us to be able to manage 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.920
 better our files and finally we 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.720
 bring the update of the re covers and 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.049
 just in case we do not have in the last 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.180
 version since they say that from the 2.6 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.030
 this is going to run perfectly 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.730
 system but to be 100% 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.140
 sure that the system will be running 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.110
 it is better not to risk 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.300
 install the 2.8 point 0 1 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.070
 once we have this we are going to go 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.270
 next to where it says we go to the mode 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 recovery of our device we give 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.090
 two vizcachas we give them status without 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.780
 forecast and look for the rom e 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.549
 we installed the rumba we installed the gaps 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.700
 once we have this we give you another 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.700
 time 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.880
 clint the cachet once done this we 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.570
 we go again to facilities and card and 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.000
 we put it on the side we look for the root and 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.449
 we fix it and it's done once we have 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.910
 these steps we give you the reboot system and 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.620
 we hope the devices will not take a 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.250
 Approximate time five minutes in 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.250
 restart
