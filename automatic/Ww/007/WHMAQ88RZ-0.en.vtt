can't<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> those<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:19.230> right

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
can't get one of those here all right

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
can't get one of those here all right
let's<00:00:20.130> take<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> look<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> radio<00:00:21.270> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
let's take a look at what the radio is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.960 
let's take a look at what the radio is
doing<00:00:21.539> first<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.740> here<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.460> meter<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
doing first up here on the want meter I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.349 
doing first up here on the want meter I
got<00:00:24.810> 10<00:00:25.080> watts<00:00:25.320> across<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.769> top<00:00:25.980> scale<00:00:26.359> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
got 10 watts across the top scale and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.370 
got 10 watts across the top scale and
high<00:00:28.019> powers<00:00:28.439> 5<00:00:28.740> watts<00:00:29.480> as<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.810> drop<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.349> down

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
high powers 5 watts as I drop it down

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.940 
high powers 5 watts as I drop it down
goes<00:00:34.380> down<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:35.660> over<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> lot<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.829> go
