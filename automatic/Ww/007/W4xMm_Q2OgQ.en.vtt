00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.680
 only friends like this one I do not bring them a 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.730
 recipe to make a rich bread 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.510
 sponge that is the one to make cakes and 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.700
 this recipe is very easy and it is not 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.190
 so hard to make it 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.130
 This is I am going to explain step by step 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.810
 so they understand me to start 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.180
 water the ingredients that have to 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.870
 use that are this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.770
 what they will use are going to be 6 eggs 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:46.019
 they will use 200 grams of sugar 100 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.140
 milliliters of water 100 oil and 200 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.510
 grams of flour that those are going to be the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.479
 ingredients that will use what 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.850
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.370
 get us to put the eggs to beat together 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.409
 with our sugar we stir everything 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.100
 we put together and put it in speed 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:08.700
 high or third this we have it more or 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 less an approximate of 5 minutes or until 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.070
 10 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.030
 that mixture of sugar when the egg 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.760
 has to go up going to see for 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.130
 appear as spit 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.760
 after we upload we will add 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.430
 water and oil 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.620
 but at a lower speed they go to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.230
 put your blender in first adversity 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.600
 to put the water and the oil once 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.990
 that they have put water and oil 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 This is going to have a one minute beat 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 approximately 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.259
 since they have beaten that minute they are going to 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.300
 put the flour the flour they have it 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.180
 what to put fast 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.870
 this is put in one shot all 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.470
 of all the flour and beat it in about 15 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.200
 seconds approximately 20 if many do not 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.990
 you have to lower the mixture too much to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.180
 that they fit the bread well if they beat it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.850
 too much will be hard for them but 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.100
 they beat enough will be very 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.140
 porous and when you put your syrup 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.390
 three milks just like they're going to 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.330
 wet 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.940
 This is going to drain, then later 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.190
 you have done your mix well I'm going 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.750
 to have in your molds good in your mold 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.360
 because what is going to come out to break 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.069
 nothing else this is the recipe for a bread and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.170
 they pour it into their mold previously 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.360
 greased if they want they can flour it 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.730
 also this so that they do not stick 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.959
 nothing 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.430
 and this is put to know if your oven 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.359
 has this 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.159
 thermometer at 230 degrees if they are not going to 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.450
 sew on a stove well I'm not 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.719
 too strong to not be 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.540
 burn is better a little lower half more or 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:54.530
 less the fire 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.630
 and this to know if it is already cooked 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.010
 touch in the bread touches us in the part of 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.980
 up that I do not slowly yes 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.579
 his bread that is the fruit of 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.799
 the lack that the coso another little if when 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.099
 they crush it returns this now yes that 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.930
 the bread belly this means that 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.610
 it's already well cooked it has to have 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.700
 a more or less golden color left them 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.150
 some pictures of how is mine and this 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.099
 Well, do you have any doubt this leave the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.450
