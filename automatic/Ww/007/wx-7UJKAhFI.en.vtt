in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.810> new<00:00:18.930> car<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.160> has<00:00:20.310> more<00:00:20.580> power<00:00:20.820> it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
in the new car so it has more power it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.890 
in the new car so it has more power it
uses<00:00:22.140> less<00:00:22.320> fuel<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.189> cleaner<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:24.330> the

uses less fuel and it's cleaner with the

uses less fuel and it's cleaner with the
mixture<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> gasoline<00:00:26.340> I've<00:00:27.029> kind<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.390> very

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
mixture of gasoline I've kind of very

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
mixture of gasoline I've kind of very
important<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> fight<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.279> presumably<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
important to fight and presumably you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.870 
important to fight and presumably you
achieve<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.890> by<00:00:31.890> allowing<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.399> rev<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
achieve that by allowing the rev the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080 
achieve that by allowing the rev the
engine<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.420> Rev<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.079> higher<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:35.090> or

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
engine to Rev a little bit higher or or

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
engine to Rev a little bit higher or or
it's<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.780> efficient<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.410> high<00:00:37.559> revs

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it's just more efficient at high revs
