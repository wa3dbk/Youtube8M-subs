these are shiny CV deeds they don't make

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.299 
these are shiny CV deeds they don't make
them<00:00:10.260> anymore<00:00:10.469> -<00:00:10.860> probably<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:12.590> 2000<00:00:13.590> 2001

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.910 
them anymore - probably from 2000 2001
they're<00:00:14.700> old<00:00:14.910> now<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.230> downgrade<00:00:16.470> it

they're old now I have to downgrade it
with<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.340> plain<00:00:17.460> steel<00:00:17.880> ones<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.449> used<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
with just a plain steel ones I used the

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.080 
with just a plain steel ones I used the
heavy<00:00:20.789> duty<00:00:21.180> ones<00:00:21.390> last<00:00:21.720> week<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> telescope

heavy duty ones last week to telescope

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.800 
heavy duty ones last week to telescope
in<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.330> pee<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:25.680> sucked<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.460> axles<00:00:26.939> they

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
in my pee and they sucked the axles they

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
in my pee and they sucked the axles they
don't<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> pin<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.980> more<00:00:29.160> like

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
don't have a pin in them it's more like

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
don't have a pin in them it's more like
a<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.580> keyed<00:00:29.820> axle<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.990> tighten<00:00:31.439> your

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
a bit keyed axle so you tighten your

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.229 
a bit keyed axle so you tighten your
wheel<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.189> little<00:00:32.759> along<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:34.320> wheel<00:00:34.500> hex<00:00:35.239> out

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
wheel a little along the wheel hex out

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.280 
wheel a little along the wheel hex out
make<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> noise<00:00:37.440> wheel<00:00:38.129> hex<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:39.570> goes<00:00:39.750> over<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
make a noise wheel hex it goes over it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
make a noise wheel hex it goes over it
right<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.890> tighten<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.250> wheel<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:42.000> wheel

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
right and tighten your wheel your wheel

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.030 
right and tighten your wheel your wheel
hex<00:00:42.450> moves<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.440> key<00:00:43.680> there's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
hex moves because it's just key there's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
hex moves because it's just key there's
no<00:00:44.160> pin<00:00:44.430> holding<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> factory<00:00:45.600> one

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
no pin holding it like the factory one

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.799 
no pin holding it like the factory one
has<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.800> slot<00:00:47.070> mat<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> when<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> do

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
has a little slot mat so when you do

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.970 
has a little slot mat so when you do
that<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.960> find<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.170> axle<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.829> it's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that the thing find your axle so it's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.540 
that the thing find your axle so it's
junk

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
junk

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.080 
junk
so<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.960> got<00:00:55.260> our<00:00:55.590> old<00:00:56.280> ones<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:56.879> loose

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so now we got our old ones they're loose

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
so now we got our old ones they're loose
is<00:00:57.300> held<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.719> worn<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.710> pin<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
is held or worn out a little pin the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
is held or worn out a little pin the
worn-out<00:00:59.460> Drive<00:01:00.420> cups<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.899> worn<00:01:01.079> out

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
worn-out Drive cups you're worn out

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.609 
worn-out Drive cups you're worn out
everything<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.739> worn<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:03.229> we<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> these

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
everything is worn out and we got these

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.620 
everything is worn out and we got these
I<00:01:04.680> noticed<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.090> tick<00:01:06.950> shorter

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
I noticed these are just a tick shorter

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
I noticed these are just a tick shorter
than<00:01:09.630> me<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.380> hope<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
than me so I hope that it's not a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.980 
than me so I hope that it's not a
problem

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
problem

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.969 
problem
next<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> might<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.430> good<00:01:14.700> though<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.150> on

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
next you might be good though because on

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.480 
next you might be good though because on
suspension<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.450> able<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.049> be

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
suspension with it you not be able to be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.450 
suspension with it you not be able to be
compressed<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.909> I'd<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.450> stock<00:01:21.869> piece

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
compressed more I'd like to stock piece

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.410 
compressed more I'd like to stock piece
yes<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.640> definitely<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.240> bit

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
yes there definitely a little bit

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
yes there definitely a little bit
shorter<00:01:26.960> old<00:01:27.960> models<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:28.890> first<00:01:29.070> came

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
shorter old models when they first came

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
shorter old models when they first came
out<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.090> nineteen<00:01:31.020> ninety<00:01:31.380> six<00:01:31.710> or

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
out was like nineteen ninety six or

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.050 
out was like nineteen ninety six or
seven<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
seven I got that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.350 
seven I got that
and<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:34.740> been<00:01:34.920> extensively<00:01:35.520> modified<00:01:35.759> over

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and it's been extensively modified over

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.380 
and it's been extensively modified over
the<00:01:36.479> years<00:01:37.340> look<00:01:38.340> new<00:01:38.579> stuff<00:01:38.880> isn't<00:01:39.090> really

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the years look new stuff isn't really

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.179 
the years look new stuff isn't really
working

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
working

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
working
teams<00:01:41.189> associated<00:01:41.460> shocks<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
teams associated shocks on it that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.190 
teams associated shocks on it that
doesn't<00:01:43.140> even<00:01:43.380> match<00:01:43.649> off<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> t3<00:01:45.200> finally

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
doesn't even match off like a t3 finally

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
doesn't even match off like a t3 finally
make<00:01:46.380> those<00:01:46.590> shocks<00:01:46.920> anymore<00:01:47.430> everything<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
make those shocks anymore everything is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.740 
make those shocks anymore everything is
all<00:01:47.970> vintage<00:01:48.680> but<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:50.220> gotta<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.299> semble

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
all vintage but we gotta go on semble

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.880 
all vintage but we gotta go on semble
this<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.170> even<00:01:52.320> give<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> grease

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
this I don't even give you grease

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.350 
this I don't even give you grease
anymore<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.670> used<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> give<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
anymore for this used to give the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
anymore for this used to give the
assembly<00:01:54.810> grease<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.159> any<00:01:56.430> I'm

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
assembly grease so I don't have any I'm

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.959 
assembly grease so I don't have any I'm
just<00:01:56.670> using<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.380> break<00:01:58.380> grease<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> car<00:01:59.939> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
just using a break grease or a car I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.510 
just using a break grease or a car I
think<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.570> should<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.780> sufficient<00:02:01.520> because

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
think that should be sufficient because

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
think that should be sufficient because
it's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> pretty<00:02:03.509> extreme<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> brake<00:02:04.409> system

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it's a pretty extreme and a brake system

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.550 
it's a pretty extreme and a brake system
the<00:02:04.950> heat<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.310> everything<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.380> these<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the heat and everything and these to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
the heat and everything and these to
give<00:02:07.680> us<00:02:07.799> lost<00:02:08.009> tied<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.789> you've<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
give us lost tied to so you've got to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
give us lost tied to so you've got to
use<00:02:09.209> my<00:02:09.420> left<00:02:09.599> eye<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.080> kind<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> sucks

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
use my left eye so that kind of sucks

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.430 
use my left eye so that kind of sucks
what<00:02:11.700> I'll<00:02:12.000> show<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.900> assembly<00:02:12.960> process

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
what I'll show you the assembly process

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.559 
what I'll show you the assembly process
perhaps<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.520> how<00:02:15.030> they<00:02:15.150> look<00:02:15.300> when<00:02:15.480> they're

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
perhaps and how they look when they're

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.940 
perhaps and how they look when they're
they<00:02:18.569> don't<00:02:18.600> supply<00:02:19.080> some<00:02:19.319> directions<00:02:19.800> either

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
they don't supply some directions either

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.490 
they don't supply some directions either
but<00:02:20.400> I'll<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.060> because<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.360> built<00:02:21.660> many

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
but I'll know this because I built many

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.840 
but I'll know this because I built many
of<00:02:22.709> these<00:02:22.800> things<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.340> these<00:02:23.400> long<00:02:23.610> hasn't

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
of these things and these long hasn't

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.920 
of these things and these long hasn't
changed<00:02:24.209> over<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> years

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
changed over the years

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.570 
changed over the years
trailer<00:02:25.770> axle<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:28.340> bushing<00:02:29.340> piece

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
trailer axle this little bushing piece

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.030 
trailer axle this little bushing piece
goes<00:02:30.000> inside<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.570> axle<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.800> grease

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
goes inside that axle you have to grease

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.600 
goes inside that axle you have to grease
it<00:02:32.070> first<00:02:32.490> grease<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.770> goes<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.190> here

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
it first grease it that goes in here

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.600 
it first grease it that goes in here
I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:36.090> grease<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.540> yeah<00:02:36.980> then<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.430> little

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
I think grease it yeah then this little

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270 
I think grease it yeah then this little
pin<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.510> through<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.950> goes<00:02:41.100> through

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
pin go through that and it goes through

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.580 
pin go through that and it goes through
the<00:02:41.400> axle<00:02:41.819> I'll<00:02:42.630> show<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.020> try<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> show<00:02:43.530> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the axle I'll show it try to show you

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
the axle I'll show it try to show you
the<00:02:43.709> process<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.459> goes<00:02:44.730> assembly<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the process as it goes assembly is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.810 
the process as it goes assembly is
pretty<00:02:45.660> straightforward<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.040> I'm<00:02:47.640> as

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
pretty straightforward but I'm as

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.580 
pretty straightforward but I'm as
currents<00:02:48.209> these<00:02:48.300> are<00:02:48.450> gonna<00:02:48.540> work<00:02:48.840> hopefully

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
currents these are gonna work hopefully

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.910 
currents these are gonna work hopefully
the<00:02:50.480> using<00:02:51.480> our<00:02:51.630> brake<00:02:51.870> grease<00:02:52.200> down<00:02:52.500> there<00:02:52.769> or

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the using our brake grease down there or

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.560 
the using our brake grease down there or
just<00:02:53.070> put<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.459> tiny<00:02:53.700> bit<00:02:53.850> if<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.360> made<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
just put a little tiny bit if we made a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.210 
just put a little tiny bit if we made a
mess<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.840> our<00:02:55.050> axles<00:02:55.530> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.860> wipe<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
mess of our axles going to wipe that

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.400 
mess of our axles going to wipe that
down<00:02:56.489> you're<00:02:57.390> gonna<00:02:57.510> mess<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.140> cheap

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
down you're gonna mess with this cheap

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.060 
down you're gonna mess with this cheap
Chinese<00:02:58.860> desk<00:02:59.190> but<00:02:59.550> no<00:02:59.790> big<00:02:59.970> deal<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.040> now<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
Chinese desk but no big deal and now I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.580 
Chinese desk but no big deal and now I
have<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.610> put<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.820> little<00:03:03.000> lock<00:03:03.180> tight<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.900> so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
have to put a little lock tight on it so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.850 
have to put a little lock tight on it so
I<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:05.030> thread<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.300> little<00:03:06.600> set<00:03:06.780> screw<00:03:06.860> so

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
I can thread it in a little set screw so

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.259 
I can thread it in a little set screw so
you<00:03:07.950> know<00:03:08.070> what<00:03:08.250> these<00:03:08.400> things<00:03:08.580> were<00:03:08.730> about<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
you know what these things were about to

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.240 
you know what these things were about to
might<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> little<00:03:09.959> locks<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.650> guess<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.130> go

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
might be a little locks I guess that go

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.580 
might be a little locks I guess that go
around<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.580> outside<00:03:11.900> got<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.050> pin<00:03:13.260> used<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
around the outside got the pin used to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.710 
around the outside got the pin used to
back<00:03:13.769> guys<00:03:14.040> use<00:03:14.489> heat<00:03:14.730> shrink<00:03:15.030> I've<00:03:15.209> seen<00:03:15.450> here

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
back guys use heat shrink I've seen here

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.970 
back guys use heat shrink I've seen here
to<00:03:16.590> help<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.280> pin<00:03:17.459> stay<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.980> well

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
to help the the pin stay on but well

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.610 
to help the the pin stay on but well
frigerators<00:03:20.579> we're<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.410> one<00:03:22.410> is

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
frigerators we're going it one is

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.229 
frigerators we're going it one is
assembled<00:03:25.280> yeah<00:03:26.280> definitely<00:03:26.820> short<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.209> that

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
assembled yeah definitely short on that

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.300 
assembled yeah definitely short on that
one<00:03:28.100> damn<00:03:30.350> these<00:03:31.350> little<00:03:31.590> white<00:03:31.739> things<00:03:31.769> they

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
one damn these little white things they

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.069 
one damn these little white things they
just<00:03:32.519> slide<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.940> over<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.299> axle<00:03:33.690> they<00:03:33.900> got<00:03:34.049> a

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
just slide on over the axle they got a

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
just slide on over the axle they got a
little<00:03:34.350> groove<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.070> they<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.340> pop<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.790> like

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
little groove and they just pop on like

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.699 
little groove and they just pop on like
that<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.110> guess<00:03:37.320> they're<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.650> little

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that so I guess they're this little

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.340 
that so I guess they're this little
safety<00:03:38.250> thing<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.790> keep<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.209> uh<00:03:39.269> those<00:03:40.049> pins

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
safety thing to keep that uh those pins

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.710 
safety thing to keep that uh those pins
in<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.280> grub<00:03:41.519> screw<00:03:41.549> loosens<00:03:42.150> up<00:03:42.299> right

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
in that the grub screw loosens up right

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.300 
in that the grub screw loosens up right
there<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.040> that's<00:03:44.250> interesting

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
there so that's interesting

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.699 
there so that's interesting
installed<00:03:47.390> sort<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.570> as<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.590> say<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:51.230> got<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
installed sort of as you say I got the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.920 
installed sort of as you say I got the
shorter<00:03:53.070> axles<00:03:53.549> yes<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.180> more<00:03:54.390> suspension

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
shorter axles yes I have more suspension

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.600 
shorter axles yes I have more suspension

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.470 
travel
when<00:03:57.739> spent<00:03:58.739> your<00:03:58.860> arms<00:03:59.130> all<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.370> way<00:03:59.519> out<00:03:59.790> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
when spent your arms all the way out it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.699 
when spent your arms all the way out it
spin<00:04:00.810> over<00:04:00.989> here<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:02.340> almost<00:04:02.519> falls<00:04:02.970> out

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
spin over here it almost falls out

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.090 
spin over here it almost falls out
great<00:04:04.709> there

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
great there

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.810 
great there
but<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:06.910> doesn't<00:04:07.770> this<00:04:08.770> one<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.340> moved<00:04:09.640> that

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
but it doesn't this one I moved that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.610 
but it doesn't this one I moved that
little<00:04:10.060> drive<00:04:10.300> cup<00:04:10.630> out<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:11.020> little<00:04:11.170> bit<00:04:11.440> if<00:04:11.560> you

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620
