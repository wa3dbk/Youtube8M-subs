00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.970
 best of us we knew we know is 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.320

 also be with barovero that is one of 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.220
 the best Argentine archers here 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 with july with pleasure as is sharing 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.580
 the campus with them and contact also 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.620
 your coach if the truth that one 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.750
 learn every day with marcelo 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.090
 like july with pleasure when I was here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 one can enjoy every workout 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.380
 because every day he realizes every 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.150
 thing 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.920
 put the marcelo the other day when the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.930
 ball he takes out he says he sees when 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.120
 they go and the bounce then the then 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.770
 they are things that one does not think and water that 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.020
 when he shares with him he realizes 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.990
 of the magnitude of what Marcelo is 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.480
 July so much and good time now is not 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.430
 here but nothing always trying to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.070
 learn from them because you also 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.560
 It helps a lot to train you as an archer and 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.240
 nothing happy for also how is the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.950
 Chinese with the last good call 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.450
 for francs as was the first 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.950
 training today that you felt in the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.990
 moment that I went to the locker room 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.550
 you found the guys you are the most 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.800
 small here of the team 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.319
 to the first when before entering the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.900
 be I was already nervous 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.389
 and when I entered it was like I did not know 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.579
 nobody ever saw anything and when I saw a 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.189
 alcohol to the hotel was and how I relaxed 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.800
 for where I have to change and where 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.360
 I have to sit down and I calmed down 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.740
 I imagine that you already have enough 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.700
 more experience with the campus they will 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.680
 give a hand they will help 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.060
 the juveniles so we always go 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.310
 for high 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.190
 if we have almost the soul has a couple of 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.410
 years less but well we also form 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.540
 part of what would be the young people 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.069
 and the teenagers like that let's help him 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.530
 to him as much as they helped us 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.180
 we kept out the truth is guys 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.130
 thank you very much back congratulations 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.269
 and the best then hopefully they bring 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.440

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.440
