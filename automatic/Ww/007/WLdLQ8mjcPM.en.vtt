are about 55 in 3/4 inches long and the
fence<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.080> can<00:00:52.200> see<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.710> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
fence as you can see on this one is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.880 
fence as you can see on this one is
quite<00:00:53.130> a<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.340> longer<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.330> actually

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
quite a bit longer here this is actually

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
quite a bit longer here this is actually
about<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.950> 52<00:00:56.460> inch<00:00:56.489> fence<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.180> machine

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
about a 52 inch fence on this machine

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.120 
about a 52 inch fence on this machine
and<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.809> about<00:00:58.020> 6<00:00:58.320> inches<00:00:58.620> tall

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
and it's about 6 inches tall

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.370 
and it's about 6 inches tall
the<00:00:59.910> guard<00:01:00.150> on<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.390> works<00:01:00.630> very<00:01:00.840> much<00:01:00.930> like

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
the guard on this works very much like

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.660 
the guard on this works very much like
the<00:01:01.680> other<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.220> course<00:01:02.400> it's<00:01:02.580> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the other one here of course it's a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
the other one here of course it's a
spring-loaded<00:01:03.150> guard<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.440> will<00:01:04.619> fold

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
spring-loaded guard and this will fold

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
spring-loaded guard and this will fold
away<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> other<00:01:05.880> guard<00:01:06.119> does<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
away just like the other guard does the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.749 
away just like the other guard does the
fence<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.650> operates<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.610> bit

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
fence on this one operates a little bit

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.370 
fence on this one operates a little bit
different<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.630> center<00:01:09.990> mounted<00:01:10.259> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
different it's not a center mounted it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050 
different it's not a center mounted it's
a<00:01:10.470> end<00:01:10.710> mount<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> center<00:01:11.640> mount<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> let

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
a end mount and a center mount and let

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.219 
a end mount and a center mount and let
me<00:01:12.150> show<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.570> works<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.990> first

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
me show you how this works the first

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
me show you how this works the first
thing<00:01:16.350> I'll<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.160> slide<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> guard<00:01:17.850> over

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
thing I'll do is to slide the guard over

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
thing I'll do is to slide the guard over
a<00:01:18.180> little<00:01:18.330> bit<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> expose<00:01:18.960> some<00:01:19.140> cutter<00:01:19.350> head

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a little bit to expose some cutter head

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
a little bit to expose some cutter head
then<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> come<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.910> move

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
then I'm going to come back and I move

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.700 
then I'm going to come back and I move
the<00:01:21.240> fence<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> locking<00:01:22.380> knob

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the fence now there is a locking knob

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
the fence now there is a locking knob
right<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.970> allows<00:01:24.300> us<00:01:24.330> first<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> all

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
right here this allows us first of all

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.719 
right here this allows us first of all
you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.830> how<00:01:25.950> rigid<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.460> fence

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you can see just how rigid this fence

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.820 
you can see just how rigid this fence
system<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.840> move<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> entire<00:01:28.290> fence

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
system is you can move the entire fence

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.340 
system is you can move the entire fence
because<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.399> mounts<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.270> rail<00:01:30.539> as<00:01:31.289> well

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because it mounts on this rail as well

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
because it mounts on this rail as well
as<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> center<00:01:32.100> around<00:01:32.160> I'm<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.550> unlock

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
as the center around I'm going to unlock

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.230 
as the center around I'm going to unlock
the<00:01:33.569> center<00:01:33.929> mount<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.580> unlock<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:36.090> rail

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the center mount and to unlock the rail

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.180 
the center mount and to unlock the rail
it's<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> twist<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> knob<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.160> I

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
it's just a twist of the knob and now I

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.820 
it's just a twist of the knob and now I
can<00:01:38.399> slide<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.789> entire<00:01:39.060> fence<00:01:39.300> system<00:01:39.679> in<00:01:40.679> on

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
can slide the entire fence system in on

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.880 
can slide the entire fence system in on
the<00:01:40.920> machine<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.569> lock<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.170> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the machine and I can lock it down so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.260 
the machine and I can lock it down so
that<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.459> move<00:01:44.490> forward<00:01:44.819> back<00:01:45.060> now

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that it doesn't move forward back now

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.029 
that it doesn't move forward back now
this<00:01:45.450> handle<00:01:45.840> will<00:01:46.289> actually<00:01:46.679> allow<00:01:46.800> me<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
this handle will actually allow me to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.850 
this handle will actually allow me to
pivot<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> bevel<00:01:49.140> cut<00:01:49.319> and<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.679> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pivot and to do a bevel cut and as I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.070 
pivot and to do a bevel cut and as I
tilt<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.340> you'll<00:01:51.000> notice<00:01:51.179> that<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.509> pivots

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
tilt this you'll notice that this pivots

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.469 
tilt this you'll notice that this pivots
right<00:01:52.289> underneath<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> table<00:01:53.459> and<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
right underneath the table and that the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
right underneath the table and that the
edge<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.959> fence<00:01:55.170> stays<00:01:55.649> very<00:01:56.429> very<00:01:56.640> close

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
edge of the fence stays very very close

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.210 
edge of the fence stays very very close
to<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> table<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> lock<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:59.009> it'll

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
to the table when I lock this down it'll

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.840 
to the table when I lock this down it'll
actually<00:01:59.399> square<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> fence<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.670> lock

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
actually square the fence and I can lock

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.430 
actually square the fence and I can lock
the<00:02:02.910> center<00:02:03.360> portion<00:02:03.509> down<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.229> well

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
the center portion down here as well

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.440 
the center portion down here as well
this<00:02:05.429> gives<00:02:05.610> me<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.819> little<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.119> stability

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
this gives me a little more stability

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.790 
this gives me a little more stability
and<00:02:06.630> you'll<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.929> that<00:02:07.050> with<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.289> lock<00:02:07.530> down

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
and you'll see that with this lock down

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.219 
and you'll see that with this lock down
again<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.970> very<00:02:09.330> stiff<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:09.869> rigid

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
again it's very stiff and very rigid

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.530 
again it's very stiff and very rigid
even<00:02:11.069> when<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.370> tilted<00:02:11.730> now<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
even when it's tilted now there is a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.230 
even when it's tilted now there is a
positive<00:02:12.900> stop<00:02:13.319> at<00:02:13.500> 90<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.190> 45<00:02:14.520> degrees<00:02:15.030> as

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
same as the surfaces on the jointer bed

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.959 
same as the surfaces on the jointer bed
this<00:05:08.800> is<00:05:08.979> what<00:05:09.129> we<00:05:09.219> call<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.430> low<00:05:09.669> friction

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
this is what we call a low friction

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.399 
this is what we call a low friction
surface<00:05:10.629> and<00:05:10.779> you'll<00:05:10.870> notice<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.110> it's<00:05:11.319> not

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
surface and you'll notice that it's not

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.409 
surface and you'll notice that it's not
machines<00:05:11.830> shiny<00:05:12.159> like<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.520> other<00:05:12.639> ones<00:05:12.879> but

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
machines shiny like the other ones but

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.510 
machines shiny like the other ones but
it<00:05:13.479> has<00:05:13.659> these<00:05:13.840> very<00:05:14.169> very<00:05:14.500> slight<00:05:14.860> ridges<00:05:15.370> to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
it has these very very slight ridges to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.790 
it has these very very slight ridges to
the<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:16.029> the<00:05:16.120> surface<00:05:16.539> and<00:05:17.020> they<00:05:17.349> call<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:17.620> a

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
the to the surface and they call that a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.890 
the to the surface and they call that a
cold<00:05:18.340> planing<00:05:18.879> or<00:05:19.000> cold<00:05:19.240> scraping<00:05:19.719> on<00:05:19.810> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
cold planing or cold scraping on the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.350 
cold planing or cold scraping on the
table<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.620> that<00:05:20.889> allows<00:05:21.219> us<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.580> very<00:05:21.849> very<00:05:22.029> low

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
table and that allows us a very very low

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.390 
table and that allows us a very very low
friction<00:05:22.779> it<00:05:23.560> also<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.039> kind<00:05:24.189> of<00:05:24.310> a

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
friction it also is kind of a

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.999 
friction it also is kind of a
directional<00:05:24.759> feel<00:05:25.210> if<00:05:25.389> you<00:05:25.509> feel<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:26.050> in<00:05:26.740> one

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
directional feel if you feel that in one

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.320 
directional feel if you feel that in one
direction<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.460> have<00:05:27.639> a<00:05:27.669> little<00:05:27.819> bit<00:05:27.969> of<00:05:28.090> drag

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
direction you have a little bit of drag

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.269 
direction you have a little bit of drag
in<00:05:28.569> the<00:05:28.689> other<00:05:28.810> direction<00:05:29.080> you<00:05:29.439> actually<00:05:30.159> have

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:30.279 
in the other direction you actually have

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.339 
in the other direction you actually have
a<00:05:30.310> little<00:05:30.490> less<00:05:30.759> drag<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.449> it<00:05:31.839> allows<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.259> to

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
a little less drag and it allows you to

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.899 
a little less drag and it allows you to
feed<00:05:32.500> stock<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.039> machine<00:05:33.430> very<00:05:33.669> easily

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
feed stock to the machine very easily

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.939 
feed stock to the machine very easily
now<00:05:34.779> one<00:05:35.020> of<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.199> things<00:05:35.379> you<00:05:35.529> want<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.800> note

is<00:06:04.960> a<00:06:04.990> nice<00:06:05.500> feature<00:06:05.770> of<00:06:05.919> this<00:06:06.129> machine<00:06:06.370> you

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
is a nice feature of this machine you

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.999 
is a nice feature of this machine you
can<00:06:07.270> actually<00:06:07.419> rotate<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:08.169> direction<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:08.830> the

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
can actually rotate the direction of the

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.279 
can actually rotate the direction of the
cutter<00:06:09.219> head<00:06:09.460> when<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.300> go<00:06:10.449> to<00:06:10.509> mortise<00:06:10.930> you

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
cutter head when you go to mortise you

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.390 
cutter head when you go to mortise you
can<00:06:11.439> actually<00:06:11.680> turn<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:12.009> cutter<00:06:12.189> head

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
can actually turn the cutter head

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.980 
can actually turn the cutter head
backwards<00:06:12.909> so<00:06:13.029> it's<00:06:13.180> in<00:06:13.270> a<00:06:13.360> non<00:06:13.569> cutting

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
backwards so it's in a non cutting

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.110 
backwards so it's in a non cutting
direction<00:06:14.469> so<00:06:15.009> you<00:06:15.159> can<00:06:15.310> turn<00:06:15.490> a<00:06:15.550> mortise<00:06:16.000> in

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
direction so you can turn a mortise in

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.360 
direction so you can turn a mortise in
bit<00:06:16.330> in<00:06:16.569> that<00:06:16.629> direction<00:06:17.069> the<00:06:18.069> other<00:06:18.099> thing

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
bit in that direction the other thing

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.649 
bit in that direction the other thing
you<00:06:18.460> can<00:06:18.610> do<00:06:18.699> is<00:06:18.819> if<00:06:18.909> you<00:06:18.969> have<00:06:19.180> a<00:06:19.210> left-handed

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
you can do is if you have a left-handed

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:20.850 
you can do is if you have a left-handed
bit<00:06:19.810> or<00:06:19.990> a<00:06:20.020> right<00:06:20.229> hand<00:06:20.409> a<00:06:20.469> bit<00:06:20.589> you<00:06:20.680> can<00:06:20.740> use

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
bit or a right hand a bit you can use

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.469 
bit or a right hand a bit you can use
either<00:06:21.339> one<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.639> them<00:06:21.819> by<00:06:21.939> switching<00:06:22.389> the

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
either one of them by switching the

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.269 
either one of them by switching the
direction<00:06:22.509> of<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:22.990> head<00:06:23.169> now<00:06:23.919> there's<00:06:24.099> one

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
direction of the head now there's one

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.769 
direction of the head now there's one
more<00:06:24.310> switch<00:06:24.759> that's<00:06:25.000> on<00:06:25.089> the<00:06:25.180> opposite<00:06:25.539> side

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
more switch that's on the opposite side

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.540 
more switch that's on the opposite side
let's<00:06:25.990> have<00:06:26.050> a<00:06:26.139> look<00:06:26.319> we're<00:06:27.099> over<00:06:27.219> here<00:06:27.339> at<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
let's have a look we're over here at the

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.100 
let's have a look we're over here at the
infeed<00:06:27.909> side<00:06:28.150> of<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.389> planer<00:06:28.629> you<00:06:28.810> notice
