00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
intervention it can be very difficult

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.609 
intervention it can be very difficult
and<00:00:23.670> very<00:00:23.760> harmful<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.539> read<00:00:25.230> his<00:00:25.410> statement

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and very harmful I read his statement

and very harmful I read his statement
saying<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.550> he<00:00:27.150> saved<00:00:27.449> his<00:00:27.689> Korea<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
saying that he saved his Korea and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
saying that he saved his Korea and
probably<00:00:28.800> his<00:00:29.070> life<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.789> he<00:00:30.000> probably<00:00:30.210> did<00:00:30.720> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
probably his life and he probably did I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
probably his life and he probably did I
would<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> they'd<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.550> every<00:00:33.360> reason

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
would think that they'd be every reason

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.740 
would think that they'd be every reason
to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.960> optimistic<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.829> his<00:00:35.250> case<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:36.120> he

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
to be optimistic in his case because he

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.860 
to be optimistic in his case because he
recognized<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> problem<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:38.550> sought<00:00:38.820> help<00:00:39.090> he

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
recognized the problem he sought help he

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.389 
recognized the problem he sought help he
seems<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.350> responding<00:00:40.530> well<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
seems to be responding well to the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.000 
seems to be responding well to the
problem<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.170> he<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> support

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
problem as long as he has a support

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
problem as long as he has a support
system<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.789> he<00:00:44.969> cooperates<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.989> he

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
system and he cooperates with it he

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.660 
system and he cooperates with it he
should<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.559> well<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.149> thinking<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.780> we

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
should do very well and I thinking if we

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
should do very well and I thinking if we
excluded<00:00:50.670> everybody<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.480> borderline

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
excluded everybody with borderline

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
excluded everybody with borderline
personality<00:00:52.020> disorder<00:00:52.800> we'd<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
personality disorder we'd have a lot of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
personality disorder we'd have a lot of
people<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> work<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.320> addition<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.949> what

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
people out of work in addition to what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.459 
people out of work in addition to what
we<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.430> already<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.050> they

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
we have already I think if they

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
we have already I think if they
recognize<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.219> problem<00:00:59.430> they<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> help

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
recognize the problem they get the help

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.930 
recognize the problem they get the help
they<00:01:00.629> need<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> support<00:01:01.739> system

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
they need and have a support system

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
they need and have a support system
there's<00:01:02.940> no<00:01:03.059> reason<00:01:03.420> why<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.719> can't

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
there's no reason why they can't

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
there's no reason why they can't

involved<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.599> disorder<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.140> people<00:02:22.409> with

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
involved in this disorder so people with

involved in this disorder so people with
this<00:02:22.650> disorder<00:02:22.860> typically<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.549> think<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
this disorder typically you think of

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.390 
this disorder typically you think of
females<00:02:24.180> having<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.840> about<00:02:24.930> 75%<00:02:25.590> females

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
females having it it's about 75% females

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.580 
females having it it's about 75% females
but<00:02:26.580> there's<00:02:26.790> also<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.750> idea<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.110> males<00:02:28.409> are

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
but there's also the idea that males are

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.210 
but there's also the idea that males are
under<00:02:28.769> diagnosed<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:30.239> there's<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> lot<00:02:30.690> of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
under diagnosed but there's a lot of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.610 
under diagnosed but there's a lot of
self-mutilation<00:02:32.220> attempts<00:02:33.150> at<00:02:33.299> suicide<00:02:33.620> a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
self-mutilation attempts at suicide a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.640 
self-mutilation attempts at suicide a
lot<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.670> happens<00:02:36.060> oftentimes<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.780> kids

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
lot of what happens oftentimes as kids

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.170 
lot of what happens oftentimes as kids
the<00:02:37.860> relationship<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.700> parent<00:02:39.060> might

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the relationship with the parent might

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.490 
the relationship with the parent might
not<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.450> strong<00:02:39.629> they<00:02:39.870> might<00:02:39.989> have<00:02:40.079> bond<00:02:40.290> well

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
not be strong they might have bond well

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
not be strong they might have bond well
and<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:41.430> develop<00:02:41.760> what's<00:02:41.910> called

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and so they develop what's called

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.660 
and so they develop what's called
splitting<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.720> deep<00:02:43.230> intense<00:02:44.010> feelings<00:02:44.579> of

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
splitting so deep intense feelings of

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.940 
splitting so deep intense feelings of
anger<00:02:44.909> can<00:02:45.180> come<00:02:45.329> out<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.629> nowhere<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.170> then

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
anger can come out of nowhere and then

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.589 
anger can come out of nowhere and then
that<00:02:47.069> can<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.280> followed<00:02:47.459> by<00:02:47.730> extreme

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
that can be followed by extreme

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.920 
that can be followed by extreme
idealization<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:49.920> really<00:02:50.160> unstable

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
idealization so it's really unstable

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.559 
idealization so it's really unstable
relationships<00:02:52.069> self-image<00:02:53.150> emotions<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
relationships self-image emotions and a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.089 
relationships self-image emotions and a
lot<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> impulsivity<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.799> might<00:02:55.920> go

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
lot of impulsivity like they might go

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.069 
lot of impulsivity like they might go
out<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.340> gamble<00:02:56.700> or<00:02:56.879> they<00:02:57.480> might<00:02:57.599> engage<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:58.019> a
