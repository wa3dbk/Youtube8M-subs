00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
well right now in here I'm growing a lot

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.460 
well right now in here I'm growing a lot
of<00:00:02.879> basil<00:00:03.000> we<00:00:03.419> generally<00:00:04.110> grow<00:00:04.259> three

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
of basil we generally grow three

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.019 
of basil we generally grow three
different<00:00:04.740> kinds<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.100> go<00:00:05.310> grow<00:00:05.549> sweet<00:00:05.879> the

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
different kinds you go grow sweet the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.690 
different kinds you go grow sweet the
Genovese<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.660> dwarf<00:00:06.899> you're<00:00:07.710> doing<00:00:07.980> every

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
Genovese of a dwarf you're doing every

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.759 
Genovese of a dwarf you're doing every
now<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:08.940> then<00:00:09.000> we'll<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.269> lemon<00:00:09.780> or<00:00:10.230> cinnamon

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
now and then we'll do lemon or cinnamon

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.530 
now and then we'll do lemon or cinnamon
or<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.099> kind<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.550> specialty<00:00:11.940> basil<00:00:12.389> that

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
or some kind of specialty basil that

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.690 
or some kind of specialty basil that
someone<00:00:12.809> would<00:00:12.900> get<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> kick<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.519> but<00:00:14.519> for

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
someone would get a kick out of but for

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.970 
someone would get a kick out of but for
the<00:00:14.790> most<00:00:14.940> part<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.560> things<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.920> we

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the most part we do the things that we

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.910 
the most part we do the things that we
find<00:00:17.160> sell<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> best<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.380> that's<00:00:19.619> kind<00:00:19.890> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
find sell the best and that's kind of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
find sell the best and that's kind of
part<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> economics<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.480> looking

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
part of the economics that we're looking

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
part of the economics that we're looking
at<00:00:22.039> figuring<00:00:23.039> out<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> market<00:00:24.029> actually

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
at figuring out what the market actually

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.140 
at figuring out what the market actually
wants<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.380> interesting<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.580> interesting

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
wants is interesting really interesting

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
wants is interesting really interesting
so<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:29.670> grow<00:00:30.199> also<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.560> grow<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> lot<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.009> grapes

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so we grow also we grow a lot of grapes

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.790 
so we grow also we grow a lot of grapes
you<00:00:32.399> grow<00:00:32.550> mustard<00:00:32.940> greens<00:00:34.670> bok<00:00:35.670> choy

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.850 

here<00:00:40.940> go<00:00:41.660> some<00:00:41.899> leaf<00:00:42.050> lettuces<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:42.559> some

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
here go some leaf lettuces and some

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.190 
here go some leaf lettuces and some
romaine<00:00:43.219> one<00:00:44.210> thing<00:00:44.390> we<00:00:44.510> discovered<00:00:44.930> we<00:00:44.989> put<00:00:45.170> a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
romaine one thing we discovered we put a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.510 
romaine one thing we discovered we put a
lot<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.440> leaf<00:00:45.590> lettuce<00:00:45.829> out<00:00:46.040> at<00:00:46.190> first<00:00:46.370> because

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
lot of leaf lettuce out at first because

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.760 
lot of leaf lettuce out at first because
we<00:00:46.610> figured<00:00:46.940> that's<00:00:47.059> what<00:00:47.270> people<00:00:47.390> like

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
we figured that's what people like

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.020 
we figured that's what people like
people<00:00:48.770> didn't<00:00:48.980> like<00:00:49.100> if<00:00:49.280> they<00:00:49.489> want<00:00:49.670> to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
people didn't like if they want to

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.240 
people didn't like if they want to
they<00:00:50.690> want<00:00:50.930> head<00:00:51.140> looks<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.649> don't<00:00:51.680> understand

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
they want head looks I don't understand

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.220 
they want head looks I don't understand
it<00:00:52.399> but<00:00:52.730> I'm<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.850> gardener<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:54.379> know

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it but I'm a gardener so you know

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
it but I'm a gardener so you know
the<00:00:55.530> reality<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.040> that<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.730> market<00:00:57.060> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the reality is that the market is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
the reality is that the market is
conditioned<00:00:57.570> people<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.020> want<00:00:58.260> certain

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
conditioned people to want certain

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
conditioned people to want certain
things<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:59.210> people<00:01:00.210> tend<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> prefer<00:01:00.930> romaine

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
things and people tend to prefer romaine

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.090 
things and people tend to prefer romaine
it<00:01:01.590> seems<00:01:01.800> simpler<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
it seems simpler for them so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.160 
it seems simpler for them so
now<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.879> know<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.330> takes<00:01:05.510> about<00:01:05.600> eight<00:01:05.930> weeks

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
now you know it takes about eight weeks

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.350 
now you know it takes about eight weeks
when<00:01:06.830> we<00:01:06.979> learn<00:01:07.520> something<00:01:07.820> it<00:01:08.030> takes<00:01:08.210> about

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
when we learn something it takes about

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.480 
when we learn something it takes about
two<00:01:08.750> months<00:01:09.110> for<00:01:09.290> us<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:09.740> from<00:01:10.040> learning

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
two months for us to get from learning

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.690 
two months for us to get from learning
it's<00:01:10.640> actually<00:01:11.060> implementing

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's actually implementing

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.890 

fix<00:01:14.330> so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
fix so

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.690 
fix so
we've<00:01:17.320> got<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> lot<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.710> romaine<00:01:18.070> now<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:18.550> that

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
we've got a lot of romaine now but that

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.820 
we've got a lot of romaine now but that
took<00:01:18.910> us<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.210> first<00:01:19.390> month<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.900> production<00:01:20.080> to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
took us the first month of production to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.610 
took us the first month of production to
figure<00:01:21.130> out<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.540> everything<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:22.990> too<00:01:23.110> late<00:01:23.290> and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
figure out so everything is too late and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.290 
figure out so everything is too late and
we're<00:01:24.040> starting<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.580> get<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.850> point<00:01:25.150> where

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
we're starting to get to the point where

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.590 
we're starting to get to the point where
we<00:01:25.420> actually<00:01:25.570> have<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.500> right<00:01:26.980> stuff<00:01:27.730> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
we actually have the right stuff the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.720 
we actually have the right stuff the
things<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.990> are<00:01:29.080> selling<00:01:29.500> well<00:01:29.950> or<00:01:30.700> that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
things that are selling well or that

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.960 
things that are selling well or that
consumers<00:01:31.420> are<00:01:31.630> looking<00:01:31.660> for<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:33.790> do<00:01:33.940> a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
consumers are looking for and we do a

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.090 
consumers are looking for and we do a
lot<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.210> consumer<00:01:34.660> feedback<00:01:34.840> stuff<00:01:35.260> as<00:01:35.410> well

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
lot of consumer feedback stuff as well

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.740 
lot of consumer feedback stuff as well
as<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.400> goes<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.820> try<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.240> figure<00:01:37.360> out<00:01:37.480> what

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
as that goes to try and figure out what

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.680 
as that goes to try and figure out what
the<00:01:37.870> market<00:01:38.230> actually<00:01:38.320> wants<00:01:38.770> but<00:01:39.640> we<00:01:40.600> do

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
the market actually wants but we do

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.350 
the market actually wants but we do
basil<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.460> tower<00:01:42.460> has<00:01:42.670> been<00:01:42.880> part<00:01:43.150> was

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
basil that tower has been part was

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.690 
basil that tower has been part was
harvested

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
harvested

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.280 
harvested
we<00:01:45.820> just<00:01:46.000> took<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.240> out<00:01:46.299> yesterday<00:01:46.810> out<00:01:46.960> of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
we just took it out yesterday out of

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.760 
we just took it out yesterday out of
play<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:48.520> they<00:01:48.640> cut<00:01:49.630> back<00:01:49.810> pretty<00:01:50.050> well<00:01:50.140> and

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
play so they cut back pretty well and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.700 
play so they cut back pretty well and
we'll<00:01:51.580> get<00:01:51.730> another<00:01:52.060> flush<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.810> growth<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:53.560> do

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
we'll get another flush of growth we do

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.370 
we'll get another flush of growth we do
one<00:01:54.130> cutting<00:01:54.400> on<00:01:54.640> our<00:01:54.970> basil<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:56.200> we

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
one cutting on our basil and then we

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.410 
one cutting on our basil and then we
throw<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.710> out<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.550> we<00:01:57.820> start<00:01:58.060> from<00:01:58.210> scratch

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
throw it out and we start from scratch

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.780 
throw it out and we start from scratch
just<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:59.140> kind<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.380> take<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.770> keep<00:01:59.980> it<00:02:00.160> tasted

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
just to kind of take the keep it tasted

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.840 
just to kind of take the keep it tasted
really<00:02:00.820> good<00:02:01.060> shame<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.050> flavor<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.700> gets

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
really good shame on the flavor it gets

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.910 
really good shame on the flavor it gets
more<00:02:04.030> bitter<00:02:04.270> people<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.840> blankets<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.830> we

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
more bitter people in blankets so we

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160 
more bitter people in blankets so we
found<00:02:06.130> we<00:02:06.250> can<00:02:06.370> do<00:02:06.490> one<00:02:06.670> cutting<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.870> no

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
found we can do one cutting and with no

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.469 
found we can do one cutting and with no
impacts<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.740> flavors<00:02:09.070> really<00:02:09.420> before<00:02:10.420> we

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
impacts and flavors really before we

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.250 
impacts and flavors really before we
have<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.780> go<00:02:10.869> back

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
have to go back

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.250 
have to go back
that's<00:02:11.500> Timothy's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that's Timothy's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.559 
that's Timothy's
that's<00:02:14.010> Genovese<00:02:14.459> Basin<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.030> that'll<00:02:15.300> be<00:02:15.420> in

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that's Genovese Basin so that'll be in

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.600 
that's Genovese Basin so that'll be in
up<00:02:15.690> another<00:02:15.959> two<00:02:16.170> weeks<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:17.099> it'll<00:02:17.430> go<00:02:17.550> to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
up another two weeks and it'll go to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.680 
up another two weeks and it'll go to
market<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.830> those<00:02:20.040> towers<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.060> get

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
market and on those towers we can get

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.550 
market and on those towers we can get
anywhere<00:02:22.110> from<00:02:22.400> $40<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.430> well<00:02:23.819> over<00:02:24.060> $100<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
anywhere from $40 to well over $100 and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.759 
anywhere from $40 to well over $100 and
profit<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.610> gross<00:02:27.060> profit<00:02:28.010> gross<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> by<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
profit and gross profit gross so by a

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.650 
profit and gross profit gross so by a
three-chip<00:02:32.190> just<00:02:32.730> picking<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.480> there

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
three-chip just picking it back in there

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.300 
three-chip just picking it back in there
and<00:02:33.780> letting<00:02:33.900> every<00:02:34.200> grow<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:35.040> able<00:02:35.130> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and letting every grow we're able to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.890 
and letting every grow we're able to
chop<00:02:35.550> about<00:02:35.730> two<00:02:36.090> weeks<00:02:36.300> off<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.690> production

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
chop about two weeks off the production

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.949 
chop about two weeks off the production
cycle<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:38.730> nice<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.120> helps<00:02:39.390> us<00:02:39.510> cycle

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
cycle so that's nice you helps us cycle

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.080 
cycle so that's nice you helps us cycle
that's<00:02:40.920> part<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.280> logistic<00:02:41.730> model<00:02:42.000> that

that's part of the logistic model that
we're<00:02:42.209> looking<00:02:42.299> at<00:02:42.569> it's<00:02:42.720> try<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.930> figure<00:02:43.110> out

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
we're looking at it's try to figure out

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.820 
we're looking at it's try to figure out
how<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.099> most<00:02:44.340> efficiently<00:02:44.819> how<00:02:45.599> we

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
how we do this most efficiently how we

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.990 
how we do this most efficiently how we
generate<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> most<00:02:47.040> income<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.459> short<00:02:47.760> amount

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
generate the most income a short amount

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.150 
generate the most income a short amount
of<00:02:48.090> time
