00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.870
 welcome again orlan robert today 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.700
 We wanted to show you a series of 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 special products with which maybe 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.390
 many users are not familiar 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.010
 since they are more closely linked with 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.869
 racing cars or vehicles 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 prepared as we demonstrate in other 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.199
 notes with the quit man the products on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.599
 land rober are at the height of 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.000
 best international brands but with 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.650
 several advantages one that today are 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.149
 much easier to get 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.219
 second its price is much more 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 accessible and third have the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.670
 guarantee and the support of a company 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.230
 that an option is found in the country 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 that many users do not know is that of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.390
 glycerin bath orlando offers it in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.039
 the competition line and can be applied 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.949
 to thermometers and manometers 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.020
 mechanical the bathroom in design presents 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.660
 several advantages one is to cushion 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.239
 own the vehicle vibrations 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.039
 that allows a better reading and avoids a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
 premature wear of the components 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.340
 of the instrument by friction and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.500
 friction 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.420
 The other advantage of bathing in glycerin is 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.299
 which stabilizes to say it of some 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.880
 forms the sudden changes in pressure of the 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.590
 fluid that is being censed for example 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.840
 in fuel gauges or from 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.880
 turbo is very useful to eliminate these 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.060
 vibrations and thus optimize the use of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 instrument 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.009
 another instrument that you can find in 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.780
 orlando see and they will not find 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.140
 no other national trademark or in 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.850
 Chinese is the nitrous oxide manometer 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.590
 this gas is used to increase the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.920
 amount of oxygen available in the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.960
 combustion and thus increase the power the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.549
 nitrogen released also works as 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.920
 a thermal buffer inside the 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.229
 chamber of excess energy 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.090
 energy that occurs must remember 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.729
 that as there is an increase of the component 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.770
 a greater injection of 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.049
 fuel so that the mixture between 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.049
 fuel and component is optimal 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.490
 and if we are talking about a mixture 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.619
 optimal let's move on to the next instrument 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.350
 which is just the indicator of mixing 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.910
 combustible air is an instrument to which 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.920
 we call him I mix meters but 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.350
 which is usually known as ratio or as 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.600
 the fib indicating he is mixing 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.640
 air and fuel that is generated during 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.590
 the combustion process so it's 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.330
 an indispensable instrument for 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.600
 achieve a correct set-up of the 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.370
 engine if what you sense is more oxygen 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.800
 what fuel is said to be a 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.620
 poor mix otherwise 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.810
 there is more fuel than air what is 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.910
 he says it's a rich mix for the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.640
 indication this instrument uses a 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.530
 series of colored LEDs the quadrant is 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.690
 is permanently illuminated by 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.420
 a high intensity blue LED what 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.150
 It allows a long lifespan and a low 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.290
 level of electrical consumption and allows 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.360
 also a very good visualization 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.040
 overnight 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.600
 to make the measurement in this 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.540
 instrument uses an oxygen sensor 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.220
 also known as lambda probe this 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.440
 sensor what it performs is constantly 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.600
 a comparison between the oxygen inside 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 of the exhaust manifold and out of it and 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.680
 generates a potential difference that 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.140
 is what the instrument reads and shows 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.740
 on the screen to have a correct 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.840
 signal 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.820
 the sensor must reach the temperature 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.860
 of work of approximately 300 degrees 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.570
 that's why there are two types of 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.790
 sensors those who possess a 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.100
 heating resistance to which has three 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.470
 or four cables and those that do not have it 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.090
 that have one or two wires the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.010
 difference between the two is that one 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.390
 reaches temperature more quickly 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.390
 of work that the other 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.319
 we just showed you an instrument that 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.270
 measure what happens in the multiple of 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.920
 escape now let's show him another one that 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.069
 measure what happens in the multiple of 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.660
 admission this is the vacuous meter 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.630
 just the baco metro what he does is 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.640
 think about the depression that occurs in 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.020
 the intake manifold when the 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.330
 cylinders absorb the mixture 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.310
 its application is very useful because it detects 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.380
 faults in the engine and also has the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.810
 great virtue of indicating us the regime 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.970
 optimal acceleration for the maximum 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.319
 Engine performance with a minimum 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.790
 fuel consumption 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.469
 as I just commented that this 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.389
 instrument is used to measure faults in 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.430
 the engines exist what they call baco 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.639
 workshop meters with a larger diameter 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.020
 that facilitates its reading in the part of 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.270
 technical support on our website 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.669
 they will be able to find a table in the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.020
 that we give them approximate values for 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.180
 detect possible engine faults 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.190
 another very useful product for those who 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.990
 are in the competition or for those who 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.940
 they demand a lot from their engine, that is, 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.220
 work issues or issues 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.349
 of fun is the motor watchman 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.870
 also known as motor pairs or 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.849
 protector this instrument for example 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.430
 was installed in the entire fleet of the 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.740
 fiat line that ran in 2011 in 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.539
 the racetrack before the intention and today 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.190
 in day is being installed in all the 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.870
 fleet of sonics that are going to run 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.150
 during this year in Uruguay 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.640
 it is an instrument what it does is to alert 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.640
 us through a sound alarm and a light 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.980
 before the low oil pressure the high 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.840
 temperature or low battery charge and 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.669
 eventually if the problem is not 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.810
 corrected for the motor to avoid 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.810
 major damage 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.280
 finally a very interesting product and 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.680
 little known is the speedometer of 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.390
 7 - segment digital display of this 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.010
 instrument is ideal for those who 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.050
 they are setting up a vehicle or they want 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.870
 count with maximum precision in 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.910
 This speed and kilometers traveled 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.490
 it's because you can adapt to the 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.310
 tread vehicle regardless of 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.600
 transmission ratio or the wheeled 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.490
 This instrument also has a 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.770
 micro keyboard with which it is possible 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.480
 reset a partial odometer or 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.480
 visualize the total odometer 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.290
 We also have many other products 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.210
 like turbo pressure gauges 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.210
 fuel that we invite you to know 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.560
