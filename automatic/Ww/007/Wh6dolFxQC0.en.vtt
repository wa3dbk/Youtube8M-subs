HVLP models and the choice here because

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.679 
HVLP models and the choice here because
it's<00:00:22.590> such<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> limited<00:00:23.310> amount<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.240> material

it's such a limited amount of material
that<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.900> need<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.140> spray<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.590> literally

going to spray about two quarts the

going to spray about two quarts the
choice<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.949> pretty<00:00:29.250> quickly<00:00:29.550> narrowed<00:00:29.970> down

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
choice is pretty quickly narrowed down

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.709 
choice is pretty quickly narrowed down

next to it as a pro shot fine finish and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
next to it as a pro shot fine finish and
these<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.219> both<00:00:44.309> 18<00:00:44.760> volt<00:00:45.030> cordless<00:00:45.390> models

these are both 18 volt cordless models
the<00:00:46.800> fine<00:00:47.340> finish<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.090> bit<00:00:48.210> smaller

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the fine finish is a little bit smaller

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.290 
the fine finish is a little bit smaller
if<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.379> had<00:00:49.559> boxes<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.910> needed<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
if we had boxes in here and needed to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.760 
if we had boxes in here and needed to
spray<00:00:51.539> inside<00:00:51.980> drawer<00:00:52.980> boxes<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.760> carcasses<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
spray inside drawer boxes or carcasses I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.020 
spray inside drawer boxes or carcasses I
might<00:00:55.770> choose<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
might choose that one because it's a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
might choose that one because it's a
little<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.570> smaller<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.379> more

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little a little smaller a little more

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.569 
little a little smaller a little more
slimline<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.609> navigating<00:01:00.090> inside<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:01.020> stuff

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
slimline for navigating inside of stuff

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
slimline for navigating inside of stuff
but<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> mostly<00:01:04.019> open<00:01:04.199> road

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but because this is mostly open road

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
but because this is mostly open road
parts<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.549> pieces<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.900> wide<00:01:07.049> open<00:01:07.439> I'm

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
parts and pieces in the wide open I'm

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.000 
parts and pieces in the wide open I'm
going<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> bigger<00:01:08.220> Pro<00:01:08.939> shot<00:01:09.210> model<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
going with the bigger Pro shot model and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.109 
going with the bigger Pro shot model and
one<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> reasons<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> because

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
one of the reasons for that is because

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.840 
one of the reasons for that is because
we're<00:01:12.450> spraying<00:01:12.659> acrylic<00:01:13.170> primer<00:01:13.850> without

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we're spraying acrylic primer without

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.960 
we're spraying acrylic primer without
thinning<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.130> that's<00:01:17.130> difficult<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.820> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
thinning and that's difficult to do with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.280 
thinning and that's difficult to do with
HVLP<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.430> in<00:01:20.430> such<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> small<00:01:21.090> quantity<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
HVLP and in such a small quantity it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
HVLP and in such a small quantity it
doesn't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.979> sense<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> set<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
doesn't really make sense to set up a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.679 
doesn't really make sense to set up a
big<00:01:24.000> machine<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.890> pro<00:01:26.340> shot

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
big machine to do it with the pro shot

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
big machine to do it with the pro shot
runs<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.900> 2,000<00:01:28.470> psi<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> has<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.390> problem

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
runs at 2,000 psi so it has no problem

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.420 
runs at 2,000 psi so it has no problem
moving<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.079> product<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.189> fine

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
moving a product like that the fine

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.109 
moving a product like that the fine
finish<00:01:32.880> has<00:01:33.600> variable<00:01:34.200> speed<00:01:34.640> which<00:01:35.640> again<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
finish has variable speed which again is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.550 
finish has variable speed which again is
nice<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.600> dial<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.439> you're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
nice you can dial it down if you're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
nice you can dial it down if you're
going<00:01:37.799> inside<00:01:38.100> things<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> lot

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
going inside things and don't want a lot

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.440 
going inside things and don't want a lot
of<00:01:39.180> bounce<00:01:39.450> back<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.979> maxes<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.670> 1500

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
of bounce back but it maxes out at 1500

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.350 
of bounce back but it maxes out at 1500
psi<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.189> doesn't<00:01:44.549> move<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> acrylic

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
psi so it doesn't move the acrylic

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
psi so it doesn't move the acrylic
primer<00:01:45.509> quite<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.439> easily<00:01:46.920> it'll<00:01:47.280> definitely

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
primer quite as easily it'll definitely

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.499 
primer quite as easily it'll definitely
do<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.259> pro<00:01:49.500> shot<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.130> original<00:01:50.579> will

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
do it but the pro shot the original will

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.670 
do it but the pro shot the original will
blow<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> no<00:01:51.960> problem<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.210> I'm<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.360> gonna<00:01:54.680> get

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
blow it no problem so I'm just gonna get

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.359 
blow it no problem so I'm just gonna get
masked<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.860> take<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> shot<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.250> these

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
masked up here and take a shot at these

00:01:59.369 --> 00:03:36.170 
masked up here and take a shot at these
things

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.240 

okay<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.450> started<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.200> run<00:03:38.350> low<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.740> product

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
okay so I started to run low on product
