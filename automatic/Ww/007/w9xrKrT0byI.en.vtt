00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.440
 the close encounter 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 by the silent well-known space 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.869
 outside getting closer and closer up 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.810
 reach the third planet of the system 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.020
 solar the planet of the system we are 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.330
 us bypassing the control networks 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.030
 of the earth entering the atmosphere and 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.390
 He headed his way to the cabin 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.600
 the chapel that place in the chapel 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.400
 water and this is science fiction is not mine 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 It is not real water but it does not mean that it does not 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.070
 happen it's true you 're right it 's okay 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.960
 very soon the unsuspecting terry does not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.320
 the have a close encounter of 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.050
 third type when I do not meet 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.150
 close of that type is an expression 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.790
 used by UFO researchers 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.830
 well this no close encounter of 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.090
 first type is when they discover traces 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.180
 physical of a UFO 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 a close encounter of the second type is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.400
 when they manage to see a man and a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.159
 close encounter of the third type is 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.860
 when they come into contact with man 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.870
 I hope to have only far meetings 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 good 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.799
 I'm going to replace something to monitor the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.680
 money to finish 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.860
 but we must take care of the chickens and it's my 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.860
 turn 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.880
 well at least we know what the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.409
 Close encounters from first to third 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.110
 I'm wondering if there's a fourth guy 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.170
 in jamis from close encounters 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.210
 fourth type that's when the lombi 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.220
 they invite you to a Chinese restaurant there 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.680
 from a close encounter of the fifth type 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.580
 which is when the omnia its limitation of 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.770
 civilians that is heel for you 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.540
 there has to be some way that I 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.540
 I can get some chickens 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.600
 d 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.900
 just a musical star 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.160
 they would not like to scare them so that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.500
 return to your planet 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.270
 I am a leading scientist and I can 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.870
 give them a plan to scare away the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:35.459
 space invaders what they need 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:37.890
 is where indeed the second part of the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.800
 hen cooperation plan that there is a 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.930
 close encounter of the nineteenth type 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.970
 That's when the lime trees have me 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.819
 elderly wrestling apologize or a 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 person of scientific type or I came here 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.290
 in search of flying saucers 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.790
 of the Queen 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.750
 and it is that here there are flying saucers of 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.730
 I'm still not sure if I can 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.150
 tell them how they can scare those 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.150
 same 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.750
 but what flames deceptions racionero like 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.120
 is it not occur to me and wait where 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.780
 more with that trash can one wants 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.530
 so that tin paper 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.530
 with those empty cans 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.550
 I'm saying I have to stay 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.710
 take care of the money 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:44.080
 I just hope that what you plan to do is not 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:45.730
 cause some problem will cause the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.220
 subjects of the flying saucers 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.680
 will have a meeting of the 26th type 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.920
 I do not know I can not see from the time the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.660
 with all this stationery as a 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000
 baked potato 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.900
 it's a close encounter of the seventieth 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.939
 first type 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.170
 is when the corn is preparing 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.319
 cheese castles for all 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.319
 neighborhood 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.900
 for this 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:37.500
 and well what do I do if we can chase away 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.500
 other teams 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.719
 we are from another benita 

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:49.169
 we have already conquered a land 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:53.960
 we have already conquered the earth 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.520
 if you remember live invasion 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.190
 we have invasion forces that 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.130
 they come direct and here it is not clear 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.270
 this is the end for the earth or worse to go 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.270
 to tell orson 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.290
 this is the earth and it is the last 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.290
 template that we have 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.270
 they say that being there you have to prove it 

00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:33.909
 family that these little conflicts 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.909
 they were going to be beneficial 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.939
 while our planet we 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.939
 we saw first one has 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.410
 the idea of â€‹â€‹dressing up like that 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.750
 he knew the scientific idea and he knew the 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.440
 same idea and what did his 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.440
 scientific 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.920
 This has been a trick to get away from 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.920
 hen house 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:12.000
 the brightest idea stand aside 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.639
 prawns, say stop, do not try 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.330
 that stupid spatial routine with me 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:22.310
 I invented it now get out of my way no 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.310
 they can fool anyone 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.510
 and it's turned into a block of ice 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.550
 now in permanent character in the 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.550
 program until the next ice 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.160
 maybe they will be space invaders 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.500
 really 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.770
 Last not really exist 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:54.370
 flying saucers how do you explain this 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.370
 tasty nador are I can not 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.130
 yes
