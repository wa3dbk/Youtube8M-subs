00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.250
 instead of the noise of over 100 aircraft a day around Hahn Airport 

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:05.080
 hunsrÃ¼ck 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.900
 at best, construction noise interrogation 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.999
 Sharing itself has been allowed to start or land since Monday 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.499
 because the slopes needed urgently a new surface for the work in the 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.080
 Timetable remain it in these minutes the first airplane again roles 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:22.129
 until then, the tunnels were dominated by 1 Calvin wants to be a teacher 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.220
 the machines of the airline stationed here at Hahn Airport on the ground 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.800
 Seeing passengers on the Internet far and wide 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 High traffic on the runway 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.480
 Project manager Hermann Anton can be summoned by senior site manager Tomas Maier to the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.020
 latest state of affairs will bring 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.170
 - What was your belly Oliver were twice 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.780
 it is unfamiliar 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990
 "That is very nice 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.490
 It is a mega-project that is going to happen at Hahn Airport 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.870
 Six so-called road pavers run in parallel 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.049
 15 rollers and 90 articulated lorries are in use 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.229
 to equip the runway with new passport drops 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.030
 What is the special charm of this project? 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.670
 and the big role 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.580
 Area has become a club in a short time this tonnage 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.340
 Only at airports 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.760
 even freeways are in ships for much longer time 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.610
 planned 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.750
 It was the first construction schedule of the hourly 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 has been set up here by us round by the day or by the week goes 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.050
 that for biting peasants 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.039
 20,000 tonnes of asphalt are used here 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.070
 new surface for the nearly four-kilometer-long railway 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.660
 for the workers actually routine the handles in normal road construction already 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.250
 executed countless times 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.940
 we use ordinary streets bristle soon like smoking highways 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.170
 Construction is used 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.450
 because it had become so warm 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.310
 the stories in front of me 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.790
 we are building two layers here we are building a binder 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.790
 Thickness of 9 centimeters is covered what is called 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.380
 it sounds so easy 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.440
 but the project is a very special challenge 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.770
 everything Wittlich everything that can be done in just 67 hours 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.640
 That's why the work is scheduled to run around the clock after almost three days of construction 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.630
 Here again jets start and land the new asphalt sledge track 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.019
 the coordination 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.949
 not an easy task 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.359
 300 people are killed on the construction site 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.529
 The construction site runs over 24 hours, which means it is also closed at night 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.019
 Percent at 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.530
 not worked so well lighting and percent there it can stop 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.339
 always opened mass accident com 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.280
 nothing has happened yet 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.270
 not a matter of course with so many simultaneous workings 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 and always the clock 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.129
 you can start at the earliest beginning 4 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.869
 the consumption becomes 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.759
 they sing home travel dangerous places they are not submitted 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.459
 become 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.899
 that interest you 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.889
 that will be in Nendeln 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.849
 have to drive on the already cool numbers of the train 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.859
 otherwise the schedule could not be kept 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.829
 here it just find the surveying sports per cent 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.229
 so to precisely pinpoint the 4 points to putting in the new yet only fire 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.669
 what you also drill when drilling 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.309
 the conduits the 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.759
 in the lower range percent are that you meet them exactly 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.729
 so you can sell these fires from the outside 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.069
 the so-called under landing fire popularly called landing lights 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.729
 A total of 570 will arrive on the newly asphalted area 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:46.650
 for the electrician, that means cabling 570 times initially 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.650
 have to make new holes 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.209
 it is already aligned 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.499
 the midline 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.499
 this is a normal spruce yet 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.099
 already in April 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.779
 while the ash cloud was hanging over Europe at the hunsrÃ¼ck airport the 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.329
 Used favor of the hour and renewed a first part of the railway 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.820
 The renovation costs around one million euros 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.079
 and should last for 15 years 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.570
 since Monday afternoon 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.579
 More than 300 construction workers ensured this around the clock 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.449
 this is a blessing 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.930
 start and land planes again
