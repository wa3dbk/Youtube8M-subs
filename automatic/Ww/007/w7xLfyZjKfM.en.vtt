 Today, AYUMI BURGER KIDZ is featuring this store, San Francisco Peaks! 

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:23.327
 Let's go in! 

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:44.828
 San Francisco Peaks 3-28-7 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 03-5775-5707 http://www.sf-peaks.com/ 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:55.665
 It's very refreshing to be there What I like about San Francisco Peaks is their terrace seats on the 2nd floor. 

00:00:56.414 --> 00:01:02.951
 I would recommend everyone to come to the restaurant in a sunny day and have lunch 

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:09.834
 As for the first floor, these sofas are so colorful and cute. 

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:16.902
 And I also like these lightings. These give the place a beautiful atmosphere. 

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:21.512
 Of course, their hamburgers are delicious! 

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:32.801
 And their burger patties have so much flavor, in other words, those patties are so meaty! And I like that. 

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:42.100
 I would like to order my favorite San Francisco Peaks dish 

00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:44.410
 It's called Mushroom Mozzarella Burger 

00:01:56.914 --> 00:01:58.760
 Thank you so much! 

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:03.050
 Here it is! 

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:06.400
 Looks yummy! 

00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:16.060
 About San Francisco Peaks burgers. San Francisco Peaks carefully barbeques The burger patties to deliver their own flavor. Their burgers use only fresh vegetables; lettuce, tomato and onion, making the dish a great way to enjoy the new ideas! 

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.050
 I've got a photo! 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.470
 I'm in love with hamburgers 

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:54.540
 Because we are filming an episode of AYUMI BURGER KIDZ today, I decided to wear a jacket that has a burger patterned lining 

00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:59.000
 I got this from a british brand. 

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:05.520
 Since it's already September and I wanted to give my outfit a fall vibe, I decided to put on a beanie. 

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:12.290
 I'm wearing my beloved Converse shoes and created a casual outfit. 

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:23.870
 Let's eat! 

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:32.550
 Yep, they provide burger bags 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.750
 These buns feel soft! 

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:43.690
 I'm gonna try this! 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.570
 So yummy! 

00:03:56.806 --> 00:04:12.520
 What I like about this mushroom burger is that it uses several kinds of mushrooms. They use 3 different ones. 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.810
 The combination of mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and meat patty tastes good! 

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:30.100
 Also it's not too greasy. This tastes beautiful. This burger is healthy with many mushrooms and vegetables. 

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.070
 Definitely! 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.420
 Or .. I have a milkshake occasional but I always come back to these soft drinks. 

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:52.550
 The color of melon soda is cute I tend to order coca cola a lot but I started drinking melon soda as well. 

00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:56.490
 I selected melon soda this time 

00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:15.180
 San Francisco Peaks Mushroom Mozzarella Burger

00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:53.510
 I started getting asked to introduced good hamburger places since I mentioned that I love hamburgers. 

00:05:54.462 --> 00:06:00.450
 I could go to new and favorite favorite burger places 

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:03.450
