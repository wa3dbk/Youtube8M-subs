edition<00:00:08.760> drivers<00:00:09.469> I've<00:00:10.469> got<00:00:10.650> two<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:10.980> me

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
edition drivers I've got two with me

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.200 
edition drivers I've got two with me
actually<00:00:11.219> both<00:00:11.580> with<00:00:11.790> slightly<00:00:12.090> different

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
actually both with slightly different

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.089 
actually both with slightly different
shafts<00:00:12.719> but<00:00:13.559> I've<00:00:13.650> got<00:00:13.769> eight<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> half

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
shafts but I've got eight and a half

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.849 
shafts but I've got eight and a half
degrees<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.880> loft<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.619> actually<00:00:16.619> coming<00:00:16.830> out

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
degrees of loft on actually coming out

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.000 
degrees of loft on actually coming out
slightly<00:00:17.250> less<00:00:17.580> than<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:18.439> one's<00:00:19.439> got<00:00:19.590> DMI<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
slightly less than that one's got DMI on

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.060 
slightly less than that one's got DMI on
a<00:00:20.100> shaft<00:00:20.449> and<00:00:21.449> one's<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.350> shaft<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.830> here

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
a shaft and one's got this shaft in here

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
a shaft and one's got this shaft in here
so<00:00:23.250> I've<00:00:23.369> been<00:00:23.490> testing<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.150> week<00:00:24.390> since

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so I've been testing this week since

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.439 
so I've been testing this week since
I've<00:00:24.960> been<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.949> Dubai<00:00:26.340> trying<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> see

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I've been in in Dubai trying out to see

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.460 
I've been in in Dubai trying out to see
which<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.750> works<00:00:27.900> best<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.609> at<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> moment

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
which one works best so at the moment

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
which one works best so at the moment
depends<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> conditions<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.610> windy

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
depends on the conditions if it's windy

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.280 
depends on the conditions if it's windy
I'll<00:00:33.210> probably<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> deer<00:00:33.989> monitor

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I'll probably go with the deer monitor

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.510 
I'll probably go with the deer monitor
because<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.620> gets<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.920> slightly<00:00:35.160> flatter

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
because it just gets a slightly flatter

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400 
because it just gets a slightly flatter
ball<00:00:35.760> flight<00:00:36.030> whereas<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.930> flat<00:00:37.140> calm

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ball flight whereas if it's flat calm

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
ball flight whereas if it's flat calm
and<00:00:37.620> I'll<00:00:37.860> probably<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> other

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and I'll probably go to the to the other

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
and I'll probably go to the to the other
one<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.989> good<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.410> picked<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.670> from

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one really good I picked this up from

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.130 
one really good I picked this up from
the<00:00:42.000> boys<00:00:42.180> last<00:00:42.510> year<00:00:43.219> 15<00:00:44.219> degree<00:00:45.140> slightly

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the boys last year 15 degree slightly

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.779 
the boys last year 15 degree slightly
different<00:00:46.379> shaft<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.399> would

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
different shaft that I would I would

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930 
different shaft that I would I would
normally<00:00:48.149> use<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.629> actually<00:00:49.200> tried<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.940> hybrid

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
normally use I actually tried the hybrid

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
normally use I actually tried the hybrid
out<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> reading<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> hybrid<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.640> Pacific

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
out and reading I'm a hybrid and Pacific

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.010 
out and reading I'm a hybrid and Pacific
guys<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:53.940> switch<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> shafts<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
guys could switch the shafts into the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.689 
guys could switch the shafts into the
three<00:00:55.260> wooden<00:00:55.469> I've<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> three<00:00:56.460> written

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
three wooden I've got the three written

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.920 
three wooden I've got the three written
really<00:00:56.850> nice<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.600> been<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really nice and so that's been in the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.959 
really nice and so that's been in the
back<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.309> while<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.609> really

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
back for for a little while now really

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
back for for a little while now really
like<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.359> gone<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> two<00:01:01.410> irons<00:01:01.680> now<00:01:01.859> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
like that gone are the two irons now I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
like that gone are the two irons now I
think<00:01:02.789> everyone's<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.870> switching

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
think everyone's pretty much switching

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
think everyone's pretty much switching
to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> hybrid<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> 18<00:01:06.750> degree<00:01:07.049> VR

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to the hybrid so you have a 18 degree VR

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.670 
to the hybrid so you have a 18 degree VR
pro<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.229> it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
pro just really like it's it's it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.270 
pro just really like it's it's it's
really<00:01:10.860> good

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
really good

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.330 
really good
like<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> said<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> same<00:01:12.510> shaft<00:01:13.280> as<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
like I said it's got the same shaft as I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.240 
like I said it's got the same shaft as I
have<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.670> 3-wood<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.770> one's<00:01:17.009> slightly

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
have my 3-wood and this one's slightly

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
have my 3-wood and this one's slightly
different<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> first<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> had

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
different to the to the first one I had

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
different to the to the first one I had
I<00:01:19.170> felt<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> first<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.250> little

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I felt like the first one was a little

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
I felt like the first one was a little
bit<00:01:20.850> too<00:01:21.000> strong<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.689> slightly<00:01:21.900> weak<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
bit too strong so it's slightly weak and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.770 
bit too strong so it's slightly weak and
this<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.740> gets<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:24.000> nice<00:01:24.240> ball<00:01:24.479> fly<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this one gets a really nice ball fly it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.530 
this one gets a really nice ball fly it
comes<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.470> high<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.040> soft<00:01:26.540> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
comes in very high and soft and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.850 
comes in very high and soft and
obviously<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> main<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
obviously the main thing is it goes the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
obviously the main thing is it goes the
right<00:01:29.009> distance<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
right distance that I want it to so so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.120 
right distance that I want it to so so
I'm<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.259> happy<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:31.740> pleased<00:01:31.979> with

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I'm really happy really pleased with

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429

vPro irons but the shinier finished to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.249 
vPro irons but the shinier finished to
them<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.090> last<00:01:45.360> set<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.689> eyes<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> was

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
them and my last set of eyes that I was

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
them and my last set of eyes that I was
using<00:01:46.439> had<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> slightly<00:01:47.310> duller<00:01:47.579> finish<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
using had a slightly duller finish to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
using had a slightly duller finish to
them<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.540> I've<00:01:48.960> got<00:01:49.140> Pete<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.530> guys<00:01:49.710> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
them so I've got Pete and the guys to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
them so I've got Pete and the guys to
slightly<00:01:50.490> dull<00:01:50.729> off<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> finish<00:01:51.299> which<00:01:51.509> just

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
slightly dull off the finish which just

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
slightly dull off the finish which just
takes<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.530> glare<00:01:52.740> out<00:01:52.799> if

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
takes the little bit of glare out if

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
takes the little bit of glare out if
it's<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> real<00:01:54.930> sunny<00:01:55.229> day<00:01:55.439> today

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
it's like a like a real sunny day today

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's like a like a real sunny day today
but<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.360> they've<00:01:57.479> done<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
but really like what they've done and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.969 
but really like what they've done and
they<00:01:57.960> seem<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.320> performing<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.860> well

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
they seem to be performing really well

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.069 
they seem to be performing really well
so<00:01:59.280> far<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.700> me<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.689> liked<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> look

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
so far for me so really liked the look

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.870 
so far for me so really liked the look
and<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.380> feel<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> feel<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and the feel and they just feel like a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.399 
and the feel and they just feel like a
really<00:02:03.149> solid<00:02:03.329> blade<00:02:05.390> always<00:02:06.390> played<00:02:06.600> x100s

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
really solid blade always played x100s

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.919 
really solid blade always played x100s
all<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:07.770> life<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.239> stuck<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.450> their<00:02:09.690> start

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
all my life so stuck with their start

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.680 
all my life so stuck with their start
with<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.080> X<00:02:10.970> 147

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
with the X 147

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.360 
with the X 147
and<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:14.210> 60/40<00:02:15.210> 750<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.710> chrome<00:02:16.980> finishes

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and a 60/40 750 for the chrome finishes

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690 
and a 60/40 750 for the chrome finishes
I<00:02:18.300> did<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.890> rusty<00:02:20.220> ones<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.550> there

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
I did have the rusty ones in there

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
I did have the rusty ones in there
before<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.570> felt<00:02:21.960> like<00:02:22.200> they<00:02:22.950> were

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
before but just felt like they were

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.410 
before but just felt like they were
probably<00:02:23.250> spinning<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:23.850> bit<00:02:23.970> too<00:02:24.180> much

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
probably spinning a little bit too much

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.890 
probably spinning a little bit too much
for<00:02:24.630> me

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
for me

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
for me
so<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.680> spoke<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.130> Pete<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.490> robbing<00:02:26.760> them<00:02:26.910> they

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
so I spoke to Pete and robbing them they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.820 
so I spoke to Pete and robbing them they
went<00:02:27.570> away<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.810> gave<00:02:28.470> me<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> different

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
went away and gave me a different

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
went away and gave me a different
options<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.700> tried<00:02:30.030> these<00:02:30.210> out<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.690> they

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
options so I tried these out and they

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
options so I tried these out and they
seem<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.230> taking<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.680> spin<00:02:31.890> off<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.130> ball

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
seem to be taking the spin off the ball

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
seem to be taking the spin off the ball
a<00:02:32.520> lot<00:02:32.910> more<00:02:33.120> which<00:02:33.300> which<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.690> helps

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
a lot more which which really helps

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.890 
a lot more which which really helps
because<00:02:34.350> I'm<00:02:34.470> quite<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.860> high<00:02:35.040> spin<00:02:35.340> player<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
because I'm quite a high spin player and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.230 
because I'm quite a high spin player and
then<00:02:37.080> obviously<00:02:37.650> probably<00:02:38.460> one<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.820> best

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
then obviously probably one of the best

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.900 
then obviously probably one of the best
clubs<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.660> magnitude<00:02:40.440> agree<00:02:40.910> been

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
clubs in the magnitude agree been

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.240 
clubs in the magnitude agree been
testing<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> few<00:02:42.360> out<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> new<00:02:43.920> one<00:02:44.100> with

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
testing a few out this is a new one with

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.430 
testing a few out this is a new one with
a<00:02:44.280> slightly<00:02:44.610> more<00:02:44.850> aggressive<00:02:44.970> face<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.870> so

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
a slightly more aggressive face to it so

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080 
a slightly more aggressive face to it so
this<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.950> does<00:02:47.220> spin<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.640> ball<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
this really does spin the ball and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.790 
this really does spin the ball and
especially<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.750> me<00:02:48.900> around<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.410> Greens<00:02:49.680> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
especially for me around the Greens I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.710 
especially for me around the Greens I
use<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> lob<00:02:50.280> wedge<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.550> hell<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.820> lot<00:02:51.000> yep<00:02:51.210> got

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
use a lob wedge a hell of a lot yep got

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.910 
use a lob wedge a hell of a lot yep got
a<00:02:52.470> nice<00:02:53.220> job<00:02:53.520> leave<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.270> as<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.720> double<00:02:54.960> o1<00:02:55.500> but

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
a nice job leave it as a double o1 but

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.610 
a nice job leave it as a double o1 but
it's<00:02:56.700> been<00:02:56.940> kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.750> specially<00:02:58.170> designed<00:02:58.500> for

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's been kind of specially designed for

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.840 
it's been kind of specially designed for
me<00:02:58.740> because<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.460> shape<00:02:59.490> of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
me because I really like the shape of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.440 
me because I really like the shape of
like<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:01.560> old-school<00:03:01.860> answer<00:03:02.460> Stipe<00:03:02.760> type

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
like the old-school answer Stipe type

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.470 
like the old-school answer Stipe type
style<00:03:03.870> shape<00:03:04.170> cutter<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.340> spoke<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:05.970> Pete

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
style shape cutter so I spoke to Pete

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.810 
style shape cutter so I spoke to Pete
and<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.140> guys<00:03:07.440> went<00:03:07.770> away<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.010> designed

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
and the guys went away and designed

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.970 
and the guys went away and designed
something<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.210> picked<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.540> up<00:03:09.600> last<00:03:10.410> week<00:03:10.710> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
something I picked this up last week and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
something I picked this up last week and
just<00:03:11.430> absolutely<00:03:11.790> loved<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.300> I've<00:03:12.390> been

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
just absolutely loved it so I've been

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.910 
just absolutely loved it so I've been
practicing<00:03:12.930> with<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> last<00:03:13.440> four<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:13.710> five

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
practicing with it the last four or five

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.950 
practicing with it the last four or five
days<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.940> know<00:03:15.060> love<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> look<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
days you know love the look of it the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.350 
days you know love the look of it the
feels<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.739> good<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:18.120> know<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.330> just

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
feels really good and you know it just

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.330 
feels really good and you know it just
seems<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.840> get<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.020> ball<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.739> with<00:03:20.100> the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
seems to get the ball with with the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.220 
seems to get the ball with with the
combination<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> putter<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
combination of the of the putter and the
