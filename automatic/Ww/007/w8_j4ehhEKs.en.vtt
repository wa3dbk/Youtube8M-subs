00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.040
 the girl today the video will be quickly 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'm enjoying that organizing the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.520
 cooking putting things in order 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.869
 So in recording this video for you, it's me. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 I do not know if you know but I live in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 My apartment apartment is not much 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 Big and my kitchen is well 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.560
 small then all the space like that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.300
 May it come out very welcome, I always 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.730
 have to look somehow somehow 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 way to have a box 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.399
 thing here died there but everything works out 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.899
 and I'm going to show you a little video now 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.320
 For you , how was mine? 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
 dispense before organizing and then I go 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.280
 show you how she stayed later 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 to organize dinho I hope it helps 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.440
 You like Kaka, remembering that I do not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.730
 I gain nothing from any brand that looks like 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.699
 my dispensation 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.690
 are things that I like that are more 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.790
 cheap and she's pretty empty because it already 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 It's time to shop, but it's 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.320
 right now that I like 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.390
 to sort or litter in order to receive 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.290
 the purchase then continue watching 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.290
 hope you like it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 so after it's organized, I love it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 It looks like it has given more 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.700
 but really because I believe that I 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 has gained a little space and is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.110
 I already left to do this when I'm 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 close to shopping you can already win 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.270
 space even there it stayed so up there is 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.510
 There are products here that are still 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.650
 closed has no sugar flour 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.230
 of tapioca and my husband makes the products 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.950
 that I will use but are not yet in 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.630
 use 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.010
 and today I can leave a 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.160
 in these little pots here 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.080
 so can advice can see them 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.380
 are all edited 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.820
 I'd rather not leave when using a 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.670
 the product does not leave the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.290
 Pack a customer who likes 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.660
 to put an end to the accident that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.700
 There were people who put a 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.340
 But I prefer to put it this way. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.970
 because otherwise I'll ride all the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.240
 packages and went they were them all day 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.070
 It's bigger so I put it like a brick 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.620
 7 Quiet to know what is there is something 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.520
 It is obvious that neither does it as soon as it has 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.080
 thing so they are more similar then 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.470
 sometimes in hurry we can 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.840
 deceive and underneath it image of each 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.770
 I put the expiration date on 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.570
 It comes not only that there in that little corner I 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.560
 I put the things you use to 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.959
 make tea 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.900
 they are like that more in the corner in 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.810
 part of the top because the few then 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.390
 There's charlie's box on the bottom here. 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:23.650
 there are people in flower also making tea and so 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.709
 it was the right top part 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.830
 I put on a little surrender just to give a 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.010
 I think that the house of the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.950
 People and we have to stay, our face has to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.830
 stay a tasty place here from 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.470
 down I made that first pot like that 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.480
 I put the things is that I will 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.480
 say to prepare the drink then you have 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.200

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:01.760
 microwave popcorn packs 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.819
 In this one I put the cans and seasonings 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.090
 so we do not have to prepare the food 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.030
 but so grated pepper cheese 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.610

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:20.030

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.700
 that it is very empty because it is already in the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:31.100
 then it was time for me to do but 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.830
 I put chocolate nutella biscuits 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.020
 then all the cookies will stay here. 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.540

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.340

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.440
 and in this last one I put everything 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.960

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.690
 do not have coconut milk is granulated coconut 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.950
 condensed milk or cream is the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.810
 spreadsheet 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.460
 so I know everything to make a cake. 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.889

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.789
 If you do not have it here, then you do not have it. 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.740

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.050

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:14.080

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.690

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.940
 I hope it even helped you guys. 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.220
 this video is the way I 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.039
 organization is the way I think it stands 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.470
 easier for me to my husband here 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.539
 at home but you have to look for the 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.450
 agent becomes easier for you more 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:36.500
 then a patient is not staying 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.389
 but it is easy and organized and the 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.830
