2 ma and half step two on the e okay at

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.610 
2 ma and half step two on the e okay at
25<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.250> have<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.400> marcado<00:00:40.970> bow<00:00:41.390> mm-hmm<00:00:42.350> now<00:00:42.560> the

25 you have a marcado bow mm-hmm now the
marcado<00:00:43.070> bow<00:00:43.400> is<00:00:43.780> different<00:00:44.780> than<00:00:44.990> a<00:00:45.020> regular

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
marcado bow is different than a regular

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.080 
marcado bow is different than a regular
bowed<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.920> regular<00:00:46.220> bow<00:00:46.400> we<00:00:46.700> would<00:00:46.940> be

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
bowed the regular bow we would be

bowed the regular bow we would be
playing<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:50.830> marcado<00:00:51.830> bow<00:00:52.190> would<00:00:52.550> be<00:00:52.730> heavier

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
playing the marcado bow would be heavier

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.060 
playing the marcado bow would be heavier
and<00:00:53.750> quicker<00:00:54.260> bow<00:00:54.590> stroke<00:00:59.680> okay<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:00.740> that's

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
and quicker bow stroke okay so that's

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.240 
and quicker bow stroke okay so that's
gonna<00:01:01.220> happen<00:01:01.490> at<00:01:01.550> 25<00:01:02.060> and<00:01:02.390> 57<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:03.980> just<00:01:04.129> be

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
gonna happen at 25 and 57 so just be

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.070

slowdown<00:01:06.700> down<00:01:07.700> there<00:01:07.969> at<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.149> last<00:01:08.420> line<00:01:08.810> 79

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
slowdown down there at the last line 79

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.590 
slowdown down there at the last line 79
and<00:01:09.829> 80<00:01:10.039> you<00:01:10.549> can't<00:01:10.759> really<00:01:10.880> tell<00:01:11.149> but<00:01:11.179> there's
