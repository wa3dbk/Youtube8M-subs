you how to kind of incorporate this into

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.070 
you how to kind of incorporate this into
something<00:00:08.639> other<00:00:08.880> than<00:00:09.059> just<00:00:09.240> like<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.510> bossa

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
something other than just like the bossa

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:42.620 
something other than just like the bossa
nova<00:00:10.559> we'll<00:00:11.550> check<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.360> out

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.410 

so<00:00:43.630> basically<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.470> can<00:00:44.500> use<00:00:45.130> this<00:00:45.430> 69<00:00:45.880> wherever

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
so basically I can use this 69 wherever

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.360 
so basically I can use this 69 wherever
I<00:00:46.480> would<00:00:46.690> use<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:46.960> regular<00:00:47.320> old<00:00:47.680> Secord

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
I would use a regular old Secord

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.250 
I would use a regular old Secord
really<00:00:48.790> important<00:00:49.390> note<00:00:49.630> well<00:00:49.930> I'm<00:00:49.990> gonna<00:00:50.110> say

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
really important note well I'm gonna say

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.290 
really important note well I'm gonna say

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
that again you can use the six nine

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.300 
that again you can use the six nine
chord<00:00:52.690> wherever<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.290> would<00:00:53.410> have<00:00:53.650> just<00:00:54.190> a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
add nine

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.570 

so<00:01:38.720> I'm<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:38.930> adding<00:01:39.260> this<00:01:39.620> denote<00:01:40.220> which<00:01:40.430> is

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
so I'm just adding this denote which is

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.900 
so I'm just adding this denote which is
the<00:01:40.730> knife<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.480> then<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.200> c69<00:01:42.980> notice<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.640> keep

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
the knife and then the c69 notice I keep

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.840 
the knife and then the c69 notice I keep
the<00:01:44.150> D<00:01:44.390> I'm<00:01:44.870> just<00:01:45.260> playing<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.190> G<00:01:46.430> here<00:01:46.670> and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
the D I'm just playing the G here and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.350 
the D I'm just playing the G here and
that<00:01:46.940> I'm<00:01:47.030> adding<00:01:47.890> that's<00:01:48.890> sixth<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.210> that's

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
that I'm adding that's sixth and that's

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
that I'm adding that's sixth and that's
what<00:01:50.510> makes<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.810> sound<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.170> little<00:01:51.200> bit

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
what makes it sound a little bit

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.240 
what makes it sound a little bit
different<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:51.770> C<00:01:52.130> add<00:01:52.430> nine

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.740 

and<00:01:55.340> then<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.000> c69

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
and then the c69

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.400 
and then the c69
really<00:01:59.590> close<00:01:59.980> really<00:02:00.970> close<00:02:01.330> in<00:02:01.780> fact<00:02:02.230> I

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
really close really close in fact I

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.440 
really close really close in fact I
could<00:02:02.560> play<00:02:02.740> AC<00:02:02.980> adenine<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:03.550> this

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
could play AC adenine like this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.589 
could play AC adenine like this
because<00:02:06.049> G<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.470> part<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.860> chord<00:02:07.130> right<00:02:07.599> so

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
because G is part of the chord right so

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.150 
because G is part of the chord right so
this<00:02:08.720> could<00:02:08.899> technically<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.349> called<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.739> C<00:02:09.979> add

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
this could technically be called a C add

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.309 
this could technically be called a C add
nine<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.729> then<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:11.120> make<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.480> c6<00:02:11.900> all<00:02:12.290> I

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
nine and then to make it to c6 all I

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.740 
nine and then to make it to c6 all I
would<00:02:12.590> need<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.800> do<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.360> flatten<00:02:14.360> out<00:02:14.599> this

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
would need to do is flatten out this

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.699 
would need to do is flatten out this
finger<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.550> grab<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.760> six

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
finger and grab the six

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.550 
finger and grab the six
I've<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.430> gone<00:02:19.579> from<00:02:21.819> okay<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.599> one<00:02:24.500> more

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I've just gone from okay so one more

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.610 
I've just gone from okay so one more
