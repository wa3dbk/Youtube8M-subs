00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.630
 us a team about or new york 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.849
 role play presentation 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.680
 dark souls 2 from from software 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.960
 developers have shown on a number of examples 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.029
 that the game remained true to its ideal 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.189
 predecessors still difficult and not 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.930
 forgives mistakes death can be here 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.640
 wait for any angle and even with 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.119
 common opponents do not relax 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.520
 worth 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.379
 kill in a couple of seconds according to 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.300
 authors they had to focus on 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.280
 the fact that the project did not come off the roots 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.719
 as many misinterpreted them 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.920
 previous statements that dark souls 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.289
 will become more accessible 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.539
 they convince no simplification 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.760
 they will go and just make the game more 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.890
 clear and convenient for example less 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.390
 time spent on tedious running around in 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.739
 the first dark souls the hero got 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.690
 able to teleport between 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.570
 save points only in the middle of the game 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.190
 here it is the very beginning of the location 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.109
 now designed so that player 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.360
 can explore them more freely 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.370
 however, no one will lead him by the hand 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.680
 the plot still fall bit by bit 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.600
 who need to add mosaics themselves 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.759
 more obvious become upgrade weapons 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.259
 the combat system itself is practically not 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.210
 changed except instead of a shield 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.219
 allowed to take the torch to defend against 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.689
 attacks in this case, but heavier 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.799
 less risk to stumble upon any 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.960
 trap in the dark 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.790
 enemies dark souls 2 often surprise 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.250
 unexpected tricks forcing 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.780
 change tactics say if you decide on 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.030
 old archery shoot healthy 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.890
 which is grate it can rage 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.170
 tear down and along with a piece of wall and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.060
 rush on you new engine which 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.340
 From the software used 2 parts 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 made the game noticeably more beautiful than the original 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.240
 while the developers got rid of 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.369
 problems with falling frame rate clogged 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.460
 The authors who gave earlier confirmed that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.450
 dark souls 2 will be released on pc and xbox 360 and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.700

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.730
 this time, first make a version 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.320
 for staff 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.180
 and only they will be repelled by it. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.740
 in order to port to others 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.200
 platforms on the console next 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.330
 generations the Japanese decided not to threaten 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.890
 release date however is not yet called 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
 common phrases about improvements 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.550
 get off and about questions about 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.470
 multiplayer known in one world 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.470
