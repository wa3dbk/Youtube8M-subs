00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.460

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
you'd deployables one shot kills stuff

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.600 
you'd deployables one shot kills stuff
like<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:48.350> after<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.470> I'll<00:00:49.980> show<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> how

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
using a little gold glitch it's never

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.290 
using a little gold glitch it's never
done<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> glitch<00:01:46.360> but<00:01:47.910> what<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.060> they'll

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
done a glitch but what is they'll

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.430 
done a glitch but what is they'll
usually<00:01:50.460> stop<00:01:51.460> right<00:01:51.790> around<00:01:52.060> here<00:01:53.940> but<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
usually stop right around here but the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.840 
usually stop right around here but the
jump<00:01:56.440> was<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.649> little<00:01:56.890> sloppy<00:01:57.130> or<00:01:57.460> something<00:01:57.759> I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
jump was a little sloppy or something I

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.639 
jump was a little sloppy or something I
don't<00:01:57.910> know<00:01:58.119> they'll<00:01:58.990> stop<00:01:59.229> right<00:01:59.470> around

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
don't know they'll stop right around

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.810 
don't know they'll stop right around
here<00:02:00.009> be<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> little<00:02:01.060> closer<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:02.340> try<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.490> redo

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
here be a little closer I try and redo

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.200 
here be a little closer I try and redo
it<00:02:03.970> at<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.450> end<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.899> mission<00:02:05.649> or<00:02:06.040> at<00:02:06.759> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
it at the end of the mission or at the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.840 
it at the end of the mission or at the
end<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.450> level<00:02:07.660> if<00:02:07.960> they're<00:02:08.170> right<00:02:08.290> here

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
end of the level if they're right here

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.890 
end of the level if they're right here
that<00:02:09.850> really<00:02:10.840> doesn't<00:02:11.080> matter<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that really doesn't matter and just to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.260 
that really doesn't matter and just to
be<00:02:14.080> careful<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.489> lot<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.450> times<00:02:18.270> if

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
be careful is that a lot of times if

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.949 
be careful is that a lot of times if
there's<00:02:19.540> any<00:02:19.810> zombies<00:02:20.560> left<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.220> map

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
there's any zombies left on the map

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.230 
there's any zombies left on the map
while<00:02:22.959> you're
