out<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.890> map<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:51.000> assume<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.899> was

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
out of the map now I assume this was

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
out of the map now I assume this was
going<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> da<00:01:52.890> Vinci<00:01:53.250> box

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
going to be some kind of da Vinci box

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
going to be some kind of da Vinci box
then<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.060> flew<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.350> solid<00:01:55.590> box<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
then I flew up to it it's a solid box I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.200 
then I flew up to it it's a solid box I
went<00:01:56.280> back<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.490> checked<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
went back and checked it and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.639 
went back and checked it and
double-checked<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.899> triple-checked<00:01:57.990> it's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
double-checked and triple-checked it's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.350 
double-checked and triple-checked it's
right<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> boundary<00:01:59.280> I've<00:01:59.520> no<00:02:00.030> idea<00:02:00.149> what

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
right on the boundary I've no idea what

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
right on the boundary I've no idea what
it<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.780> probably<00:02:01.110> something<00:02:01.320> incredibly

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it is it's probably something incredibly

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
it is it's probably something incredibly
insignificant<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:03.270> doesn't<00:02:03.659> need<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
insignificant that doesn't need to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.560 
insignificant that doesn't need to
