because he's been poor you know by his

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.210 
because he's been poor you know by his
own<00:00:21.900> admission<00:00:22.050> he'd<00:00:22.500> probably<00:00:22.740> say<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.039> he

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
own admission he'd probably say that he

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.439

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
ability that he can do more and that's

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.650 
ability that he can do more and that's
why<00:00:26.430> we're<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.939> frustrated<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.480> him

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660

here<00:02:12.270> Pedro<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.989> thinks<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.349> pretty<00:02:13.590> close

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
here Pedro you thinks is pretty close

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.350

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
minutes where they make it a little bit

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.880 
minutes where they make it a little bit
of<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.570> mistake<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.140> gonna<00:03:07.320> let<00:03:07.410> him<00:03:07.560> off<00:03:07.680> that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
of a mistake we gonna let him off that

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
of a mistake we gonna let him off that
one<00:03:08.070> because<00:03:08.519> he<00:03:08.760> did<00:03:08.910> get<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.090> vital<00:03:09.420> assist<00:03:09.720> on

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
one because he did get a vital assist on

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
one because he did get a vital assist on
the<00:03:09.989> day<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.290> right<00:03:10.560> at<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.860> death<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.489> thought

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the day and right at the death I thought

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.430 
the day and right at the death I thought
he<00:03:12.330> was<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.750> score<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.380> you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
he was going to score because if you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.360 
he was going to score because if you
look<00:03:13.560> at<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:14.390> Leo<00:03:15.390> Messi<00:03:15.810> here<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.370> between

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
look at this Leo Messi here in between

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.880 
look at this Leo Messi here in between
the<00:03:18.000> two<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:19.049> from<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.470> cross<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
the two and then from the cross that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.110 
the two and then from the cross that
comes<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.310> from<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.549> right<00:03:20.670> hand<00:03:20.850> side<00:03:20.940> here

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
comes in from the right hand side here

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.789 
comes in from the right hand side here
from<00:03:21.390> danea<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.870> thought<00:03:22.350> he<00:03:22.470> was<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.739> to

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
from danea I thought he was going to

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.160 
from danea I thought he was going to
score<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.579> defender<00:03:24.150> takes<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.570> off<00:03:24.690> his<00:03:24.870> toes

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
score the defender takes it off his toes

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.890 
score the defender takes it off his toes
and<00:03:25.470> Pedro<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.640> close<00:03:27.000> yet<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.329> far<00:03:27.600> away

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and Pedro is so close yet so far away

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.960 
and Pedro is so close yet so far away
from<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.380> elusive<00:03:28.860> goal<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:29.940> a

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
from that elusive goal and it was a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.850 
from that elusive goal and it was a
really<00:03:30.239> good<00:03:30.510> display<00:03:30.750> when<00:03:31.019> he<00:03:31.110> come<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.440> and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
really good display when he come on and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.259 
really good display when he come on and
I<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.310> seeing<00:03:32.549> him<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:32.940> because

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
I just like seeing him like that because

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.060 
I just like seeing him like that because
when<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.690> are<00:03:33.810> flashes<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.470> old<00:03:34.680> Pedro

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
when there are flashes of the old Pedro

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.100 
when there are flashes of the old Pedro
it's<00:03:35.310> good<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.880> see<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.600> said<00:03:36.660> if

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
it's good to see because like I said if

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.020 
it's good to see because like I said if
we<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.860> guy<00:03:38.190> coming<00:03:38.640> off<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.880> bench

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
we can get that guy coming off the bench

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.509 
we can get that guy coming off the bench
making<00:03:39.510> an<00:03:39.780> impact<00:03:40.110> changing<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.040> dimension

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
making an impact changing the dimension

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.130 
making an impact changing the dimension
of<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.700> game<00:03:41.880> stretching<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.630> opposition

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
of the game stretching the opposition

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.110 
of the game stretching the opposition
imagine<00:03:43.799> bringing<00:03:43.980> him<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.549> 10<00:03:44.760> 15

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
imagine bringing him on with 10 15
