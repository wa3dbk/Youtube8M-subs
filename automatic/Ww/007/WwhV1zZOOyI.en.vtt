00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.960 
the weapon has so here as you can see
I'm<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.590> shooting<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.310> not<00:01:56.459> zooming<00:01:56.789> in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
I'm just shooting I'm not zooming in

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.600 
I'm just shooting I'm not zooming in
pretty<00:01:57.330> decent<00:01:57.840> rate<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.349> fire<00:01:58.560> ah<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.489> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pretty decent rate of fire ah that's the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.600 
pretty decent rate of fire ah that's the
recoil<00:02:00.179> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> gun<00:02:00.950> here<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.429> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
recoil on the gun here is just the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.729 
recoil on the gun here is just the
recoil<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> hold<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.780> stick<00:02:04.050> down<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:04.739 
recoil if you hold the stick down just a

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.010 
recoil if you hold the stick down just a
little<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.039> it's<00:02:05.550> very<00:02:06.000> controllable<00:02:06.630> was

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
little bit it's very controllable was

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
little bit it's very controllable was
stupid<00:02:07.890> control<00:02:08.220> you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
stupid control you

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
stupid control you
so<00:02:09.450> here's<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.929> zoom<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so here's the zoom as you can see the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.559 
so here's the zoom as you can see the
rate<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.370> fire<00:02:11.610> changes<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> little<00:02:12.270> bit<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
rate of fire changes a little bit you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
rate of fire changes a little bit you
have<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.720> lot<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:12.989> flashing<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.739> goes

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
have a lot of flashing and that it goes

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
have a lot of flashing and that it goes
into<00:02:14.040> about<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:15.120> bullet<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.540> second<00:02:15.900> all

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
into about one bullet a second all

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.479 
into about one bullet a second all
actually<00:02:16.530> faster<00:02:16.739> than<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.099> but<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.340> can

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
actually faster than that but you can

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.850 
actually faster than that but you can
tell<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> difference<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:19.170> makes<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.680> seem

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
tell the difference it makes it seem

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
tell the difference it makes it seem
like<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.130> useless<00:02:20.489> what<00:02:20.849> not<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> useless<00:02:21.270> weapon

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
like a useless what not a useless weapon

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.059 
like a useless what not a useless weapon
but<00:02:21.810> almost<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.200> ineffective<00:02:22.560> weapon<00:02:23.010> at

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
but almost an ineffective weapon at

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.160 
but almost an ineffective weapon at
times<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.580> get<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:24.000> gun<00:02:24.300> by<00:02:24.480> auto<00:02:24.720> rifle

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
times can you get out gun by auto rifle

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.860 
times can you get out gun by auto rifle
some<00:02:25.319> pvb<00:02:25.769> pretty<00:02:26.340> hard<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.360> once<00:02:27.569> again

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
some pvb pretty hard but the once again

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.509 
some pvb pretty hard but the once again
the<00:02:28.019> damage<00:02:28.349> makes<00:02:28.650> up<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.340> you

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
the damage makes up for it and you

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.030 
the damage makes up for it and you
actually<00:02:29.760> win<00:02:30.150> fights<00:02:30.620> even<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.709> you're<00:02:31.830> down

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
actually win fights even if you're down

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.490 
actually win fights even if you're down
halfway<00:02:32.310> through<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> flight<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.500> reason

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
halfway through the flight the reason

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.110 
halfway through the flight the reason
for<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.739> being<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
for this being is because you have the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.449 
for this being is because you have the
source<00:02:36.450> regime<00:02:36.840> /<00:02:37.140> which<00:02:37.620> basically<00:02:38.130> means

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
source regime / which basically means

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.940 
source regime / which basically means
you<00:02:39.239> know<00:02:39.360> way<00:02:39.690> more<00:02:39.720> damage<00:02:40.260> towards<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.800> end

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you know way more damage towards the end

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740 
you know way more damage towards the end
of<00:02:41.100> your<00:02:41.190> magazine<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.330> you're<00:02:42.480> down<00:02:42.720> in

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
of your magazine and if you're down in

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.870 
of your magazine and if you're down in
the<00:02:42.989> fight<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:44.010> make<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.790> you'll

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
the fight your make up for it and you'll

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.520 
the fight your make up for it and you'll
probably<00:02:45.090> win<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.510> know<00:02:45.690> I've<00:02:45.989> won<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> lot<00:02:46.350> of

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
probably win I know I've won a lot of

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.050 
probably win I know I've won a lot of
gunfights<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.310> thought<00:02:47.489> out<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.910> sure

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
gunfights that I thought out for sure

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.850 
gunfights that I thought out for sure
lose<00:02:48.299> but<00:02:48.739> yeah<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.660> weapon<00:02:52.019> overall<00:02:52.440> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
lose but yeah so the weapon overall I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.670 
lose but yeah so the weapon overall I
don't<00:02:53.100> know<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.190> don't<00:02:53.370> lose<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.819> lot<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.090> games

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
games that I had to do the five for the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.089 
games that I had to do the five for the
crucible<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.540> things<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.890> only
