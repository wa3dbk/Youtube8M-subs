00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello friends how are you here fifa in a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.580
 tutorial in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.830
 something that surely you have already noticed and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.209
 It is that my microphone is heard loud 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 you will have noticed and that is what I am going 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.530
 to teach how to do with your microphone if 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 they have the same problem that I had 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.540
 until now and is that it was heard below 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.220
 well this is very simple the only thing 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.700
 have to do is set up a thing 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.010
 from the microphone menu and now they 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.230
 I'm going to show you how we're going to one of the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 good microphone this serves only 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.519
 for windows 7 well actually I do not know 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.380
 why I did not try the other systems 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.630
 operative are the previous versions 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.329
 and we have to go to the audio icon that 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:50.110
 is the one that upload and download the audio 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.970
 but I did not think so, but right click 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.420
 I have let's open the menu of 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.040
 options in which we have to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 select an option and the option that 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.390
 we are going to select obviously is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.870
 recording devices like the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.990
 microphone hate and we're going to open this menu 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.620
 I do not know if it can be enlarged in which the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.890
 microphone as you see this one is at 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.300
 green is that I listen to my voice then not 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.240
 we have to double click on this 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.290
 to enter what is the menu of the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.810
 microphone 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.700
 and there we are in the microphone either 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.079
 can enlarge good 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.930
 and we're going to see a lot of options 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.180
 general hear levels improvements and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.810
 advanced options what we need 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.540
 to be able to configure is levels 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 and when you enter now you come that 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.610
 this is going to listen down when 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 you enter the first time without having 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.270
 touched I will not be like that like that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.159
 microphone amplification at zero good 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.799
 to be heard well they have to give 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.729
 The microphone amplification walk more 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.670
 10 no more 20 because because if they give to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.140
 more to more 30 each time you will hear 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.840
 too loud and it will rumble 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.229
 too much your voice 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.549
 too much back then leave it at 20 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.549
 they give him to apply 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.860
 apply or it takes the improvement in applying 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 to accept 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.460
 but also accept I suppose and now it 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.620
 he listens to them with clarity and volume his 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.120
 microphone and enough of little signs that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.120
 supposed because below 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.980
 good because now 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.610
 so well I hope you liked it 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.690
 video they comment on that they subscribe 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.080

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.060
 like 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.890
