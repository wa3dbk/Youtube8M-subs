00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.760
 right virtual device mount 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.760
 image and wait another ten seconds 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.259
 continue now 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.330
 ride this under the ace 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.780
 that the first performs the setap 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.459
 downsizing is there now you choose to 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.650
 language you mainly want 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.050
 You'll want English because the other 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.950
 They are shit you do not understand anything not 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.170
 Ok, this is processing the deal here. 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.160
 following acceptance of the terms in the year 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 Following 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.260
 here you put the name you want or 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.010
 leaves the team in general even your 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.010
 computer and gives the following you find 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.989
 the name is to put the mark down and not 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.269
 Following 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.110
 here is where the part of the game will be 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.269
 installed 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.769
 obviously you just could not put the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.670
 yours if you do not want it to be yours 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.840
 cocal status tightens cartoon on 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.330
 day 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:58.510
 there you look for where you want 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.640
 same here because if you 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.340
 want to play radio 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.709
 the game station and radio then if not 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.430
 You want to max osmar then the Colker 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.870
 Following 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.910
 now you are not installing to finish 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.650
 I'll be right back, the crew had a delay. 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.640
 the installation of 15 to 20 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.870
 minutes 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.359
 So it 's good, I came back and now you have 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.420
 that mount according to the right iso if you 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.180
 It gave the ok here will not catch right will ask 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.390
 the second iso and now will change the engine 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.569
 again 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.790
 the right of virtual devices and 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.220
 now you can not mount below 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.580
 other media without the same media in the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.180
 time but can be up to second again 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.180
 next only 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.370
 I was now you ride according to ISO 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.370
 again stable 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:04.140
 set up can now close and gave the ok 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.140
 now it's very fast 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.580
 is for a gameplay of this game too 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.960
 I think I still think that from now on 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.960
 little easy gameplay it 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 you can see the game graphic for 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.470
 pool has improved quite a bit by 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.300
 very much improved because it has 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.840
 two kaka looks like it's a very game 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.840
 ugly 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.430
 I was with a 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.550
 I want you to write on the channel. 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.550
 also said 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.880
 I liked the workout, I like this video. 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.030
 also ready ended here 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:10.510
 Now let's go to what game right enters the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:14.170
 folder was well on crack and gives a 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:18.130
 control if they come computer to put the 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:20.610
 and program files and search 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.610
 rockstar games 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.680
 and then it just does not provide copy here 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.400
 replace will continue 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.400
 yea 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.800
 the last thing the network concern 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.160
 send to work 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.520
 If the game will be here complete already, right? 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.920
 just play will make a game player that is 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.580
 a little of that game for you 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.120
 I promise and this is it for 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.120
