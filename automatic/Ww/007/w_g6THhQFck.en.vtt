it<00:02:18.870> he<00:02:19.050> was<00:02:19.170> probably<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.590> step<00:02:19.890> late<00:02:20.190> when<00:02:20.400> he

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
it he was probably a step late when he

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.000 
it he was probably a step late when he
adjusted<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.959> he<00:02:22.110> still<00:02:22.380> got<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.860> that's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
adjusted but he still got there that's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.350 
adjusted but he still got there that's
what<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.489> do<00:02:23.700> put<00:02:23.910> your<00:02:24.000> foot<00:02:24.239> down

don't fade to it too soon because then

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.960 
don't fade to it too soon because then
you<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.590> give<00:02:50.040> him<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.310> chance<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.730> go

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
you then you give him a chance to go

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.600 
you then you give him a chance to go
with<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.420> wait<00:02:52.319> as<00:02:52.470> long<00:02:52.500> as<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.400> fade

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
with you wait as long as you can to fade

to it and create separation as the ball
arrives

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.500 

now<00:03:13.040> darn<00:03:14.040> Hill<00:03:14.280> captain<00:03:14.760> wasn't<00:03:14.940> flying<00:03:15.270> up

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
now darn Hill captain wasn't flying up

now darn Hill captain wasn't flying up
there<00:03:15.660> I'd<00:03:15.810> probably<00:03:16.050> be<00:03:16.470> able<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.739> do<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
there I'd probably be able to do this a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520 
there I'd probably be able to do this a
lot<00:03:17.400> easier<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:18.030> never<00:03:18.599> fails<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.140> Smurf<00:03:19.380> his

lot easier but never fails to Smurf his
luck<00:03:20.209> anyway<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.390> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> make<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
luck anyway I just want to make a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.750 
luck anyway I just want to make a
coaching<00:03:22.410> point<00:03:22.680> relative<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.220> what<00:03:23.580> he<00:03:23.730> just

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
coaching point relative to what he just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000 
coaching point relative to what he just
did<00:03:24.180> there<00:03:24.480> he<00:03:24.720> let<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:24.959> ball<00:03:25.319> come<00:03:25.590> down<00:03:25.800> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
did there he let that ball come down to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.530 
did there he let that ball come down to
his<00:03:26.130> hip<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:26.580> he<00:03:26.640> knows<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.300> no-no

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
his hip now he knows that's a no-no

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.290 
his hip now he knows that's a no-no
because<00:03:28.110> I've<00:03:28.260> always<00:03:28.650> taught<00:03:29.180> leverage<00:03:30.180> the
