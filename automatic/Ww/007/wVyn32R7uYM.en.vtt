well as it moved behind the star the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.310 
well as it moved behind the star the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
light became less bright in the blue but

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.740 
light became less bright in the blue but
not<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.980> green<00:04:05.220> or<00:04:05.459> red<00:04:05.519> now<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.510> meant

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
not in the green or red now this meant

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.940 
not in the green or red now this meant
that<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> planet<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.350> went<00:04:07.590> behind<00:04:07.709> the

that the planet that went behind the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.160 
that the planet that went behind the
star<00:04:08.220> must<00:04:08.489> be<00:04:08.640> blue<00:04:08.910> because<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> light<00:04:09.840> was

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
star must be blue because the light was

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.320 
star must be blue because the light was

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
when it when it was hidden the planet

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.909 
when it when it was hidden the planet
was<00:04:15.090> contributing<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.720> tiny<00:04:16.080> amount<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.709> blue

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
was contributing a tiny amount of blue

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.770 
was contributing a tiny amount of blue
light<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> star<00:04:17.729> spectrum<00:04:18.269> as<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.570> passed

light to the star spectrum as it passed

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.270 
light to the star spectrum as it passed
in<00:04:18.959> front<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.820> must<00:04:21.090> be<00:04:21.180> blue<00:04:21.770> sea<00:04:22.770> clever

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
in front so it must be blue sea clever

huh now the earth looks blue from space

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.950 
huh now the earth looks blue from space
because<00:04:26.250> oceans<00:04:26.820> absorb<00:04:27.060> red<00:04:27.599> and

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.520 
side of the planet so why is this planet
blue<00:05:26.720> according<00:05:27.720> to<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.930> spectra<00:05:28.259> there<00:05:28.409> are

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
blue according to the spectra there are

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.290 
blue according to the spectra there are
silicate<00:05:29.009> particles<00:05:29.069> laced<00:05:29.729> in<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.090> high

clouds of the atmosphere because the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.310 
clouds of the atmosphere because the
temperature<00:05:32.849> is<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.120> high<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.780> silicate

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
temperature is so high the silicate

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.710 
temperature is so high the silicate
particles<00:05:34.380> could<00:05:35.220> condense<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:36.030> form<00:05:36.090> very

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
particles could condense and form very

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.200 
particles could condense and form very
small<00:05:37.199> drops<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:37.949> they<00:05:38.490> would<00:05:38.639> scatter<00:05:38.940> blue

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
small drops and they would scatter blue

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.930 
small drops and they would scatter blue
light<00:05:39.330> more<00:05:40.199> than<00:05:40.409> red<00:05:40.560> light<00:05:40.770> so<00:05:41.250> let's<00:05:41.759> just

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
light more than red light so let's just

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.070 
light more than red light so let's just

take a minute here and put all this
together<00:05:43.250> here<00:05:44.250> we<00:05:44.400> have<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.610> planet<00:05:45.060> with<00:05:45.180> a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
together here we have a planet with a

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.600 
together here we have a planet with a
daytime<00:05:45.750> temperature<00:05:46.259> of<00:05:46.469> over<00:05:46.800> a<00:05:46.919> thousand
