backing up and make sure you don't bend
the<00:02:01.979> metal<00:02:02.280> part<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.420> I've<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:03.930> end<00:02:04.229> out

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.630 
the metal part so I've got one end out
and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> pull<00:02:05.520> the

and there you have your backing without
the<00:02:13.180> shank<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.430> then<00:02:15.580> you're<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.849> have

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the shank so then you're going to have

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.240 
the shank so then you're going to have
