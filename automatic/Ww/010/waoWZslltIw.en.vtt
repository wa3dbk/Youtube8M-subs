construction yeah and I've got a couple
of<00:00:45.149> NDS<00:00:45.780> boards<00:00:47.270> yeah<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> normal

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
of NDS boards yeah just like a normal

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
of NDS boards yeah just like a normal
string<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> down<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> middle<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.059> they

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
string and down the middle and they

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.439 
string and down the middle and they
feelin<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> same<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.300> know<00:00:54.300> it's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
feelin the same but I just know it's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.910 
feelin the same but I just know it's
just<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.199> carbon<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.680> feels<00:00:57.770> it's<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
just the carbon just feels it's got a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.640 
just the carbon just feels it's got a
different<00:00:59.129> feel<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> doesn't<00:01:00.090> go<00:01:00.239> bad

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.060 

just<00:01:03.310> doesn't<00:01:03.490> feel<00:01:03.700> like<00:01:04.090> a<00:01:04.360> string<00:01:05.110> that's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
just doesn't feel like a string that's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.830 
just doesn't feel like a string that's
what<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.580> used<00:01:06.730> to<00:01:06.850> yeah<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.600> think<00:01:07.720> is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
what you used to yeah I think is

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.149 
what you used to yeah I think is
probably<00:01:08.050> what<00:01:08.170> I'm<00:01:08.260> used<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.530> it

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:27.240 

quicker<00:01:15.790> flex<00:01:23.640> patenting<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:24.820> anyway<00:01:26.250> first

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
quicker flex patenting but anyway first

combo of like like it's got a little bit

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.420 
combo of like like it's got a little bit
of<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.459> old<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:10.060> my<00:02:10.599> 20<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.200> yeah<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.860> a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
of that the old a my 20 in it yeah and a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.759 
of that the old a my 20 in it yeah and a
bit<00:02:13.090> more<00:02:13.120> modernized<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:14.079> it<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.620> your

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
bit more modernized is it is that your

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.830 
bit more modernized is it is that your
idea<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.160> what's<00:02:15.700> my<00:02:15.940> ID<00:02:16.209> really<00:02:16.420> ideal<00:02:16.750> for

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
idea that what's my ID really ideal for

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.110 
idea that what's my ID really ideal for
yeah<00:02:17.349> because<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.220> was<00:02:18.489> halfway<00:02:18.730> between

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
yeah because if it was halfway between

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.039 
yeah because if it was halfway between
am<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:20.609> 2010<00:02:21.609> and<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.819> thruster<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.780> super

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
am a 2010 and a thruster like a super

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.509 
am a 2010 and a thruster like a super
twin<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.739> know<00:02:23.859> the<00:02:24.100> two<00:02:24.280> themes

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
twin that you know the two themes

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.849 
twin that you know the two themes
without<00:02:24.819> more<00:02:25.000> stabilizer<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:26.380> feels<00:02:26.620> like

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
without more stabilizer it feels like

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.290 
without more stabilizer it feels like
you've<00:02:27.040> tamed<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.609> the<00:02:27.760> quirks<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.329> between

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
you've tamed all the quirks of between

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.300 
you've tamed all the quirks of between
as<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.140> quirks<00:02:30.380> thing<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.710> little<00:02:31.010> hard<00:02:31.160> to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
as in the quirks thing a little hard to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.920 
as in the quirks thing a little hard to
ride<00:02:31.490> back<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:32.000> especially<00:02:32.450> with<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.660> first

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
ride back in especially with that first

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.200 
ride back in especially with that first
bottom<00:02:33.290> turn<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.460> little<00:02:34.610> slightly

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
bottom turn and that little slightly

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.570 
bottom turn and that little slightly
feeling<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:35.900> sometimes<00:02:35.960> off<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.680> top<00:02:36.890> so

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
feeling you get sometimes off the top so

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.550 
feeling you get sometimes off the top so
it<00:02:37.670> feels<00:02:37.850> like<00:02:38.000> those<00:02:38.300> quirks<00:02:38.690> are<00:02:38.870> timed<00:02:39.200> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
it feels like those quirks are timed and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.260 
it feels like those quirks are timed and
then<00:02:40.190> when<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.430> ride<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.640> compared<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.240> a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
then when you ride a compared to a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.840 
then when you ride a compared to a
thruster<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.860> sort<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.370> thrust<00:02:43.610> of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
thruster it's got that sort of thrust of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.460 
thruster it's got that sort of thrust of
feel<00:02:44.060> with<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> little<00:02:44.660> stabilizer<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.410> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
feel with a little stabilizer in the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.250 
feel with a little stabilizer in the
tail<00:02:45.710> but<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.940> just<00:02:47.180> feels<00:02:47.660> like<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.170> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
tail but it just feels like it's a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.180 
tail but it just feels like it's a
little<00:02:48.470> loose<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.800> happy<00:02:51.980> unhappy

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
little loose it's like a happy unhappy

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.830 
little loose it's like a happy unhappy
meeting<00:02:52.790> two<00:02:53.390> boys

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
meeting two boys

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
but again that's kind of all I've

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.150 
but again that's kind of all I've
reading<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.300> last<00:02:56.480> five<00:02:56.780> years<00:02:56.900> not<00:02:57.530> like

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
reading for the last five years not like

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.860 
reading for the last five years not like
I<00:02:58.280> jumped<00:02:58.550> back<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.880> twin<00:02:59.120> fin<00:02:59.330> mmm<00:02:59.570> it<00:02:59.750> was

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I jumped back on the twin fin mmm it was

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.960 
I jumped back on the twin fin mmm it was
too<00:03:00.020> loose<00:03:00.230> yeah<00:03:00.560> yeah<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.460> then<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.730> ride<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
too loose yeah yeah and then I ride a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.720 
too loose yeah yeah and then I ride a
thruster<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.690> actually<00:03:03.080> feels<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.800> little

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
thruster and it actually feels a little

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.600 
thruster and it actually feels a little
tight<00:03:05.140> unless<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.320> take<00:03:08.080> that's<00:03:09.080> why<00:03:09.460> so<00:03:10.460> what

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
tight unless you take that's why so what

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.430 
tight unless you take that's why so what
did<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.910> study<00:03:11.150> done<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.690> after<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.320> were

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
did you study done like after you were

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.860 
did you study done like after you were
riding<00:03:12.650> those<00:03:13.640> famous<00:03:14.000> between<00:03:14.390> ease<00:03:14.690> and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
riding those famous between ease and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.450 
riding those famous between ease and
stuff<00:03:15.110> did<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.620> jump<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.130> her

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
stuff did you jump on her

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.010 
stuff did you jump on her
did<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.880> ever<00:03:17.030> go<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.390> other<00:03:17.480> way<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.810> ride

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
did you ever go the other way in ride

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.320 
did you ever go the other way in ride
just<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.500> what<00:03:19.400> did<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.610> always<00:03:19.820> refine

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
just like a what did you always refine

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.440 
just like a what did you always refine
that<00:03:20.600> principle<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.940> slowly<00:03:22.940> move<00:03:23.270> towards

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
that principle and slowly move towards

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.550 
that principle and slowly move towards
this<00:03:23.960> kind<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.350> design

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.040 

Indian<00:03:27.980> festival<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.790> that

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:50.330 

and<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.819> know<00:03:41.410> France<00:03:42.410> -<00:03:42.590> maybe

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.300 

I<00:03:50.370> don't<00:03:50.850> know<00:03:50.910> where<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.150> start<00:03:51.420> with

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
I don't know where to start with

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.100 
I don't know where to start with
basically

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
basically

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.130 
basically
the<00:03:55.470> 20<00:03:55.860> sort<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.250> started<00:03:56.640> in<00:03:56.730> 78<00:03:57.270> I<00:03:57.630> guess

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
the 20 sort of started in 78 I guess

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.950 
the 20 sort of started in 78 I guess
they<00:03:58.320> went<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.650> an<00:03:58.770> 82<00:03:59.450> and<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.600> was<00:04:00.690> sort<00:04:00.930> of

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
they went to an 82 and it was sort of

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.930 
they went to an 82 and it was sort of
three<00:04:01.200> generations<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:02.100> them<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.370> whole<00:04:02.520> idea

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
three generations of them the whole idea

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.890 
three generations of them the whole idea
was<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.750> little<00:04:04.500> fawn<00:04:04.740> or<00:04:05.070> now<00:04:05.870> sort<00:04:06.870> of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
was get a little fawn or now sort of

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.880 
was get a little fawn or now sort of
could<00:04:07.110> hear

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
could hear

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.740 
could hear
and<00:04:09.070> then<00:04:09.310> when<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.610> trust<00:04:09.850> came<00:04:10.150> along<00:04:10.390> sort

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
and then when the trust came along sort

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.420 
and then when the trust came along sort
of<00:04:10.950> relegated<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.160> twins

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
of relegated the twins

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.659 
of relegated the twins
in<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:15.049> same<00:04:15.290> place<00:04:15.560> basically<00:04:15.950> with

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
in the same place basically with

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.729 
in the same place basically with
Stephanie<00:04:17.150> yourself<00:04:17.479> well<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:18.109> kept<00:04:18.530> writing

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
Stephanie yourself well I kept writing

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.189 
Stephanie yourself well I kept writing
them<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.310> problem<00:04:19.759> was<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.299> got<00:04:20.479> pigeon-holed

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
them that problem was I got pigeon-holed

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.490 
them that problem was I got pigeon-holed
as<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:22.400> twin<00:04:22.610> team<00:04:22.820> guy<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.870> was<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.020> thruster

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
as the twin team guy that was a thruster

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.439 
as the twin team guy that was a thruster
generation<00:04:25.130> my<00:04:25.310> guys<00:04:25.580> were<00:04:25.759> coming<00:04:25.910> in<00:04:26.210> going

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
generation my guys were coming in going

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.440 
generation my guys were coming in going
what<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.720> thrusters<00:04:27.199> gotta<00:04:27.410> like

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
what a thrusters gotta like

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.840 
what a thrusters gotta like
my<00:04:28.540> right<00:04:28.990> twin<00:04:29.260> twin<00:04:29.500> sir<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:30.460> know<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.610> just

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
my right twin twin sir you know I just

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.730 
my right twin twin sir you know I just
felt<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.450> was<00:04:31.570> sort<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.840> losing<00:04:32.260> surfboard

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
felt like I was sort of losing surfboard

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.530 
felt like I was sort of losing surfboard
sales<00:04:33.010> because<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.550> was<00:04:33.670> writing<00:04:34.030> about<00:04:34.210> people

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
sales because I was writing about people

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.030 
sales because I was writing about people
why

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
why

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.920 
why
so<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.580> started

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
so I started

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.749 
so I started
you<00:04:38.320> know<00:04:38.410> because<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.949> right<00:04:39.160> trust<00:04:39.580> us

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
you know because of that right trust us

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.520 
you know because of that right trust us
that's<00:04:40.000> probably<00:04:40.270> when<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:40.540> saw<00:04:40.750> me<00:04:40.960> rolling

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
that's probably when you saw me rolling

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.460 
that's probably when you saw me rolling
at<00:04:41.860> Rosco<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.550> then<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.780> sir<00:04:44.050> between

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
at Rosco and then the sir between

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.840 
at Rosco and then the sir between
actually<00:04:44.949> came<00:04:45.220> from

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.330 

so<00:04:48.510> either<00:04:48.660> in<00:04:48.990> Japan<00:04:49.320> are<00:04:49.680> doing<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:49.980> board's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
so either in Japan are doing the board's

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.030 
so either in Japan are doing the board's
on<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:51.030> Japan<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.840> they've<00:04:52.680> been<00:04:52.890> getting

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
on in Japan and they've been getting

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.100 
on in Japan and they've been getting
thrusters<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:53.940> actually<00:04:54.120> ordered<00:04:54.450> some<00:04:54.810> 20

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
thrusters and I actually ordered some 20

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:03.530 
thrusters and I actually ordered some 20
things<00:04:55.290> for<00:04:55.470> some<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.710> their<00:04:55.830> $10<00:05:02.330> I'll<00:05:03.330> try

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
things for some of their $10 I'll try

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.930 
things for some of their $10 I'll try
and<00:05:03.690> make<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.960> board<00:05:04.170> halfway<00:05:04.650> between<00:05:04.940> the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
and make the board halfway between the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.940 
and make the board halfway between the
retro<00:05:06.300> twins<00:05:06.660> like<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> old<00:05:07.200> twin<00:05:07.440> fin<00:05:07.710> tire

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
retro twins like the old twin fin tire

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.430 
retro twins like the old twin fin tire
which<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.970> know<00:05:09.090> thruster<00:05:09.540> curves<00:05:09.930> just<00:05:10.230> make

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
which you know thruster curves just make

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:20.920 
which you know thruster curves just make
me<00:05:10.920> wider<00:05:12.440> like<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.540> this

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.340 

some<00:05:21.620> books<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:22.370> actually<00:05:23.300> sent<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.930> first

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
some books and actually sent the first

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.700 
some books and actually sent the first
