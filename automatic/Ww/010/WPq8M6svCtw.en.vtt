00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.800
 no no 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.360
 hello to all and the sport I hope that 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.010
 you are fine 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.360
 so today a second episode of 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.900
 the tree analysis series 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.520
 exotic 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.230
 so the purpose I remind you of you 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.820
 offer an analysis on tears in you 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.290
 presenting the positive points and 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.939
 negative points for those for example 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.160
 who would exist to buy tears at 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.809
 measure when it is available or 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.550
 again from the rise to the maximum after 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.800
 have tasted it rather than another weapon 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.270
 and finally of course whether it is worth 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.550
 worth taking your unique 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.040
 location in exotic in your 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.840
 this second video equipment 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.490
 will present the gala wave that is 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.800
 so this query with solar damage 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.200
 with two cartridges per chargers and 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.329
 five cartridges at most so very 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 known to be one or even tears the 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.680
 more powerful of the game but also for 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.510
 his design and his name enough 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.380
 mythological 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 you can get this weapon 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.760
 when it is for sale appear for 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.950
 17 strange piece or decrypting g 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.590
 legendary in the late crip that in the 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.670
 pvp winner to the test your TVs have 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.979
 black night at the raid 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.530
 personally I got it in the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.990
 3rd step of the raid of crop heap against the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.219
 priestesses the most points 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.479
 interesting of this weapon are without 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.670
 no doubt the two options she 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.899
 proposes first in guiding who like 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.090
 his name indicates it allows him to take 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.560
 put to the enemy and to follow him even 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.810
 if it moves after you have 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.819
 then shoot secondly hunt in 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.979
 date is an option that releases mini 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.630
 rockets with searching heads after 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.709
 the impact of the rocket allowing it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.859
 to have a capacity for destruction 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:36.289
 really colossal it's simple in pve 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.539
 pvp very very few enemies can 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.100
 resist such power then not 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.079
 of waste the half dozen mini 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.909
 roccat will allow you to touch 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.639
 to kill all the enemies that lies 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.079
 around a negative point we can 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.670
 doubt his laughter of explosions that remains 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.439
 relatively small compared to others 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.880
 rocket launchers and the lack of options 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.170
 to improve and personalize these 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.389
 different points such as the zoom 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.219
 as could have the truth or the 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.859
 dragon's breath are points that 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.539
 which remains significant to choose 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.880
 your favorite exotic rocket launcher 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.529
 and we make a very annoying point and that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.390
 you do not always control 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:09.649
 the appearance of mini rockets sometimes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 they just do not appear 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.660
 which for the moment makes him lose 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.519
 tremendous impact point who is who 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.250
 can be especially as the gene being 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.150
 given the little ammunition of weapons 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.830
 two available in the game in which 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.450
 regards the visual so this weapon all 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.130
 simply a true work of art 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.960
 there are some loud heads would have a little 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.910
 everywhere on tears of water super notebook 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.420
 saw it also very simple but 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.430
 stylish 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.500
 I really like I have not seen much 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.160
 of weapons as much with so much work 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.600
 on on destiny and it's a pleasure 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.680
 and finally to conclude I think that 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.240
 this weapon is just one of 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.830
 best of destiny and that well 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.080
 obviously it is a little useless without 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.080
 following equipment is a weapon of 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.370
 situation in fact it must be taken out 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.260
 when necessary I think for example 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.660
 against bosses especially against crotta 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.330
 it's I think tears he hates the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.040
 more must still note its lack 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.140
 significant of options and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
 customization and make my advice 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.800
 since you will not use this weapon 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.230
 for most meetings 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.420
 use your exotic main or 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.610
 special is passed to this weapon 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.610
 when the time is right and when you 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.480
 have ammunition of heavy weapons 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.190
 and here is the video is now 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.550
 do not hesitate to give me back on 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.620
 the video I tell you very quickly to 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.130
 an upcoming video on destiny go 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.130
 hi has more
