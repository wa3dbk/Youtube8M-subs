 question 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.950
 then too lord jesus christ 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.359
 lung than nuts 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.169
 and at the first regiment emil hegle 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:16.849
 without chion 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.849
 sailors so here is the earlier the bacteria 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.119
 plus fly here than the sea 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.239
 6 42 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.369
 they are sitting injury 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.289
 we call our Orthodox Church 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.430
 our prayers of caviar to one god 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.000
 spouse father occasion first sample of the saint 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 to the spirit 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040
 obviously these two concepts are none and that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.840
 same 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 everything is not bad or just 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.030
 right share 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.030
 nato workers pray 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.979
 any 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.760
 any work from the gospel 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 taken 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.650
 separate from all scripture 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.150
 he can't 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.290
 that is useful 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.870
 perplexity 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.980
 All in the first place, respectively, she 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.010
 can't get anything 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.480
 where did you learn what 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.300
 so the doctrine of the holy trinity 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.730
 although such are the words of the sacred community 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.740
 Holy Trinity 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 she's out of getting the gospel 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.340
 father and son and holy spirit 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.860
 called trinity 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 called called church 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.400
 and in this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 no at all confusing norms 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.470
 new besides what is ours 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.310
 there are others in general 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.400
 the police 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.770
 for example maybe you heard prayed 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460
 Kapustin Virgin Mary Rejoice 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.460
 about how to pray the virgin 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.120
 eg 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.660
 throne with 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.680
 didn't teach 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 but the books themselves turned 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 and therefore it can be said that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.909
 he was quick with his actions 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.870
 then there is such a thing in the light 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.379
 of which we can only 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.189
 understand the scriptures 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.599
 this 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.219
 give holy 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.429
 because 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.269
 the most sacred scripture 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.869
 it's just 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.689
 recorded part transferred 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.639
 a lot of note name 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.969
 levi if everything is recorded and the whole world 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.399
 not fit 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 m is written then 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.109
 therefore there is all church tradition 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.359
 the church itself is the guardian of truth 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.419
 and including 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.549
 and devoted th 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.719
 which created the church for 2,000 years and 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.359
 continues to create 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.429
 earlier 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.429
 has 150 ti volumes 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:09.329
 and now here is a new service we are creating 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.889
 nkre again orthodox saints 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.929
 there is nothing 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.759
 such a 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.049
 not involved 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.529
 low 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:26.199
 and there is nothing in it that changes 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.289
 in pakistan exercises 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.219
 whom he heard the question 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.219
 because christ laid only sitting 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.139
 Azarenko for 2000 years this system has grown 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.739
 in huge 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.739
 and beautiful day 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:47.619
 problem if therefore your 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.099
 but so 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.099
 the subject 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.589
 to bring 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.509
 there is only in mathematics 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.139
 spouse bus splitting task 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.999
 to the point of absurdity 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.849
 that is, then we need it all 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.819
 close all are equal 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.189
 gather only for prayer 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.189
 percentage only at night 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.260
 nn here are some of such household 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.489
 conditions 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.369
 moreover, we must comply with all 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.469
 Jewish holidays 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.459
 we have to do this trim 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.490
 but and so on then 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.460
 and what's stopping anyone 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.499
 Begin with yourself 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.169
 here and I suggest you create an edge 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.389
 easy way 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.169
 rolled made 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.969
 percentage so to speak 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:35.800
 by giving 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.840
 everyone to understand that he came not to break 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.180
 republic laws 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.610
 then here we are here you need 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.199
 then everything will turn out to be 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.550
 consistent 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.210
 and all prescriptions 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.830
 which are present for Ukraine to eat 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.110
 pork there 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.830
 together with still not connected 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.569
 battle so on 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.539
 a year let's go like this 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.129
 because that tradition kiyu disks 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.120
 in which the press factory and the action 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 she stayed on speeches 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.449
 can go further 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.199
 christ said if the right eye is special 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.210
 noted in berlin 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.189
 so it will happen to you 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.870
 let's 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.259
 and reports ap 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.680
 if the remaining two seduce dug 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.259
 Kiev 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.879
 they also sacrifice their hands first 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.599
 all these goals above any freedom and then 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.909
 the rights 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.669
 well then 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.169
 here we will 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.800
 work felt boots to follow seemed 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.520
 one more 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.289
 here was such a case 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.419
 the collective church teacher 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.349
 no interlocking holy cause 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.120
 he castrated himself 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.050
 because in the gospel read what 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.280
 if people melt wider themselves 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.309
 for the kingdom's sake but how was it destined 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:56.939
 these self-harm 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.999
 it leads away from the holy 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.360
 participles 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360
 because he took it literally 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.169
 so that 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.280
 steam rooms 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.280
 unfortunately in them the tradition of the church 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.249
 perceived 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:16.979
 here's what 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.979
 the market is criminal persons sacred thousand 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.710
 that's all 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.139
 it is very roof sad but on the other 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.330
 there is nothing wrong with the terrible thing either 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.689
 because it is 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.839
 in this error if I'm sorry this is a legend 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:33.900
 then as a gift 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.159
 well, that is not scary for you 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:39.169
 I hope you will not want at all 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.939
 I hope you will not reach for his hands 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:46.150
 and also with everything else why
