00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
lynly to lengthen her top leg out

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.419 
lynly to lengthen her top leg out
pressing<00:00:29.659> that<00:00:29.779> top<00:00:30.050> foot<00:00:30.319> down<00:00:30.589> away<00:00:31.009> and

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
pressing that top foot down away and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.270 
pressing that top foot down away and
then<00:00:32.180> roll<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.719> ball<00:00:32.930> up<00:00:33.109> along<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:33.859> inside

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
then roll the ball up along the inside

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.639

of the ankle before pressing down again

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.709 
of the ankle before pressing down again
this<00:00:39.649> facilitates<00:00:40.370> lumbar<00:00:40.969> lateral<00:00:41.300> flexion

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
this facilitates lumbar lateral flexion

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.060 
this facilitates lumbar lateral flexion
and<00:00:43.660> again<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:44.809> very<00:00:44.870> useful<00:00:45.469> for<00:00:45.500> clients

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
and again it's very useful for clients

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.310 
and again it's very useful for clients

who have had sacroiliac joint issues to

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.590 
who have had sacroiliac joint issues to
learn<00:00:48.530> how<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:48.800> control<00:00:49.399> one<00:00:49.730> ilium<00:00:50.179> in

now as one progression of this exercise

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.690 
now as one progression of this exercise
I<00:02:01.509> may<00:02:01.780> ask<00:02:01.929> Lindley<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.619> lift<00:02:02.829> both<00:02:03.039> legs<00:02:03.100> up

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
I may ask Lindley to lift both legs up

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.969 
I may ask Lindley to lift both legs up
off<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.090> ground<00:02:04.359> just<00:02:04.689> hover<00:02:05.409> them<00:02:05.619> slightly

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
off the ground just hover them slightly

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.630 
off the ground just hover them slightly
and<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> very<00:02:07.840> small<00:02:08.349> movement<00:02:08.709> roll

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
and then with a very small movement roll

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.850 
and then with a very small movement roll
the<00:02:09.819> ball<00:02:10.030> forward<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.629> back<00:02:10.869> with<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> small

and<00:02:12.160> slow<00:02:12.550> kicking<00:02:13.090> action<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.629> feet

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.900 

again<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.530> facilitates<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> core<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
again this facilitates the core and the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.490 
again this facilitates the core and the
glue<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.209> your<00:02:19.330> muscles<00:02:19.720> quite<00:02:19.930> nicely<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:22.500> it

glue to your muscles quite nicely and it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.009 
glue to your muscles quite nicely and it
allows<00:02:23.799> your<00:02:24.099> client<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.700> start<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.150> work<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.780> a
