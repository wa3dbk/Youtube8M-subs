00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
alright so we're gonna start off with a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.750 
alright so we're gonna start off with a
very<00:00:33.410> commonly<00:00:34.410> used<00:00:34.530> smoke<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.250> hold<00:00:35.460> middle

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
very commonly used smoke to hold middle

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760 
very commonly used smoke to hold middle
I<00:00:35.850> use<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.420> especially<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.930> save<00:00:37.260> rounds

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I use it a lot especially on save rounds

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.209 
I use it a lot especially on save rounds
what<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.850> smoke<00:00:39.149> does<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.590> allows<00:00:40.829> me<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
what this smoke does is it allows me to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
what this smoke does is it allows me to
smoke<00:00:41.670> middle<00:00:42.090> especially<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> update

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
smoke middle especially with the update

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.389 
smoke middle especially with the update
to<00:00:43.230> source<00:00:43.469> where<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:43.950> no<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.280> way

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
to source where there's no one way

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.500 
to source where there's no one way
smokes<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:44.879> can't<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.270> through<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
smokes and they can't see through it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
smokes and they can't see through it
properly<00:00:45.840> smoke<00:00:46.500> middle<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> middle

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
properly smoke middle so that middle

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.880

cannot<00:00:47.789> watch<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.390> lower<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.320> when<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> player

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
cannot watch the lower so when a player

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
cannot watch the lower so when a player
comes<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.489> lower<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.850> flash<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.390> nade<00:00:51.570> Kat<00:00:51.840> I

make<00:01:53.599> holding<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.049> edge<00:01:54.140> harm<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:55.610> next

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
make holding the edge harm this next

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.240 
make holding the edge harm this next
smoke<00:01:56.209> is<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.599> that<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.259> cuts<00:01:57.500> off<00:01:57.709> the<00:01:57.860> vision

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
smoke is so that it cuts off the vision

of the CT on Kat and the vision of the
CT<00:02:01.069> and<00:02:01.250> middle<00:02:01.579> so<00:02:01.759> basically<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.360> do<00:02:02.479> is

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
CT and middle so basically what to do is

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.699 
CT and middle so basically what to do is
