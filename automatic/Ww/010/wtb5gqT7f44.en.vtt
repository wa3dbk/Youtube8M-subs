this customer brought them in to get a
crotch<00:00:20.329> repair<00:00:20.689> this<00:00:21.289> isn't<00:00:21.589> the<00:00:21.650> worst<00:00:21.829> that

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
crotch repair this isn't the worst that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.249 
crotch repair this isn't the worst that
we've<00:00:22.099> seen<00:00:22.369> but<00:00:22.519> it's<00:00:22.699> a<00:00:22.789> fairly<00:00:23.509> significant

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
we've seen but it's a fairly significant

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.929 
we've seen but it's a fairly significant
it<00:00:24.560> looks<00:00:24.739> like<00:00:24.859> he<00:00:24.949> did<00:00:25.099> some<00:00:25.279> home<00:00:25.609> repairs

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
it looks like he did some home repairs

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.970 
it looks like he did some home repairs
to<00:00:26.089> it<00:00:26.119> which<00:00:26.269> is<00:00:26.419> cool<00:00:26.599> but<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.349> did<00:00:27.529> start<00:00:27.829> to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
to it which is cool but it did start to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.669 
to it which is cool but it did start to
fall<00:00:28.220> apart<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:28.909> it's<00:00:29.479> important<00:00:29.929> to<00:00:30.109> look<00:00:30.499> at

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
fall apart so it's important to look at

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.589 
fall apart so it's important to look at
the<00:00:30.859> wear<00:00:31.009> pattern<00:00:31.399> of<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:31.579> jeans<00:00:31.819> and<00:00:32.029> if<00:00:32.449> you

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
the wear pattern of the jeans and if you

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.020 
the wear pattern of the jeans and if you
darn<00:00:32.840> something<00:00:33.140> up<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.469> you<00:00:33.559> don't<00:00:34.030> properly

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
darn something up and you don't properly

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.610 
darn something up and you don't properly
secure<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.629> stress<00:00:35.840> points<00:00:36.109> change<00:00:36.350> a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
secure it the stress points change a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.310 
secure it the stress points change a
good<00:00:36.890> way<00:00:37.039> for<00:00:37.070> me<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.370> check<00:00:37.699> them<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:39.140> hold

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
good way for me to check them is to hold

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.020 
good way for me to check them is to hold
them<00:00:39.440> up<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:39.590> light<00:00:39.890> a<00:00:40.129> couple<00:00:40.550> things<00:00:40.850> we<00:00:41.000> need

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
them up to light a couple things we need

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.349 
them up to light a couple things we need
to<00:00:41.239> do<00:00:41.420> before<00:00:41.989> we<00:00:42.019> get<00:00:42.230> started<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:43.359> mentioned

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
to do before we get started I mentioned

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.970 
to do before we get started I mentioned
before<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.629> there<00:00:44.839> was<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.989> home<00:00:45.469> repair<00:00:45.620> done

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
before that there was a home repair done

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.889 
before that there was a home repair done
here<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:46.760> what<00:00:46.910> we<00:00:47.000> want<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.300> do<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.539> we<00:00:47.660> want<00:00:47.839> to

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
here so what we want to do is we want to

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.110 
here so what we want to do is we want to
actually<00:00:48.019> take<00:00:48.379> these<00:00:48.559> threads<00:00:48.890> out<00:00:49.120> when

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
actually take these threads out when

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.250 
actually take these threads out when
we're<00:00:50.239> darning<00:00:50.570> we<00:00:50.660> don't<00:00:50.809> want<00:00:50.929> them<00:00:51.019> to<00:00:51.140> be

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
we're darning we don't want them to be

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.959 
we're darning we don't want them to be
in<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.440> way<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:51.739> honestly<00:00:52.519> it<00:00:52.609> might<00:00:52.760> look<00:00:52.879> a

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
in the way and honestly it might look a

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.849 
in the way and honestly it might look a
little<00:00:52.999> unattractive<00:00:53.719> if<00:00:53.839> the<00:00:54.079> thread<00:00:54.589> colors

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
little unattractive if the thread colors

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.650 
little unattractive if the thread colors
are<00:00:54.980> kind<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:55.160> popping<00:00:55.370> through<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.850> darn<00:00:56.059> so

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
are kind of popping through the darn so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.889 
are kind of popping through the darn so
what<00:00:57.469> we're<00:00:57.620> going<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.769> do<00:00:58.039> is<00:00:58.449> trim<00:00:59.449> a<00:00:59.510> lot<00:00:59.719> of

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
what we're going to do is trim a lot of

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.989 
what we're going to do is trim a lot of
these<00:00:59.960> edges<00:01:00.440> off<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.920> we'll<00:01:01.489> have<00:01:01.609> a<00:01:01.670> clean

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
these edges off and we'll have a clean

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.200 
these edges off and we'll have a clean
area<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.690> work<00:01:02.809> with

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
here we're going to work our way this

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.160 
here we're going to work our way this

process if anything's wrong you can kind

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.250 
process if anything's wrong you can kind
of<00:01:35.090> cut<00:01:35.270> these<00:01:35.450> threads<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.900> start<00:01:36.140> over

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
and we're going to start building

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.350 
and we're going to start building
threads<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:58.190> way<00:02:01.060> whereas<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.240> would

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
threads this way whereas you would

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.090 
threads this way whereas you would
usually<00:02:02.510> have<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> patch<00:02:02.990> back<00:02:03.230> here<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.950> is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
usually have a patch back here this is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.470 
usually have a patch back here this is
all<00:02:04.190> just<00:02:04.340> new<00:02:04.520> fabric<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:04.970> getting<00:02:05.210> woven

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
all just new fabric that's getting woven

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600 
all just new fabric that's getting woven
in<00:02:05.600> we're<00:02:06.230> going<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.410> sew<00:02:06.590> into<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.010> edges<00:02:07.430> and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
in we're going to sew into the edges and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.130 
in we're going to sew into the edges and
really<00:02:08.060> make<00:02:08.210> sure<00:02:08.240> that<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.600> locks<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:09.020> with

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
really make sure that it locks in with

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.810 
really make sure that it locks in with
the<00:02:09.229> existing<00:02:09.290> denim<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.100> don't<00:02:10.280> do<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.610> it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
the existing denim you don't do that it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.940 
the existing denim you don't do that it
will<00:02:11.060> start<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.450> fall<00:02:11.630> apart<00:02:11.840> over<00:02:11.930> time<00:02:12.200> pay

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
will start to fall apart over time pay

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.320 
will start to fall apart over time pay
attention<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> way<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.030> denim

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
attention to the way that the denim

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.729 
attention to the way that the denim
fades<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.930> as<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.260> see<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.530> vertical

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
fades and as you can see the vertical

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.800 
fades and as you can see the vertical
streaking<00:02:16.340> goes<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.670> way<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.570> when<00:02:17.720> we

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
streaking goes this way so when we

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.850 
streaking goes this way so when we
finish<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.260> want<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.530> go<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.800> direction

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
finish we want to go in that direction

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910 
finish we want to go in that direction
so<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.790> doesn't<00:02:20.090> stand<00:02:20.450> out<00:02:20.570> as<00:02:20.690> much<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so that it doesn't stand out as much the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.500 
so that it doesn't stand out as much the
speed<00:02:22.250> at<00:02:22.400> which<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.670> move<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.970> fabric<00:02:23.150> wall

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
speed at which you move the fabric wall

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.540 
speed at which you move the fabric wall
affect<00:02:24.110> how<00:02:24.230> tight<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.040> stitch<00:02:25.250> ends<00:02:25.430> up

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
affect how tight the the stitch ends up

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.490 
affect how tight the the stitch ends up
being

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 

this<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.160> where<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.430> hole<00:02:30.610> was<00:02:30.640> up<00:02:31.360> here<00:02:31.690> is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
this is where the hole was up here is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.210 
this is where the hole was up here is
where<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.230> reinforced<00:02:32.710> them<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.070> actual

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
where we reinforced them to the actual

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.040 
where we reinforced them to the actual
denim<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.880> down<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.540> could<00:02:34.750> probably

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
denim and down here I could probably

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.810 
denim and down here I could probably
extend<00:02:35.380> down<00:02:35.530> here<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> little<00:02:35.950> bit<00:02:36.160> more<00:02:38.670> okay

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
extend down here a little bit more okay

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.430 
extend down here a little bit more okay
we're<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.060> done<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.690> already<00:02:40.870> saw<00:02:41.140> this

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
we're all done you already saw this

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.940 
we're all done you already saw this
major<00:02:42.430> hole<00:02:42.760> repair<00:02:43.210> over<00:02:43.420> here<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:44.650> also<00:02:44.800> took

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
major hole repair over here we also took

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.220 
major hole repair over here we also took
care<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.730> hole<00:02:45.940> right<00:02:46.180> here<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.080> was<00:02:47.170> a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
care of this hole right here it was a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.370 
care of this hole right here it was a
smaller<00:02:47.560> one<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:48.330> right<00:02:49.330> here<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
smaller one and right here was the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.200 
smaller one and right here was the
fabric<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.920> was<00:02:51.070> wearing<00:02:51.370> thin<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:51.940> we

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
fabric that was wearing thin but we

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.230 
fabric that was wearing thin but we
wanted<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.570> reinforce<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.470> as<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.910> on

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
wanted to reinforce it as you can see on

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.850 
wanted to reinforce it as you can see on
a<00:02:55.300> big<00:02:55.570> hole<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:55.900> this<00:02:55.930> there's<00:02:56.350> really<00:02:56.410> no

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
a big hole like this there's really no

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.980 
a big hole like this there's really no
avoiding<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.640> fact<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:58.690> going<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.870> be

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
avoiding the fact that it's going to be

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.740 
avoiding the fact that it's going to be
visible<00:02:59.290> but<00:03:00.010> over<00:03:00.460> time<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:01.360> color<00:03:01.600> will

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
visible but over time this color will

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.970 
visible but over time this color will
kind<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.930> wear<00:03:02.080> off<00:03:02.260> along<00:03:02.500> with<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.740> Jean<00:03:02.950> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
kind of wear off along with the Jean and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.230 
kind of wear off along with the Jean and
it'll<00:03:03.310> blend<00:03:03.490> in<00:03:03.670> nicely

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
it'll blend in nicely

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.180 
it'll blend in nicely
you're<00:03:04.900> darn<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.440> going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> keep<00:03:06.040> on

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you're darn is just going to keep on

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.580 
you're darn is just going to keep on

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
starting to develop allowing us to not

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.710 
starting to develop allowing us to not
only<00:03:21.010> get<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.820> whole<00:03:22.030> darn<00:03:22.270> but<00:03:22.420> also

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
only get that whole darn but also

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.690 
only get that whole darn but also
reinforcing<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.500> sides<00:03:23.710> around<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.220> will

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
reinforcing the sides around it will

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.130 
reinforcing the sides around it will
make<00:03:24.910> sure<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.120> your<00:03:25.360> jeans<00:03:25.570> will<00:03:25.720> last<00:03:25.900> a

lot<00:03:26.290> longer<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.890> we<00:03:27.520> always<00:03:27.640> say<00:03:27.880> earlier<00:03:28.600> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
lot longer so we always say earlier the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860 
lot longer so we always say earlier the
better<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.140> we'll<00:03:29.950> take<00:03:30.100> good<00:03:30.190> care<00:03:30.250> of

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
