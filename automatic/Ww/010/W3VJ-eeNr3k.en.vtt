00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
doesn't sound great but it's better than

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.410

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
to be flat there are a couple places

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.530 
to be flat there are a couple places
where<00:01:13.720> I<00:01:14.310> wear<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> pad<00:01:15.670> seating<00:01:16.150> wasn't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
where I wear the pad seating wasn't

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.210 
where I wear the pad seating wasn't
really<00:01:16.780> good<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.350> just<00:01:17.680> kind<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:17.950> put<00:01:18.190> a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
really good so I just kind of put a

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.880 
really good so I just kind of put a
bunch<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.729> tape<00:01:18.970> over<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.450> hole<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.899> those

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
bunch of tape over the hole and those

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.730 
bunch of tape over the hole and those
two<00:01:21.820> or<00:01:22.149> those<00:01:22.299> three<00:01:22.570> places<00:01:22.810> are<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
two or those three places are on the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.880 
two or those three places are on the
trill<00:01:24.040> keys<00:01:24.340> which<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:25.540> never<00:01:25.899> ever<00:01:26.350> ever

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
trill keys which you never ever ever

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.570 
trill keys which you never ever ever
ever<00:01:27.630> use<00:01:28.630> so<00:01:29.409> literally<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.920> trill<00:01:30.159> keys<00:01:30.369> are

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
ever use so literally the trill keys are

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.240 
ever use so literally the trill keys are
just<00:01:30.789> useless<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:32.470> know<00:01:32.680> actually<00:01:33.070> for

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
just useless and you know actually for

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.310 
just useless and you know actually for
most<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.580> my<00:01:33.640> other<00:01:33.759> clarinets<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:35.110> taped

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
most of my other clarinets I just taped

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.139 
most of my other clarinets I just taped
those<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.800> anyways<00:01:36.250> even<00:01:36.550> if<00:01:36.820> there's<00:01:37.030> no

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
those up anyways even if there's no

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.809 
those up anyways even if there's no
issue<00:01:37.300> because<00:01:37.979> they're<00:01:38.979> just<00:01:39.159> pointless<00:01:39.580> and

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
issue because they're just pointless and

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.660 
issue because they're just pointless and
it's<00:01:40.659> easier<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.679> tape<00:01:41.890> up<00:01:42.069> the<00:01:42.190> trill<00:01:42.429> keys

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
it's easier to tape up the trill keys

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.370 
it's easier to tape up the trill keys
and<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:42.970> leave<00:01:43.149> them<00:01:43.300> open<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.899> know<00:01:44.020> for

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
and to leave them open you know for

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.249 
and to leave them open you know for
damage<00:01:45.250> or<00:01:45.369> whatever<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:46.450> taped<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.140> the

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
damage or whatever so I taped up to the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.749 
damage or whatever so I taped up to the
trophies<00:01:47.679> and<00:01:47.920> for<00:01:48.130> some<00:01:48.250> reason<00:01:48.520> there's<00:01:48.670> a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
trophies and for some reason there's a

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.090 
trophies and for some reason there's a
hole<00:01:48.940> behind<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.929> some<00:01:50.110> key<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.649> taped<00:01:50.920> up
