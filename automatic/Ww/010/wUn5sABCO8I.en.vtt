00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
so what I've managed to make here is a

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.150 
so what I've managed to make here is a
modification<00:00:09.309> board<00:00:09.940> for<00:00:10.570> our<00:00:10.619> standard<00:00:11.619> rock

three switches here for power this one

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.120 
three switches here for power this one
is<00:00:25.390> kind<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:25.780> bypass<00:00:26.260> mode<00:00:26.560> for<00:00:26.800> one<00:00:26.920> I<00:00:26.950> have

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
is kind of a bypass mode for one I have

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.380 
is kind of a bypass mode for one I have
the<00:00:27.250> power<00:00:27.430> off<00:00:27.670> what<00:00:27.880> if<00:00:27.940> I<00:00:28.030> don't<00:00:28.210> want<00:00:28.330> to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
the power off what if I don't want to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.510 
the power off what if I don't want to
use<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.630> board<00:00:28.870> and<00:00:29.200> this<00:00:29.650> one<00:00:29.920> switches<00:00:30.369> it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
use the board and this one switches it

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.429 
use the board and this one switches it
back<00:00:30.700> and<00:00:30.910> forth<00:00:31.150> between<00:00:31.390> what<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:31.900> call<00:00:31.960> drum

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
back and forth between what I call drum

my biggest issue with rock band is that

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.830 
my biggest issue with rock band is that
you've<00:00:47.860> never<00:00:48.040> really<00:00:48.370> been<00:00:48.610> able<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.970> do<00:00:49.480> a

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
you've never really been able to do a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.600 
you've never really been able to do a
double<00:00:50.140> drum<00:00:50.680> or<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:52.980> closed<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.070> open<00:00:54.399> hi-hat

on<00:00:59.500> one<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.160> rock<00:01:00.340> band<00:01:00.550> forum<00:01:00.969> posts<00:01:01.390> I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
on one of the rock band forum posts I

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.810 
on one of the rock band forum posts I
found<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.809> really<00:01:02.050> good<00:01:02.410> circuit<00:01:03.370> for<00:01:03.520> doing<00:01:03.730> a

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
found a really good circuit for doing a

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.369 
found a really good circuit for doing a
drum<00:01:04.000> ball<00:01:04.119> double<00:01:04.540> drum<00:01:04.719> pedal<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.290> I've

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
drum ball double drum pedal and I've

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.639 
drum ball double drum pedal and I've
incorporated<00:01:05.829> that<00:01:06.430> here<00:01:07.270> into<00:01:07.509> my<00:01:07.659> board<00:01:07.959> but

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
incorporated that here into my board but

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.550 
incorporated that here into my board but
what<00:01:08.799> else<00:01:09.249> oh<00:01:09.639> man<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.969> to<00:01:10.090> do<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.509> work<00:01:11.289> on<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
what else oh man is to do is work on the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.859 
what else oh man is to do is work on the
second<00:01:11.979> logic<00:01:12.280> board<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.700> kind<00:01:12.999> of<00:01:13.149> work<00:01:13.719> with

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
second logic board to kind of work with

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.800 
second logic board to kind of work with
the<00:01:13.990> second<00:01:14.380> drum<00:01:14.590> pedal<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.999> blue<00:01:16.479> and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the second drum pedal and the blue and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.059 
the second drum pedal and the blue and
yellow<00:01:17.049> cymbals<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:19.179> I<00:01:19.479> can<00:01:20.289> change<00:01:20.859> the

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
yellow cymbals so that I can change the

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.789 
yellow cymbals so that I can change the
output<00:01:21.219> depending<00:01:21.909> on<00:01:21.939> whether<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.560> drum

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
output depending on whether the drum

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.160 
output depending on whether the drum
pedal<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.249> up<00:01:24.429> or<00:01:24.609> down<00:01:24.639> and<00:01:25.119> which<00:01:25.689> cymbal<00:01:26.049> I'm

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
pedal is up or down and which cymbal I'm

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.399 
pedal is up or down and which cymbal I'm
hitting<00:01:26.469> and<00:01:27.179> I<00:01:28.179> think<00:01:28.779> it<00:01:28.869> works<00:01:29.049> better<00:01:29.289> if

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
hitting and I think it works better if

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.739 
hitting and I think it works better if
it<00:01:29.679> speak<00:01:29.889> for<00:01:29.920> itself<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.420> it's<00:01:32.259> time<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.469> show

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
it speak for itself so it's time to show

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.779 
it speak for itself so it's time to show
okay<00:01:34.749> so<00:01:35.380> like<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.679> said<00:01:35.740> before<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.729> a

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
okay so like I said before I have a

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.429 
okay so like I said before I have a
basic<00:01:37.119> bypass<00:01:37.599> mode<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.020> that's<00:01:38.139> what<00:01:38.319> it's

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
basic bypass mode and that's what it's

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.440 
basic bypass mode and that's what it's
in<00:01:38.590> now<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.279> battery<00:01:39.549> pack<00:01:39.789> is<00:01:39.969> completely

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
in now the battery pack is completely

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.089 
in now the battery pack is completely
off<00:01:40.599> you<00:01:40.779> can<00:01:40.899> see<00:01:41.049> I<00:01:41.079> can<00:01:41.289> still<00:01:41.619> hit<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
off you can see I can still hit the

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.219 
off you can see I can still hit the
single<00:01:42.369> drum<00:01:42.670> pedal<00:01:42.999> the<00:01:43.539> left<00:01:43.749> drum<00:01:43.959> pedal

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
single drum pedal the left drum pedal

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.609 
single drum pedal the left drum pedal
there's<00:01:44.409> nothing<00:01:45.389> all<00:01:46.389> the<00:01:46.810> cymbals<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.469> the

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
there's nothing all the cymbals and the

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.819 
there's nothing all the cymbals and the
drum<00:01:48.159> kits<00:01:48.810> work<00:01:49.810> on<00:01:49.990> their<00:01:50.139> own<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:50.560> what<00:01:50.709> I'm

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
drum kits work on their own so what I'm

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.440 
drum kits work on their own so what I'm
going<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.009> do<00:01:51.159> now<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.669> I'm<00:01:51.880> going<00:01:52.029> to<00:01:52.090> turn<00:01:52.270> it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
going to do now is I'm going to turn it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.809 
going to do now is I'm going to turn it
on<00:01:52.599> and<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:57.159> going<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.340> switch<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.700> into

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
on and I'm going to switch it into

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.940 
on and I'm going to switch it into
double<00:01:58.389> drum<00:01:58.749> pedal<00:01:59.049> mode<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.499> you<00:01:59.590> can<00:01:59.739> see

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
double drum pedal mode so you can see

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.419
