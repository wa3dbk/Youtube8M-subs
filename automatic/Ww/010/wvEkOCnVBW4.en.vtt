after<00:00:00.630> 20<00:00:00.960> years<00:00:00.989> of<00:00:01.439> stacking<00:00:01.770> wood<00:00:02.190> in

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
after 20 years of stacking wood in

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.390 
after 20 years of stacking wood in
square<00:00:02.850> linear<00:00:03.629> piles<00:00:04.020> I've<00:00:04.830> switched<00:00:05.160> to

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
square linear piles I've switched to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.369 
square linear piles I've switched to
stacking<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:05.879> these<00:00:06.000> round<00:00:06.299> piles<00:00:06.660> for<00:00:07.350> a

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
stacking in these round piles for a

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.259 
stacking in these round piles for a
couple<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.740> good<00:00:07.890> reasons<00:00:07.940> first<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.059> all<00:00:09.150> it's

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
couple of good reasons first of all it's

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.900 
couple of good reasons first of all it's
a<00:00:09.300> lot<00:00:09.330> easier<00:00:09.630> as<00:00:09.990> I'll<00:00:10.650> show<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.730> only

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
a lot easier as I'll show you the only

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.089 
a lot easier as I'll show you the only
way<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.090> actually<00:00:12.269> stack<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.559> wood<00:00:13.950> that

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
way you actually stack is the wood that

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
way you actually stack is the wood that
forms<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.549> outer<00:00:14.580> round<00:00:15.150> walls<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.990> rest<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
forms the outer round walls the rest of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.500 
forms the outer round walls the rest of
the<00:00:16.410> wood<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.650> thrown<00:00:16.920> inside<00:00:17.340> another<00:00:18.180> reason

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the wood is thrown inside another reason

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.480 
the wood is thrown inside another reason
is<00:00:18.630> stability<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.800> build<00:00:20.070> these<00:00:20.220> piles

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
is stability if you build these piles

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.099 
is stability if you build these piles
right<00:00:20.850> they're<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> fall<00:00:22.050> over

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
right they're not going to fall over

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.490 
right they're not going to fall over
like<00:00:22.949> square<00:00:23.490> piles<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.910> often<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.660> they<00:00:25.380> also

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
like square piles so often do they also

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.800 
like square piles so often do they also
look<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:26.130> nice<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.580> they've<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.779> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
look really nice and they've got a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290 
look really nice and they've got a
built-in<00:00:28.529> tarp<00:00:28.949> under<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.490> last<00:00:29.820> layer<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
built-in tarp under this last layer of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.900 
built-in tarp under this last layer of
wood<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> shed<00:00:30.990> water<00:00:31.460> now<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.579> order<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.790> this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
wood to shed water now in order for this

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280 
wood to shed water now in order for this
to<00:00:33.000> work<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> put<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> pile

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
to work right you have to put the pile

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
to work right you have to put the pile
together<00:00:34.500> properly<00:00:35.010> there's<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.640> than

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
together properly there's more than

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.350 
together properly there's more than
meets<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> eye

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
meets the eye

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
meets the eye
and<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> start<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:37.590> showing<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.129> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and want to start by showing you how I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
and want to start by showing you how I
lay<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.940> pile<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> starts<00:00:39.989> off

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
lay out the pile so it starts off

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
lay out the pile so it starts off
perfectly<00:00:40.829> round<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.340> start<00:00:41.969> each<00:00:42.120> round<00:00:42.149> pile

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
perfectly round I start each round pile

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.900 
perfectly round I start each round pile
with<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> 12<00:00:43.469> inch<00:00:43.620> stake<00:00:44.070> pushed<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:44.730> the

ground in the middle of where I want the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
ground in the middle of where I want the
pile<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.910> length<00:00:48.180> of

and keeping that wood plumb by eye as I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.980 
and keeping that wood plumb by eye as I
work<00:01:19.619> higher

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
these piles and as you can see they're

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
I've cut them from the forest they're 8

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.359 
I've cut them from the forest they're 8
feet<00:01:38.180> long<00:01:38.290> which<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.740> same<00:01:39.979> length<00:01:40.220> as

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
four different places in the wood as it

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.320 
four different places in the wood as it
rises<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.460> end<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.759> one<00:01:49.940> here

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
rises you can see the end of one here

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.840 
rises you can see the end of one here
there's<00:01:51.080> other<00:01:51.350> pole<00:01:51.649> ends<00:01:51.979> just<00:01:52.460> like<00:01:52.640> it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
there's other pole ends just like it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.149 
there's other pole ends just like it
further<00:01:53.330> around<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.899> pile<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.680> binds

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
further around the pile that binds

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.370 
further around the pile that binds
everything<00:01:55.580> together<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.300> stops<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.350> from

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
everything together and stops it from

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.740 
everything together and stops it from
breaking<00:01:57.979> outwards<00:01:58.670> under<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.330> pressure<00:01:59.600> of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
breaking outwards under the pressure of

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.109 
breaking outwards under the pressure of
the<00:01:59.869> wood<00:02:00.170> that's<00:02:00.289> contained<00:02:00.800> inside<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.970> do

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the wood that's contained inside you do

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.210 
the wood that's contained inside you do
this<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:03.440> pile<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.800> going<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.009> last

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
this and your pile is going to last

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.820 
this and your pile is going to last
really<00:02:04.640> well<00:02:05.030> for<00:02:05.780> as<00:02:06.080> long<00:02:06.320> as<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.590> need<00:02:06.710> it

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
really well for as long as you need it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.950 
really well for as long as you need it
