the<00:01:03.329> legends<00:01:03.660> class<00:01:03.840> figure<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> never<00:01:04.439> had

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the legends class figure but I never had

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.789 
the legends class figure but I never had
it<00:01:04.739> last<00:01:04.860> class<00:01:05.129> before<00:01:05.240> but<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> went<00:01:07.680> ahead

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it last class before but so I went ahead

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
it last class before but so I went ahead
and<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.189> stalkers<00:01:09.060> Corp<00:01:09.270> Nagi<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.689> part<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and got stalkers Corp Nagi is part of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.660 
and got stalkers Corp Nagi is part of
wave<00:01:10.320> 5<00:01:11.270> together<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.479> swervin<00:01:12.900> RC<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
wave 5 together with swervin RC and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
wave 5 together with swervin RC and
quite<00:01:14.670> frankly<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.930> figure<00:01:16.259> has<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
quite frankly I think this figure has a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.039 
quite frankly I think this figure has a
lot<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> potential<00:01:17.360> perhaps<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.869> good

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
lot of potential perhaps it is as good

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
lot of potential perhaps it is as good
as<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> legends<00:01:20.220> class<00:01:20.430> figure<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:21.000> not

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
as the legends class figure if not

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.499 
as the legends class figure if not

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the figure I mean it how do I say this I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
the figure I mean it how do I say this I
mean<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:59.219> people<00:01:59.460> say<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.119> legs<00:02:00.329> were

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
mean some people say that the legs were

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
mean some people say that the legs were
just<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> forced<00:02:01.079> thing<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.560> mean<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:02.100> needed<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
just a forced thing I mean they needed a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.160 
just a forced thing I mean they needed a
transformation<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.450> figure<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
transformation for this figure and so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.819 
transformation for this figure and so
they<00:02:04.320> gave<00:02:04.469> him<00:02:04.619> legs<00:02:04.890> blah<00:02:05.250> blah<00:02:05.399> blah<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.829> if

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
they gave him legs blah blah blah but if

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.980 
they gave him legs blah blah blah but if
you<00:02:08.009> ask<00:02:08.190> me<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:09.119> think

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
you ask me I think

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.290 
you ask me I think
the<00:02:11.290> legs<00:02:11.500> gives<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:12.280> figure<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.910> lot<00:02:13.120> more

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
the legs gives this figure a lot more

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.440 
the legs gives this figure a lot more
versatility<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:15.280> terms<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.670> articulating<00:02:16.300> him

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
versatility in terms of articulating him

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.620 
versatility in terms of articulating him
and<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:18.070> it's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> good<00:02:18.430> touch<00:02:18.700> I'm

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
and I think it's a good touch I'm

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.990 
and I think it's a good touch I'm
actually<00:02:19.840> very<00:02:20.050> impressed<00:02:20.520> with<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.640> figure

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
actually very impressed with this figure

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.490 
actually very impressed with this figure
the<00:02:22.210> design<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.720> went<00:02:22.930> through<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.200> figure

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the design that went through this figure

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.440 
the design that went through this figure
must<00:02:23.740> have<00:02:23.890> been<00:02:24.040> something<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.090> mean<00:02:25.240> it's<00:02:25.360> not

the best figure of them all but to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.900 
the best figure of them all but to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
actually do something with the with the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.820 
actually do something with the with the
with<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.390> figure<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.810> we've<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.260> seen<00:02:32.410> only

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
with a figure that we've just seen only

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.970 
with a figure that we've just seen only
in<00:02:33.280> animal<00:02:33.880> mode<00:02:34.030> or<00:02:34.360> alt<00:02:34.870> mode<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.560> something

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
in animal mode or alt mode is something

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.250 
in animal mode or alt mode is something
so<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:37.180> know<00:02:37.300> he's<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:37.720> too<00:02:37.840> bad<00:02:38.020> he<00:02:38.140> has<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so you know he's not too bad he has a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.790 
so you know he's not too bad he has a
lot<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.620> potential<00:02:43.110> let<00:02:44.110> me<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.380> stand<00:02:44.680> him

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
lot of potential let me just stand him

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.280 
lot of potential let me just stand him
up<00:02:44.890> straight<00:02:45.510> he<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.630> supposed<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.140> look<00:02:47.230> like

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
up straight he is supposed to look like

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.480 
up straight he is supposed to look like
this<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.790> like<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.150> guy<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.830> teeny

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
this just like that guy but with teeny

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.880 
this just like that guy but with teeny
tiny<00:02:51.820> legs<00:02:54.480> she<00:02:55.480> also<00:02:55.660> looked<00:02:55.960> like<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.380> the
