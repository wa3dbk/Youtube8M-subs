00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.170
 hello everyone with you to the forest and today i 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.820
 I will tell you about aspects of the shooting of SVP 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.309
 now almost every fifth uses 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.320
 sniper rifle for match-making on 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.109
 servers however hone their skills 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.010
 don't want this video is devoted to studying 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.560
 good play at basic level 1 tip 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
 set up a game for yourself a lot of important 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.390
 advice because different players use 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.660
 different settings mouse and game for the sniper 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 does not require great sensitivity 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.079
 recommend using small 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.910
 sensitivity but such that your whole 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.809
 hand during movement could remain 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.960
 on the mat 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.739
 Believe advice is very important for the game for 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.820
 sniper needs even small parts 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.950
 move on to the second tip 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.350
 use most of your time 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.239
 for trained on this video 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.899
 shown as a player in the na'vi team 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.760
 guardian warming up before his game 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.550
 I think most people are sitting in front of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 screen think that the game with bots is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.480
 easy job however recommend you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.420
 try to practice at least once 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.240
 with bots and after that you will stop 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.909
 think so guardian uses this like 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 own warm-up methodology many 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.630
 go to the server from the case however 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.030
 would recommend you walk on them after 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 data training when you are already fully 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.310
 warmed up and ready to play after 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.119
 finish the workout play a couple 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.070
 matchmaking 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.370
 and already there you will reveal all your 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.470
 abilities 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.060
 who wants to learn how to shoot well 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 try to use this 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.440
 workout daily 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.350
 third tip which is more relevant 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.080
 for playing navy using your respawn 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.030
 I think every team has such a player 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.740
 which in spite of its respawn and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.020
 played by its vp 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 after which begins to invent different 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.630
 excuses 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 because of what he was eaten in one way or another 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.700
 place so that this was not 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.310
 I advise you to use your respawn 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.450
 fits on the game in mils especially on 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.690
 dust2 maps 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.670
 inferno mirage and also due to respawn 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.000
 would be nice to leave enemies on the map 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.410
 overpass if you have a bad respawn 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.200
 pass mvp 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.300
 to another player maybe he realizes 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.190
 not even by firing but because 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.160
 that he came running to the point of the arrow 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.120
 before the enemy the last fourth 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.250
 the board is more suitable for team play 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.620
 you all know that the sniper is obliged to sit 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.100
 somewhere far away and reveal your skills 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.959
 there, however, recommended changing positions 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.050
 would you like a sniper chooses tactics 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.910
 under your opponents there are players already 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.140
 used to seeing you on the same 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.690
 point on the map 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.840
 make a surprise for them and find yourself 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.610
 completely unpredictable place this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.230
 advice is very important because 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.650
 professional players often 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.959
 adapt to this or that team 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.080
 often this original game gives 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.600
 its fruits 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.720
 I think our small guide on shooting svp 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.300
