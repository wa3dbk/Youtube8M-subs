on it with the ingredients it's kind of
rubbing<00:03:31.260> off<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.769> will<00:03:32.100> rewrite<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.519> and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
rubbing off but I will rewrite it and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.060 
rubbing off but I will rewrite it and
that's<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.709> way<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.310> keep<00:03:35.549> track<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:37.070> the

that's the way I can keep track of the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.770 
that's the way I can keep track of the
recipe<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.480> worry<00:03:39.690> about

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
recipe so I don't have to worry about

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.180 
recipe so I don't have to worry about
finding<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.590> online<00:03:40.739> again<00:03:41.280> or<00:03:41.549> anything<00:03:42.799> so<00:03:43.799> I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
thing now you see it kind of phones a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.460 
thing now you see it kind of phones a
little<00:04:12.610> bit<00:04:12.790> which<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.599> kind<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.080> weird<00:04:14.290> at

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
little bit which is kind of weird at

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.800 
little bit which is kind of weird at
first<00:04:14.739> until<00:04:15.160> you're<00:04:15.370> used<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.849> it<00:04:16.000> but<00:04:16.660> it

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
first until you're used to it but it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.240 
first until you're used to it but it
foams<00:04:17.139> instantly<00:04:17.979> when<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.430> hits<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.820> surface

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
foams instantly when it hits the surface

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.710 
foams instantly when it hits the surface
so<00:04:21.250> then<00:04:21.430> I'm<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.609> gonna<00:04:21.820> wipe<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:24.720> it's

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
so then I'm just gonna wipe and it's

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.379 
so then I'm just gonna wipe and it's
surprisingly<00:04:26.530> well<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.460> works<00:04:27.760> really<00:04:28.210> really

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
surprisingly well it works really really

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.029 
surprisingly well it works really really
well<00:04:28.720> when<00:04:29.500> you're<00:04:29.530> wiping<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:31.770> thought<00:04:32.770> at

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
well when you're wiping it I thought at

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.310 
well when you're wiping it I thought at
first<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.669> was<00:04:33.699> gonna<00:04:33.970> be<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.660> little

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
first that it was gonna be a little

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.300 
first that it was gonna be a little
streaky<00:04:36.039> or<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.389> would<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.250> don't

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
streaky or that it would just I don't

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.770 
streaky or that it would just I don't
know<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.550> wasn't<00:04:39.820> really<00:04:40.030> sure<00:04:40.360> what<00:04:40.389> would

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
know I wasn't really sure what would

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
know I wasn't really sure what would
happen<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.500> was<00:04:41.710> kind<00:04:41.949> of<00:04:42.039> concerned<00:04:42.520> but<00:04:43.800> it

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
happen so I was kind of concerned but it

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.840 
happen so I was kind of concerned but it
does<00:04:45.160> work<00:04:46.590> now<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.620> do<00:04:47.800> have<00:04:48.100> that<00:04:48.280> tough<00:04:48.520> spot

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
does work now I do have that tough spot

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.490 
does work now I do have that tough spot
on<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.210> side<00:04:49.449> there<00:04:49.780> I'm<00:04:49.900> going<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.110> squirt<00:04:50.440> a

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
on the side there I'm going to squirt a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.740 
on the side there I'm going to squirt a
little<00:04:50.949> bit<00:04:51.070> more<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.740> see<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.070> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
little bit more and you can see that it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.790 
little bit more and you can see that it
definitely<00:04:55.750> like<00:04:56.020> bubbles<00:04:58.289> now<00:04:59.289> it<00:04:59.410> won't<00:04:59.560> get

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
definitely like bubbles now it won't get

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.460 
definitely like bubbles now it won't get
all<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.250> off<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.180> will<00:05:01.419> do<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:02.139> good

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
all of that off but it will do a good

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.460 
all of that off but it will do a good
job<00:05:02.530> at<00:05:03.099> least<00:05:03.630> for<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.660> window<00:05:04.960> cleaner<00:05:05.139> that

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
job at least for a window cleaner that

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.270 
job at least for a window cleaner that
you<00:05:05.590> made<00:05:05.830> in<00:05:06.010> your<00:05:06.130> own<00:05:06.190> home<00:05:07.740> all<00:05:08.740> right<00:05:08.950> so

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
you made in your own home all right so

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.260 
you made in your own home all right so
I'm<00:05:09.400> not<00:05:09.550> sure<00:05:09.729> if<00:05:09.820> you<00:05:09.910> can<00:05:10.030> tell<00:05:10.090> the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
I'm not sure if you can tell the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.980 
I'm not sure if you can tell the
difference<00:05:10.840> but<00:05:11.289> it<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.919> very<00:05:12.099> shiny<00:05:12.750> no<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.780> do

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
difference but it is very shiny no I do

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.440 
difference but it is very shiny no I do
also<00:05:14.320> have<00:05:14.580> some<00:05:15.580> stuff<00:05:15.820> on<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.060> mirror<00:05:16.360> I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
also have some stuff on the mirror I

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.469 
also have some stuff on the mirror I
need<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.840> get<00:05:16.960> off<00:05:17.139> now<00:05:17.789> like<00:05:18.789> I<00:05:18.940> said<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.300> does

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
need to get off now like I said it does

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.950 
need to get off now like I said it does
fizz<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.860> will<00:05:21.130> drip<00:05:21.820> really<00:05:22.360> fast

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
fizz and it will drip really fast

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.080 
fizz and it will drip really fast
so<00:05:23.500> if<00:05:24.430> that's<00:05:24.639> a<00:05:24.849> problem<00:05:25.000> for<00:05:25.330> you<00:05:25.720> then<00:05:27.090> you

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
so if that's a problem for you then you

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.490 
so if that's a problem for you then you
should<00:05:28.150> probably<00:05:29.849> do<00:05:30.849> it<00:05:31.030> on<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:32.050> on<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.320> paper

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
should probably do it on it on the paper

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.180 
should probably do it on it on the paper
towel<00:05:32.740> first<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.490> then<00:05:33.820> it'll<00:05:34.479> work<00:05:34.889> now<00:05:35.889> it's

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
towel first and then it'll work now it's

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.339 
towel first and then it'll work now it's
going<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.520> right<00:05:37.180> now<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.360> can<00:05:37.750> see<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.260> I'm

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
going to right now I can see it but I'm

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.290 
going to right now I can see it but I'm
sure<00:05:38.410> it's<00:05:38.680> hard<00:05:38.919> for<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.280> see<00:05:39.580> it's<00:05:39.849> kind

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
sure it's hard for you to see it's kind

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.810 
sure it's hard for you to see it's kind
of<00:05:40.450> not<00:05:40.870> dry<00:05:41.229> yet<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:41.889> it's<00:05:42.099> going<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.430> have

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
of not dry yet so it's going to have

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
of not dry yet so it's going to have
some<00:05:44.430> look<00:05:45.430> like<00:05:45.669> it<00:05:45.880> will<00:05:45.940> be<00:05:46.030> streaky<00:05:46.599> but

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
some look like it will be streaky but

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.080 
some look like it will be streaky but
once<00:05:47.200> it<00:05:47.440> gets<00:05:47.680> dried<00:05:48.039> all<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.460> way<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.940> once

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
once it gets dried all the way and once

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.540 
once it gets dried all the way and once
you<00:05:49.300> wipe<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.660> off<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:50.080> won't<00:05:50.770> be<00:05:50.949> streaky<00:05:51.400> at

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
you wipe it off it won't be streaky at

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.990 
you wipe it off it won't be streaky at
all<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:52.720> streaks<00:05:53.020> will<00:05:53.229> go<00:05:53.349> away<00:05:53.699> so<00:05:54.699> don't<00:05:54.820> be

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
all the streaks will go away so don't be

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.580 
all the streaks will go away so don't be
concerned<00:05:55.389> if<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:55.690> see<00:05:55.930> it<00:05:56.080> a<00:05:56.139> little<00:05:56.260> a<00:05:56.410> few

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
concerned if you see it a little a few

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.159 
concerned if you see it a little a few
streaks<00:05:56.949> on<00:05:57.250> your<00:05:57.520> on<00:05:58.270> your<00:05:58.539> mirror<00:05:58.840> or<00:05:58.990> your

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
windows because it will dry it off which

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.820 
windows because it will dry it off which
is<00:06:02.260> why<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.440> rubbing<00:06:02.919> alcohol<00:06:03.039> is<00:06:03.700> in<00:06:04.060> it<00:06:04.830> now

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
is why the rubbing alcohol is in it now

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.800 
is why the rubbing alcohol is in it now
I'm<00:06:06.010> also<00:06:06.219> going<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.789> try<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.180> get<00:06:07.270> in<00:06:07.450> the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
I'm also going to try and get in the

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.490 
I'm also going to try and get in the
how<00:06:08.350> it<00:06:08.410> fizzes<00:06:09.540> but<00:06:10.650> even<00:06:11.650> though<00:06:11.830> it's<00:06:13.169> not<00:06:14.169> a

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
how it fizzes but even though it's not a

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.330 
how it fizzes but even though it's not a
heavy<00:06:15.130> cleaning<00:06:15.550> agent<00:06:16.440> you<00:06:17.440> can<00:06:17.650> already<00:06:17.980> see

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
heavy cleaning agent you can already see

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.330 
heavy cleaning agent you can already see
the<00:06:18.370> difference<00:06:18.970> between<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.530> one<00:06:20.740> side<00:06:21.040> and

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
the difference between the one side and

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.790 
the difference between the one side and
that<00:06:21.430> other<00:06:21.730> side<00:06:22.139> so<00:06:23.139> that's<00:06:23.320> pretty<00:06:23.620> awesome

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
that other side so that's pretty awesome

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.180 
that other side so that's pretty awesome
because<00:06:24.460> this<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.240> an<00:06:25.330> easy<00:06:25.600> way<00:06:25.870> to<00:06:26.230> quickly

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
because this is an easy way to quickly

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.290

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
wasn't really sure if it would do

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.080 
wasn't really sure if it would do
anything<00:06:55.750> but<00:06:56.500> I<00:06:56.740> used<00:06:57.100> it<00:06:57.250> to<00:06:57.400> clean<00:06:57.700> my<00:06:57.880> house
