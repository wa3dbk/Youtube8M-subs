that's<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> truth<00:01:22.760> sometimes<00:01:23.760> it's<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:25.530> know

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.520 

to<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.840> obviously<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.409> know

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to you what it is but obviously you know

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.780 
to you what it is but obviously you know
I<00:01:34.740> made<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.920> pretty<00:01:35.070> clear<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.400> I've<00:01:35.549> been<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I made it pretty clear that I've been to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.330 
I made it pretty clear that I've been to
see<00:01:35.940> someone<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.890> let's<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.190> say

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
see someone and you know let's just say

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.969 
see someone and you know let's just say
that<00:01:38.610> um<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> positive<00:01:40.320> thing<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.740> me

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that um it was a positive thing for me

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.320 
that um it was a positive thing for me
to<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.430> obviously<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.940> want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> carry

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
to do because obviously I want to carry

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.109 
to do because obviously I want to carry
on<00:01:42.450> playing<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.700> nothing<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
on playing so you know it's nothing to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
on playing so you know it's nothing to
do<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.479> making<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> better<00:01:46.350> snooker

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
do with making me a better snooker

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.789 
do with making me a better snooker
player<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.640> allowing<00:01:47.880> me<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> be

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
player but just allowing me to be

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
player but just allowing me to be
probably<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.950> 99%<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> uppers<00:01:51.150> new<00:01:51.270> players

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
probably like 99% the uppers new players

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.060 
probably like 99% the uppers new players
how<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.960> feel<00:01:52.260> when<00:01:52.560> they're<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:52.830> you
