man<00:01:21.030> can't<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.920> his<00:01:23.100> arm<00:01:24.049> feature

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

but<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> don't<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> point<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
but I don't see the point of that so I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.810 
but I don't see the point of that so I
don't<00:01:33.420> think<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> only<00:01:33.900> needed<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> yeah

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
don't think you only needed that so yeah

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.130 
don't think you only needed that so yeah
um<00:01:36.170> paint<00:01:37.170> job<00:01:37.409> well<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.930> nothing<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
um paint job well this is nothing like

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.170

the<00:01:40.320> movie<00:01:42.710> he<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.430> brown<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the movie he was more like brown and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
the movie he was more like brown and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.249 
believe there's a figure like that out
there<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:50.939> very<00:01:51.119> accurate<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:52.049> he

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259

figure like that so I'm not really that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.370 
figure like that so I'm not really that
mad<00:01:57.479> about<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.460> yeah<00:01:59.509> um<00:02:00.509> anyway<00:02:01.350> so
