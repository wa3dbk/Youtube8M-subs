00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
I'm about three or four yards away from

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.430 
I'm about three or four yards away from
the<00:00:49.530> wall<00:00:49.739> where<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> start<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:51.440> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the wall where I start right there you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.779 
the wall where I start right there you
find<00:00:52.680> most<00:00:52.829> guys<00:00:53.070> they'll<00:00:53.340> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.700> do

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
find most guys they'll kind of just do

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
find most guys they'll kind of just do
what's<00:00:53.940> coming<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.450> our<00:00:55.379> other<00:00:55.559> kicker

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
what's coming for them our other kicker

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
what's coming for them our other kicker
here<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> shuffle<00:00:57.510> step<00:00:57.719> sideways<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
here does a shuffle step sideways and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
here does a shuffle step sideways and
he's<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.980> closer<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.640> am<00:00:59.789> could<00:01:00.750> be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
he's a lot closer than I am could be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
he's a lot closer than I am could be
because<00:01:00.930> he's<00:01:01.110> smaller<00:01:01.379> could<00:01:01.800> base<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.010> more

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
because he's smaller could base it more

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.060 
because he's smaller could base it more
comfortable<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.070> near

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
comfortable that's about that I near

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.340 
comfortable that's about that I near
approach<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.520> ball<00:01:05.729> want<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> find<00:01:07.229> your

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
approach the ball want to find your

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
approach the ball want to find your
plant<00:01:07.619> spot<00:01:07.920> where<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.220> ball<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> be

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
plant spot where the ball is going to be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
plant spot where the ball is going to be
so<00:01:09.810> you're<00:01:09.930> looking<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.289> spot<00:01:10.470> where<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
so you're looking at the spot where the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.520 
so you're looking at the spot where the
holders<00:01:10.979> holding<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> ball<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:12.410> at<00:01:13.410> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
holders holding the ball and at that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
holders holding the ball and at that
point<00:01:13.770> take<00:01:14.759> your<00:01:14.880> normal<00:01:14.970> steps<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.539> every

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
point take your normal steps on every

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.910 
point take your normal steps on every
kick<00:01:15.959> the<00:01:16.140> matter<00:01:16.319> where<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
kick the matter where you are in the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
kick the matter where you are in the
field<00:01:17.069> where<00:01:17.759> you're<00:01:17.880> kicking<00:01:18.179> how<00:01:18.479> far

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
field where you're kicking how far

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.490 
field where you're kicking how far
doesn't<00:01:19.020> matter<00:01:20.509> go<00:01:21.509> forward<00:01:21.929> hit<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.289> ball

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
doesn't matter go forward hit the ball

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.900 
doesn't matter go forward hit the ball
and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.920> guess<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> primary<00:01:23.520> thing<00:01:23.550> from<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
and I guess the primary thing from that

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.570 
and I guess the primary thing from that
point<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.979> keeping<00:01:25.979> your<00:01:26.099> head<00:01:26.190> down<00:01:26.250> after

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
point is keeping your head down after

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.400 
point is keeping your head down after
you<00:01:26.759> hit<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.450> golf's<00:01:27.869> will<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> pick<00:01:28.319> your

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
you hit it so golf's will you pick your

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.990 
you hit it so golf's will you pick your
head<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.130> balls<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.429> we<00:01:29.550> going<00:01:29.729> left<00:01:29.910> for

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
head up the balls and we going left for

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.089 
head up the balls and we going left for
the<00:01:30.060> ball<00:01:30.209> so<00:01:30.330> we<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.539> right<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.039> to

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
the ball so we go right if you want to

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.190 
the ball so we go right if you want to
get<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.340> specifics<00:01:32.849> of<00:01:32.910> certain<00:01:33.209> things<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
get the specifics of certain things you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.359 
get the specifics of certain things you
know<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.649> to<00:01:34.740> worry<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.890> where<00:01:35.250> your

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
know you got to worry about where your

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.919 
know you got to worry about where your
legs<00:01:35.580> going<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.179> you're<00:01:36.300> swinging<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
legs going if you're swinging at the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.030 
legs going if you're swinging at the
ball<00:01:36.959> if<00:01:37.440> you're<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.099> just<00:01:38.459> kicking<00:01:38.789> it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
ball if you're actually just kicking it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.070 
ball if you're actually just kicking it
I<00:01:40.100> guess<00:01:41.090> after<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.750> figure<00:01:41.990> out<00:01:42.020> your

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
I guess after that you figure out your

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.720 
I guess after that you figure out your
follow-through<00:01:42.500> where<00:01:42.860> your<00:01:42.980> arms<00:01:43.010> are<00:01:43.400> going

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
follow-through where your arms are going
