not a huge fan of it anymore I was
liking<00:05:04.909> for<00:05:05.359> a<00:05:05.389> while<00:05:05.569> I<00:05:06.019> guess<00:05:06.949> it<00:05:07.129> also

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:07.279 
liking for a while I guess it also

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.969 
liking for a while I guess it also
depends<00:05:07.879> on<00:05:07.939> the<00:05:07.999> map<00:05:08.269> like<00:05:08.659> half<00:05:09.319> of<00:05:09.529> this<00:05:09.679> map

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
depends on the map like half of this map

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:18.339 
depends on the map like half of this map
is<00:05:10.449> under<00:05:11.469> umbrage<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.919> this<00:05:16.299> this<00:05:17.299> PDW<00:05:17.689> just

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
is under umbrage so this this PDW just

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.549 
is under umbrage so this this PDW just
to<00:05:18.499> reiterate<00:05:18.649> I<00:05:19.429> like<00:05:20.419> it<00:05:20.689> the<00:05:20.989> select-fire

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:21.559 
to reiterate I like it the select-fire

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.699 
to reiterate I like it the select-fire
because<00:05:22.129> low<00:05:22.459> recoil<00:05:22.699> you<00:05:23.389> can<00:05:24.259> still<00:05:24.559> win

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:24.709 
because low recoil you can still win

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:27.009 
because low recoil you can still win
those<00:05:24.949> close-range<00:05:25.489> gunfights<00:05:26.119> you<00:05:26.809> know<00:05:26.929> you

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:27.019 
those close-range gunfights you know you

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:30.489 
those close-range gunfights you know you
can<00:05:27.259> win<00:05:27.529> immerse<00:05:27.919> people<00:05:28.489> sometimes<00:05:29.499> like

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:30.499 
can win immerse people sometimes like

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:34.329 
can win immerse people sometimes like
that<00:05:30.739> guy<00:05:30.919> was<00:05:31.129> a<00:05:31.459> one<00:05:32.269> burst<00:05:32.509> or<00:05:32.899> if<00:05:33.019> not<00:05:33.709> very

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:34.339 
that guy was a one burst or if not very

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:39.489 
that guy was a one burst or if not very
close<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.879> it<00:05:36.069> and<00:05:37.569> so<00:05:38.569> yeah<00:05:38.749> the<00:05:39.079> select-fire

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:39.499 
close to it and so yeah the select-fire

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.559 
close to it and so yeah the select-fire
don't<00:05:40.369> feel<00:05:40.579> like<00:05:40.729> I'm<00:05:40.939> at<00:05:41.119> a<00:05:41.149> disadvantage

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
don't feel like I'm at a disadvantage

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.949 
don't feel like I'm at a disadvantage
close<00:05:42.169> range<00:05:42.529> and<00:05:43.459> I<00:05:43.759> feel<00:05:44.029> like<00:05:44.209> I'm<00:05:44.419> much

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:44.959 
close range and I feel like I'm much

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.999 
close range and I feel like I'm much
better<00:05:45.289> off<00:05:45.409> at<00:05:45.889> longer<00:05:46.159> ranges<00:05:47.619> so<00:05:48.619> try<00:05:48.979> that

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
better off at longer ranges so try that

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.309 
better off at longer ranges so try that
