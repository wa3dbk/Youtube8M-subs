00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
messed up when I was breaking this into

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.639 
messed up when I was breaking this into
because<00:00:49.829> um<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.480> need<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> pocket<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.500> too

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
because um I need to pocket a little too

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 
because um I need to pocket a little too
deep<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> corner<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
deep right there like in the corner and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
deep right there like in the corner and
it<00:00:55.649> gets<00:00:55.890> stuck<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.460> sometimes<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it gets stuck in there sometimes and I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
it gets stuck in there sometimes and I
don't<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.399> overall<00:00:59.399> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
don't really like that but overall it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.010 
don't really like that but overall it's
pretty<00:00:59.730> good<00:01:00.030> I've<00:01:00.239> had<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.899> a

anyone to the web broke in half I'm is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.990 
anyone to the web broke in half I'm is
the<00:01:21.990> second<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.369> pitcher

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the second one I have is my pitcher

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.719 
the second one I have is my pitcher
glove<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.720> pitch<00:01:24.960> too<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:26.340> tighten

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
glove because I pitch too I just tighten

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
glove because I pitch too I just tighten
this<00:01:26.850> earlier<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.259> little

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this earlier so it's like a little

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
this earlier so it's like a little
harder<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> close<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.689> am<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.079> did<00:01:31.259> too

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
harder to close now and I am I did too

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.679 
harder to close now and I am I did too
in<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> pinky<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.090> makes<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> pocket

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
in the pinky because it makes the pocket

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.999 
in the pinky because it makes the pocket
deeper<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.320> hide<00:01:34.530> your<00:01:34.650> pitches<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
deeper so you can hide your pitches a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.190 
deeper so you can hide your pitches a
little<00:01:35.250> better<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.509> rolling<00:01:36.960> pro

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
little better and it's a rolling pro

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
little better and it's a rolling pro
