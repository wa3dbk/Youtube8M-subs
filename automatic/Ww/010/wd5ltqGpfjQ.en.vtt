00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 mario to r 10 is this game will be the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.670

 scrooge figurines those ones 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 Little dolls are you going to put a game 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.789
 similar to skylane so it will be 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.619
 compatible with this game also does not know 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 exactly as yet but only they 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 they released these images here of gameplay 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.590
 if you played the most you know that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 This fun game to play and with many 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
 people four people less time in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.380
 two wings a party is easy to play with 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.210
 family has because it is very simple to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.500
 gameplay can play there with your father 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 how had only ever played 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.719
 videogame and has that part of the board 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 which I find particularly annoying 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.410
 I played with people who understand 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.210
 I played those people who want to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.829
 simply come and play in our 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 different when it comes to board 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.440
 person gets a little like this but he 's very still 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.149
 huh 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.469
 it is logical to compare with the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.420
 which is much cooler 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.910
 much more a year much more attractive 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 but it is not more attractive not attractive 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 are the mini games that have this part of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 board that defends before 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 fall in the bathroom, you'll have to do 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 movies and games even without 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.790
 mnmc's director to play and when she 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.100
 Then you came back to live in the games. 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 first nobody appears here, theobald 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.240
 there and all your characters are 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 inside a roulette and what to do 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.400
 is this all you have to do has to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 keep moving because they run and have to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.270
 besides the whole sertão stirring here ops no 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.070
 may stand still and back are royalty 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.549
 started to tinker with the scheme on the front 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.799
 have to keep stirring stopped in cech 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.740
 noticed that they had to burn burning 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 in front nice guy is very simple but it is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.930
 well this window even there you with 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.729
 few moves have fun with 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.320
 My next step here is a 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.630
 Good to see big and have your 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.119
 characters there in the square with your sina 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 on top of a fleeing tower then 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.390
 that looking at the head of the neighborhood is 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.490
 When will he spit fire to stay? 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.200
 Fleeing from the fire I do not know that in the middle 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.270
 he is comfortable suddenly he plays 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.950
 fireball in the middle and grab everyone 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 then the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.240
 You have some lives and you lose 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.500
 a deal with 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.580
 the fire of the good jesus came no one 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.290
 here is always so game house well 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.570
 simple and coolest thing of all is when 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 You have something that can end the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.860
 character then in this game that by 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.200
 example here appears you just had to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.600
 to divert but have some that you play 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.300
 your opponent in the hole and that's cool 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.970
 that this other Mario game for 10 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.770
 It's like a dump so there's two 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.730
 sticks that keep throwing these balls 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.350
 of iron 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.570
 these thorn balls and you have to 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.150
 running a legal fee because here 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.340
 ago the romario made more time in lance 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.220
 that may the rally has no one hidden 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 back you take I pushed it back to 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.460
 behind every way thus protecting 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.740
 It's not enough to stand alone behind the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.320
 Ball beats and turns everything colorful 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.060
 fun gameplay very simple and 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.890
 This mini game is interesting because there 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.490
 Do you run away from the lovebirds? 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.810
 part of the game pad you 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.640
 stirring so he does not touch the floor either 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.660
 makes you carryal fall from one side pro 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.970
 other is actually does not load does 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.910
 this left wilkins platform right 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.440
 then the guy control can screw the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.270
 little friends 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.850

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.800
