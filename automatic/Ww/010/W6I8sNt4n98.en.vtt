00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
memories of Trevor I thought he competed

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
memories of Trevor I thought he competed
like<00:01:36.120> a<00:01:36.180> real<00:01:36.540> champion<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.290> real<00:01:37.560> captain<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
like a real champion a real captain and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.420 
like a real champion a real captain and
he<00:01:39.060> delivered<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.690> clutch<00:01:39.810> he<00:01:40.770> always<00:01:41.220> had

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
he delivered in the clutch he always had

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.150 
he delivered in the clutch he always had
the<00:01:41.610> ability<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:42.330> elevate<00:01:42.540> his<00:01:43.020> game<00:01:43.080> at<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
the ability to elevate his game at this

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.850 
the ability to elevate his game at this
time<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.520> year<00:01:44.700> at<00:01:45.060> playoff<00:01:45.540> time<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.230> I<00:01:46.620> think

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
time of year at playoff time and I think

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.200 
time of year at playoff time and I think
that's<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.190> thing<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.760> Vancouver

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that's the thing that the Vancouver

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
that's the thing that the Vancouver
hockey<00:01:48.450> fans<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:48.990> always<00:01:49.320> remember<00:01:49.590> about
