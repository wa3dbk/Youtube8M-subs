00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 the staff is fine with you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.059
 where will I show you how to say four 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.010
 different hair types all of them are 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.969
 arrested a lot of people asked me then I 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.190
 did that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.170
 it is us who subscribe to the channel and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:24.510
 liked the video too like the page 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:26.670
 facebook 's big twitter and let's go 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 start our tutorial today 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.430
 good, how's it for training hair? 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.370
 I like to stay saying tax cimpor 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.920
 who loses a lot of time with taste is despite 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 to be good to practice but I ended up 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 thinking better to get ready taste then 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.219
 if you want the face ready 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:51.059
 look for did not chart on google that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.030
 You'll find it good to make this coke. 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.800
 first I drew an outline of it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.780
 so just a hair as if she 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.329
 had short hair and then a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 ball to always make shadow of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.629
 down up and top down 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.629
 as you can see 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.290
 a little ball from above you can make 6 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.420
 random going from side to side as 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.250
 if you were doing the lashes because 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.330
 After all, it's all messy, it's not 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.940
 right 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.340
 so just do it but the same thing 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.710
 in the extremities begins strong determines 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.020
 leads to your impression of sound lights and 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.930
 I then bagged a loose 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.930
 half way to give more charm 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 stripped 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.149
 second hairstyle will be a 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.060
 ponytail trapped or on top of the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.369
 head and side then do the side 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.869
 right but I feel free by the side 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.360
 left if you want 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.790
 then the first always outline drawing 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.819
 with pencil 2d and then take the boat 6b 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.319
 to do but only then is it good for you to do 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.300
 the outline before to have a notion 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.180
 what will happen with just cause 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.600
 so just do it again then 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.040
 start the singer and making the little ones 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.980
 and the root pulls from the root toward the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.530
 center and always clearing the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.360
 ends only took a sandwich lots 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.200
 in the morning the business of doing more 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.239
 dark but clear that it will work 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.510
 same way with the colored pencil makes more 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.510
 points 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.330
 and from there the threads you pull everything in 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.980
 direction where the hair was wrong 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.120
 because it will pull everyone have to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.120
 get in that direction 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.070
 to make a pull on the side only pull 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.310
 also from top to bottom 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.990
 up and tail the same thing 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.100
 always the same way that you are 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.580
 looking there makes it clearer in the middle and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.580
 fall down 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.260
 if you are jealous than having that one tied 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.750
 I want to do an act on the floor a little 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.280
 more increment just pay and have a steel 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.920
 place where you can see how they are 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.110
 creating a bond that goes that way 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.590
 stay different but feminine it depends 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.849
 You can not even do what you want. 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.849
 to understand why you want to eat 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.340
 the third hairstyle will be a tail of 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.500
 horse too but he will be more at 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.930
 down and pull the hair to the side 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.240
 in the same written circulation 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.510
 then it will be well of those chopped 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.070
 well the name of the usa vine behind the ear 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:45.560
 and will leave there on the side in the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:50.060
 left side the same schematic begins to 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:54.470
 from the root of her hair by pulling the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.120
 lines and then on the other hand always 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.130
 following the lines always follows the direction 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.640
 the hair with the hair turns the lines 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.640
 beak 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.010
 and down there is just like you 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.010
 did before another hairstyle 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.930
 the latest hairstyle will be a chic maria 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.690
 think lower can be so 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.590
 effective if you do not start by 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:59.990
 fringe of her tire 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:03.800
 the course of it I'll draw and it will 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.270
 fall off this piece of hair and it will 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960
 to disappear more or less there in the jaw 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.360
 her 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.820
 the idea over there where it will vanish you 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.220
 draws I think small and should be a 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:18.920
 father who did not smoke hair that will be 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:22.160
 the teams of the then to the same scheme I 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.140
 I started with the fringe because that's what 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.150
 usually starts to do the front 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.580
 there it will completely fulfill the 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.440
 her party because of how the crime of 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.470
 ink in graphite so it will not get 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.550
 seeming in some way but the idea 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.890
 not appear 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.580
 I already made there little piece of 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:43.750
 fringe to start the tinga too and I did 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.750
 another side of hair 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.910
 I tried to cover her ears too. 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.310
 so I did I think this if you want 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.330
 books can also make a side can 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:00.000
 put what you want and then the 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.210
 same scheme of the inputs so hair 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.180
 also hair starts strong and goes 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:09.480
 getting light and low starting strong and 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.950
 will take on the light too and do the same 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.950
 thing of the two facts 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.150
 This was the tutorial I hope today 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.860
 You liked to see in the gorge. 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.860
 beauty is more
