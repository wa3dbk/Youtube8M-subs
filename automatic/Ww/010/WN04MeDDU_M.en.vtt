plants go to seed so there's always

that<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:45.040> producing<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.880> lot<00:02:46.120> more<00:02:46.650> now

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
that is it's producing a lot more now

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.710 
that is it's producing a lot more now
because<00:02:47.860> it's<00:02:48.250> producing<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.850> lot<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
because it's producing a lot more you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.560 
because it's producing a lot more you
have<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.900> put<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> little<00:02:50.380> bit<00:02:50.560> into<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.100> well

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
have to put a little bit into it as well

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.390 
have to put a little bit into it as well
but<00:02:52.570> i'm<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.930> talking<00:02:53.230> about<00:02:53.260> hard<00:02:53.739> anthony

but i'm not talking about hard anthony
i'm<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.090> talking<00:02:55.330> about<00:02:55.380> compost<00:02:56.380> what

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
i'm just talking about compost what

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.949 
i'm just talking about compost what
we're<00:02:57.220> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.400> try<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.480> set<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.780> a

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
we're going to try to do is set up a

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.500 
we're going to try to do is set up a
system<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.760> bring<00:03:00.970> nutrients

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
system so that when you bring nutrients

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.050 
system so that when you bring nutrients
into<00:03:01.840> your<00:03:01.959> life<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.769> kept<00:03:03.130> them<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.519> your

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
into your life it kept them in your

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.300 
into your life it kept them in your
system<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.410> put<00:03:05.709> them<00:03:05.799> into<00:03:05.980> your<00:03:06.160> garden

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
system and you put them into your garden

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.300 
system and you put them into your garden
through<00:03:06.880> your<00:03:07.090> composting<00:03:07.690> system<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.190> then

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
through your composting system and then

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.539 
through your composting system and then
you<00:03:09.400> eat<00:03:09.610> them<00:03:09.850> your<00:03:10.420> EP<00:03:10.810> our<00:03:10.989> plans<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.709> then

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
you eat them your EP our plans and then

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.060 
you eat them your EP our plans and then
anyways<00:03:13.360> goes<00:03:13.690> back<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.079> your<00:03:14.170> compost<00:03:14.590> so

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
anyways goes back to your compost so

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.860 
anyways goes back to your compost so
you're<00:03:15.190> getting<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.459> nice<00:03:15.640> nutrient<00:03:16.269> flow<00:03:16.510> and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
you're getting a nice nutrient flow and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.960 
you're getting a nice nutrient flow and
I<00:03:17.260> cycling

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
I cycling

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.030 
I cycling
now<00:03:19.970> we're<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.239> traditional<00:03:20.900> garden<00:03:21.319> what<00:03:22.010> I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
now we're the traditional garden what I

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.570 
now we're the traditional garden what I
won't<00:03:22.670> be<00:03:22.849> find<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.450> when<00:03:23.480> these<00:03:23.930> empty<00:03:24.349> spaces

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
won't be find is when these empty spaces

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.520 
won't be find is when these empty spaces
get<00:03:25.580> filled<00:03:25.879> with<00:03:26.090> weeds<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.810> first<00:03:27.230> thing

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
get filled with weeds the first thing

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.710 
get filled with weeds the first thing
the<00:03:27.680> traditional<00:03:28.250> gardener<00:03:28.700> does<00:03:28.879> is<00:03:29.360> dig

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
the traditional gardener does is dig

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.440 
the traditional gardener does is dig
those<00:03:29.930> weeds<00:03:30.260> over<00:03:31.000> now<00:03:32.000> there's<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.239> few

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
those weeds over now there's a few

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.089 
those weeds over now there's a few
problems<00:03:32.599> with<00:03:32.900> doing<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.409> what<00:03:33.890> they're

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
problems with doing that what they're

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.390 
problems with doing that what they're
doing<00:03:34.129> is<00:03:34.640> they're<00:03:34.930> taking<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.379> dry<00:03:36.709> crusty

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.670 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty
structureless<00:03:37.970> soil<00:03:38.450> that's<00:03:38.900> lying<00:03:39.379> on<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
structureless soil that's lying on the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.380 
structureless soil that's lying on the
top<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.129> they're<00:03:40.579> turning<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.000> over<00:03:41.120> and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
top and they're turning it over and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.509 
top and they're turning it over and
putting<00:03:41.629> it<00:03:41.720> underneath<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:42.409> that<00:03:43.250> soil

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
putting it underneath and that soil

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.759 
putting it underneath and that soil
underneath<00:03:43.849> has<00:03:44.150> got<00:03:44.360> good<00:03:44.599> structure<00:03:45.110> but

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
underneath has got good structure but

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.319 
underneath has got good structure but
now<00:03:45.920> you're<00:03:46.069> putting<00:03:46.370> on<00:03:46.459> top<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.000> it's<00:03:47.150> going

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
now you're putting on top and it's going

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.000 
now you're putting on top and it's going
to<00:03:47.390> dry<00:03:47.659> out<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.170> tell<00:03:48.409> lose<00:03:48.709> its

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
to dry out and you tell lose its

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.990 
to dry out and you tell lose its
structure<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.840> problem<00:03:51.410> was<00:03:51.620> weeds<00:03:51.980> but<00:03:52.700> now

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
structure the problem was weeds but now

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.599 
structure the problem was weeds but now
you've<00:03:53.390> created<00:03:53.629> a<00:03:53.930> new<00:03:54.170> problem<00:03:54.440> we<00:03:55.160> created

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
you've created a new problem we created

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.670 
you've created a new problem we created
the<00:03:55.670> problem<00:03:55.910> of<00:03:56.180> having<00:03:56.359> structureless<00:03:57.109> soil

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
the problem of having structureless soil

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.039 
the problem of having structureless soil
now<00:03:58.340> structuralist<00:03:59.000> soil<00:03:59.359> has<00:03:59.599> its<00:03:59.870> own

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
now structuralist soil has its own

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.920 
now structuralist soil has its own
problems<00:04:00.519> firstly<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.609> can't<00:04:01.910> hold<00:04:02.150> water<00:04:02.299> as

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
problems firstly it can't hold water as

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.800 
problems firstly it can't hold water as
well<00:04:03.470> as<00:04:03.769> good<00:04:04.340> structured<00:04:04.940> soil<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:05.720> you're

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
well as good structured soil so you're

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.509 
well as good structured soil so you're
going<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.989> have<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.170> put<00:04:06.319> more<00:04:06.500> water<00:04:06.769> into

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
going to have to put more water into

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.059 
going to have to put more water into
your<00:04:07.579> garden<00:04:07.930> now<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.049> other<00:04:09.349> problem<00:04:09.920> that

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
your garden now the other problem that

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.460 
your garden now the other problem that
causes<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:11.359> can't<00:04:11.690> pass<00:04:11.989> on<00:04:12.290> the

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
causes is you can't pass on the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.529 
causes is you can't pass on the
nutrients<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.220> plans<00:04:13.579> as<00:04:14.260> effectively<00:04:16.539> so

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
nutrients to the plans as effectively so

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.599 
nutrients to the plans as effectively so
we<00:04:17.690> started<00:04:18.169> out<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.500> weed<00:04:18.799> problem<00:04:19.280> and

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
we started out with a weed problem and

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.360 
we started out with a weed problem and
now<00:04:19.850> we've<00:04:20.030> got<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.389> problem<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.989> soil<00:04:21.889> that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
now we've got the problem of soil that

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.089 
now we've got the problem of soil that
doesn't<00:04:22.729> hold<00:04:22.880> water<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.680> we've<00:04:24.680> also<00:04:24.860> got

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
doesn't hold water and we've also got

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.460 
doesn't hold water and we've also got
the<00:04:25.220> problem<00:04:25.639> of<00:04:25.760> soil<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.539> doesn't<00:04:26.930> pass<00:04:27.260> on

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
the problem of soil that doesn't pass on

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.219 
the problem of soil that doesn't pass on
its<00:04:27.620> nutrients<00:04:28.190> so<00:04:28.610> now<00:04:28.789> we<00:04:28.849> have<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.120> add

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
its nutrients so now we have to add

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.379 
its nutrients so now we have to add
inorganic<00:04:30.229> fertilizers<00:04:31.130> now<00:04:31.940> when<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.240> do

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
inorganic fertilizers now when you do

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.420 
inorganic fertilizers now when you do
that<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:33.050> start<00:04:33.289> to<00:04:33.410> kill<00:04:33.650> all<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.979> all<00:04:34.370> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
that you start to kill all the all the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.820 
that you start to kill all the all the
biological<00:04:35.419> life<00:04:35.660> that's<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.229> soil<00:04:36.530> and

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
biological life that's in the soil and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.129 
biological life that's in the soil and
that<00:04:37.419> biological<00:04:38.419> life<00:04:38.599> is<00:04:38.780> actually

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
that biological life is actually

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
important to actually build structure so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.070 
important to actually build structure so
you'll<00:04:43.760> end<00:04:43.940> up<00:04:44.060> with<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.300> really<00:04:44.660> good

to<00:04:52.199> remember<00:04:52.350> is<00:04:52.860> look<00:04:53.370> after<00:04:53.820> your<00:04:53.940> soil<00:04:54.289> as

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
to remember is look after your soil as

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.439 
to remember is look after your soil as
it<00:04:55.470> feels<00:04:55.620> soil<00:04:56.039> is<00:04:56.310> well<00:04:56.639> looked<00:04:56.880> after<00:04:57.030> it

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
it feels soil is well looked after it

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.629 
it feels soil is well looked after it
will<00:04:57.570> look<00:04:57.750> after<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.190> way<00:04:59.340> we<00:04:59.490> look

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
will look after you and the way we look

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.650 
will look after you and the way we look
after<00:04:59.850> is<00:05:00.509> we<00:05:00.780> don't<00:05:01.080> touch<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:02.060> we<00:05:03.060> let<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.449> lie

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
after is we don't touch it we let it lie

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.129 
after is we don't touch it we let it lie
underneath<00:05:04.850> we<00:05:05.850> don't<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.240> dig<00:05:06.509> it<00:05:06.539> we<00:05:06.990> don't

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
underneath we don't you dig it we don't

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.010 
underneath we don't you dig it we don't
turn<00:05:07.530> it<00:05:07.800> we<00:05:08.310> want<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.729> retain<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.509> beautiful

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
turn it we want to retain that beautiful

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.320 
turn it we want to retain that beautiful
structure<00:05:10.440> so<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.830> could<00:05:11.009> hold<00:05:11.310> nutrients<00:05:12.120> and

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
structure so it could hold nutrients and

structure so it could hold nutrients and
pass<00:05:12.870> them<00:05:13.080> under<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.410> plans<00:05:13.680> they<00:05:14.250> can<00:05:14.400> hold

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
pass them under the plans they can hold

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.100 
pass them under the plans they can hold
water<00:05:15.860> so<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:17.070> number<00:05:18.030> one<00:05:18.180> rule<00:05:18.479> with<00:05:18.900> this

method is no digging the only way we
work<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.520> soil<00:05:23.759> is<00:05:24.270> we<00:05:24.570> add<00:05:24.750> layers<00:05:25.169> of

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
work the soil is we add layers of

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.180 
work the soil is we add layers of
compost<00:05:26.130> on<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:27.000> top<00:05:27.210> as<00:05:27.449> a<00:05:27.509> surface<00:05:28.470> mulch<00:05:28.740> on

protected on and keep that structure

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.420 
protected on and keep that structure
this<00:05:42.120> is<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> really<00:05:42.960> important<00:05:43.830> part<00:05:44.099> of<00:05:44.280> the

this is a really important part of the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.040 
this is a really important part of the
process<00:05:44.460> now<00:05:45.410> in<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.560> food<00:05:46.830> world<00:05:46.860> method

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
process now in the food world method

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.409 
process now in the food world method
we're<00:05:48.680> not<00:05:48.860> going<00:05:49.069> to<00:05:49.129> plant<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:49.699> rows<00:05:49.970> and

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
of plan to an area we're going to mostly

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.149 
of plan to an area we're going to mostly
just<00:05:56.300> mix<00:05:56.690> everything<00:05:56.990> up<00:05:57.470> there's<00:05:57.889> a<00:05:57.949> good

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
just mix everything up there's a good

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.969 
just mix everything up there's a good
reason<00:05:58.400> for<00:05:58.639> doing<00:05:58.879> this<00:05:59.030> firstly<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.680> gives

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
reason for doing this firstly it gives

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.649 
reason for doing this firstly it gives
you<00:06:01.099> much<00:06:01.460> better<00:06:01.789> pest<00:06:02.539> protection<00:06:03.520> now

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
you much better pest protection now

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.899 
you much better pest protection now
pests<00:06:05.659> who<00:06:05.930> eat<00:06:06.110> your<00:06:06.500> cross<00:06:06.909> usually

identify them by sight or smell now when
you've<00:06:12.020> got<00:06:12.169> everything<00:06:12.620> mixed<00:06:12.830> up<00:06:13.159> it<00:06:13.430> is

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
you've got everything mixed up it is

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.230 
you've got everything mixed up it is
very<00:06:14.150> hard<00:06:14.509> for<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:15.050> pest<00:06:15.409> to<00:06:16.069> actually<00:06:16.759> see

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
very hard for the pest to actually see

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.800 
very hard for the pest to actually see
the<00:06:18.050> specific<00:06:18.650> plan<00:06:19.009> that<00:06:19.310> they<00:06:19.430> like<00:06:19.699> it<00:06:20.479> just

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
the specific plan that they like it just

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.559 
the specific plan that they like it just
looks<00:06:20.990> like<00:06:21.080> a<00:06:21.199> jumbled<00:06:21.979> mess<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.699> it's

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
looks like a jumbled mess and it's

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.080 
looks like a jumbled mess and it's
impossible<00:06:24.199> for<00:06:24.229> them<00:06:24.379> to<00:06:24.440> smell<00:06:24.979> it<00:06:25.129> because

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
impossible for them to smell it because

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.879 
impossible for them to smell it because
there's<00:06:26.509> too<00:06:26.810> many<00:06:26.960> different<00:06:27.530> conflicting

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
there's too many different conflicting
