00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:10.010
 light horses on horse light distinguish 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:16.310
 following anatomical parts of the edge 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:19.220
 dorsal edge of the lungs blunt fit to 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 spine 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:30.289
 the ventral edge is sharp downward 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:35.719
 rib surface and surface 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.660
 adjacent to the ribs it is lateral 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 diaphragmatic surface adjacent to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.899
 the diaphragm that is directed caudally 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:53.719
 back surface between the lobes of the left and 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:58.340
 of the right lung is called between liva a 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:03.390
 surface between right and left lung 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.260
 called medium walls on adjacent to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.049
 shadow environment 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.869
 that is, on every lung she is with 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:16.220
 medial side on this surface 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:19.430
 eat into the pressure from the aorta esophagus and 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.470
 vena cava 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.650
 lung lobes 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:30.570
 on the left lung of the horse there are two 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.420
 share cranial she's on clinical 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.750
 apex and caudal terminology and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.320
 the average proportion observed in the lungs of others 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.329
 of animals 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:51.750
 there is no horse on the right lung of horse 3 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:55.250
 cranial lobes caudal and with 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 medial side on the right lung 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.750
 located additional share 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 also on the medial surface of each 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:16.810
 lung there are gates lung this place 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.810
 where the main bronchus enters the lung 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.990
 formed due to bifurcation then 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.140
 there is a division into 2 and trachea 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:33.070
 artery nerve and enters vein 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.730
 these components are the main bronchus 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.750
 the pulmonary artery is a nerve and vein is called 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.720
 the root 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.310
 lung i.e. lung gates enter 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.070
 lung root to the characteristics of the lung 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.000
 horses can be attributed lack 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.450
 additional bronchus which is present in 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.180
 cattle and pigs and 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:08.650
 sent to the right cranial u share 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:11.900
 in the horse he is missing dolce you drawing 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.350
 educated lung stroma on healthy 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.040
 light horse visible well but 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:23.380
 comparing with cattle and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.380
 pig smoothed enough
