00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.299
 let's now perform concepts 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.090
 anatomical and physiological on 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.380
 sexual 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.650
 it is the part of the central nervous system 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.270
 that is inside the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.140
 head let's perform now 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.420
 observe how the brain is inside 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.160
 of the skull first let's remove 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.980
 quickly the skin we have already prepared 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.170
 the model and we're left with a 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 skeleton we are going to retire too 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.250
 the eyes and we only stay with the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.960
 nervous system we want to observe how 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.809
 is the brain inside the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.430
 Skull fully protected by the table 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.880
 that is, the bones of the frontal skull 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 remember the frontal parietals the 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.890
 temporary 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 here is the fenoy des bones and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.760
 behind we have the occipital bone 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.430
 protecting the cranial cavity 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.410
 'lions of the brain correspond 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.729
 they call it the same as the bone that 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.729
 protect let's go now to remove the skull 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 of space to observe the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 nervous system 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.950
 it consists nervous we come back a bit 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.670
 let's look at the protection the space that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.570
 there is the cavity between the table 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.100
 bone and the skull there is a space 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.500
 considerable there in that space there 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.360
 are the membranes that cover the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 brain the mini images that are the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.619
 dura mater for one mother municipality the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.630
 rapporteur under the arrangement of himself 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.439
 find cerebrospinal fluid and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.869
 we also have bone a layer of 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.880
 compact double bone bone with something 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.250
 of bone and cosmos 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.469
 and now we are going to remove it completely 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.469
 let's remove it we even remove 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.299
 let's take our hands to observe 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.909
 the brain and observe a little less the 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.170
 structures ready 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.630
 there we are left with the brain 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.599
 the brain belongs to the brain 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 encephalus let's mention the 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.200
 structures that belong to the interval 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.540
 some first in one image 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.440
 two-dimensional and then we come back to this 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.190
 three-dimensional image 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.550
 in the national national image we have 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.840
 so that inside the brain we have 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.280
 the brain this is the brain in the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840
 brain 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.030
 well let's talk about all the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.490
 functions of the brain but let's 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.710
 summarize the here is where the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.410
 great processing of the nervous system 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.660
 if you enter the brain the integration 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.910
 of the information the processing the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.260
 ideas the personality is realized in the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.590
 brain 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.060
 we have other structures this 6 of 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.090
 encephalon that is formed by the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.550
 hospital the thalamus well hypothalamus 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.769
 the thalamus is a large area 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.170
 exchange between the brain of the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.180
 cortex in the brain and the rest of the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.849
 nervous system although it also has 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 some proper functions in hospital and 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.239
 in total the epi thalamo is related 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.650
 with control of the circadian rhythm 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.470
 while the hypothalamus is related 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.720
 with maintaining control of the system 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.879
 endocrine serves as a bridge between the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.860
 nervous system of the endocrine system and 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.260
 has important functions in the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.630
 control of emotions in control 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.090
 of many hormonal cycles both in 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.420
 men as in women other areas of 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.250
 Encephalon is the brain stem point 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.260
 in phallic conce has three parts is 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.560
 the phallus essence that is this part 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.430
 our portion 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.690
 the mesencephalon is this segment and here 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.720
 we see it well a medium brain 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.150
 mesencephalon then we have the bridge or 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.209
 protuberances and finally we have the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.430
 spinal bulb a white side is a 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.069
 site where all the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.890
 references and they also lower all 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.750
 references all the nerves that carry 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.180
 signals impulses towards the rest of the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.760
 story is not taking place as 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.200
 another organ of the cerebellum cerebellum 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.780
 who cerebral is a very organ 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.030
 important that is protected 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.889
 with occipital lobe at the base of the 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:26.580
 skull that helps us regulate 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.139
 movements to make these be from 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.740
 movements are coordinated 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.500
 coordinated and fine we have seen 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.940
 then 12 in the following videos 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.479
 let's see in detail each one of 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.479
 these organs
