00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
like they were running the clock out for

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.230 
like they were running the clock out for
the<00:03:32.290> entire<00:03:32.620> second<00:03:33.100> half<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:33.550> Luis<00:03:33.910> Smith

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
the entire second half but Luis Smith

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.150 
the entire second half but Luis Smith
and<00:03:34.450> Allred<00:03:35.020> come<00:03:35.230> up<00:03:35.380> big<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.710> that<00:03:35.800> third

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and Allred come up big on that third

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.890 
and Allred come up big on that third
down<00:03:36.400> because<00:03:36.940> they're<00:03:37.060> often<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.570> chance

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
down because they're often to the chance

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.710 
down because they're often to the chance
put<00:03:38.110> your<00:03:38.290> d80<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:39.820> that<00:03:40.000> momentum<00:03:40.390> does<00:03:40.540> not

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
put your d80 then that momentum does not

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.300 
put your d80 then that momentum does not
carry<00:03:41.050> over<00:03:41.140> for<00:03:41.530> them<00:03:41.650> even<00:03:41.950> with<00:03:42.160> the
