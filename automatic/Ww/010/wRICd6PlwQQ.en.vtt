00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530 
fingers together the thumb just kind of

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.590 
fingers together the thumb just kind of
hangs<00:00:18.740> out<00:00:18.950> at<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:19.130> side<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:20.330> you're<00:00:20.510> going

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
to tilt the backs of the hands towards

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.510 
to tilt the backs of the hands towards
each<00:00:22.760> other<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.450> then<00:00:24.050> flip<00:00:24.260> it<00:00:24.320> over<00:00:24.590> bring

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
each other and then flip it over bring

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.380 
each other and then flip it over bring
the<00:00:25.640> bumps<00:00:26.000> up<00:00:26.529> no<00:00:27.529> loop<00:00:27.800> sits<00:00:28.430> down<00:00:28.790> into<00:00:29.360> a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
the bumps up no loop sits down into a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:41.680 
the bumps up no loop sits down into a
loop<00:00:29.750> up<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:31.099> move<00:00:31.340> in<00:00:33.400> out<00:00:36.940> wow<00:00:40.210> wow<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:41.510> each
