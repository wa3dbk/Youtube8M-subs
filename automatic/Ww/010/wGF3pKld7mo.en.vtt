00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 do not 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.760
 since we are in a new tutorial of 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.340
 minecraft on this occasion what I 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.380
 I bring is an automatic dressing to the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.089
 pair of an emergency exit as 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.259
 I mean you already know that I have 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.820
 several walkthrough tutorials 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.220
 automatic in the channel but none 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 like this one is the truth that I love 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.910
 and I plan to build it my survival world 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.650
 I have to say that the design is world 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 jumbo but I have improved it and I have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 simplified this is the subtraction though 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 it takes just takes it and remains 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.629
 how will it work, it's very easy 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 look here is my exit sign for 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.210
 emergency and I'll put in game or of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 zero for example so you can see what 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 I can do in survival imagine 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.879
 that are attacking my house that comes in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.320
 musician that I just want to get out of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.640
 adventure quickly look I have not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 no armor type I shot by the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 hole and when I got down I appear 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 full diamond with a golden apple 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.890
 I'm going to eat there and there's a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.410
 Diamond sword 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.079
 I like this dressing room 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.670
 automatic and I'm going to put a creative that 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.199
 how it works so easy when I 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.059
 I throw myself through the hole I'm going to activate 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.040
 this rope that is in a court state 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.390
 of activation and it's going to make the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.619
 dispenser I tell myself that in the armors 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.050
 then fall she 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.340
 equipped is great I love ya 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.720
 I say the design is world and a bun 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 I have just improved it and it is 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.750
 simplified I will leave your channel the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 description of the video for you to see 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.040
 and nothing we pass to the constitution what 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.080
 first thing we have to do is our 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.810
 I floor our platform of our house 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.250
 where we want to build our 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.289
 automatic dressing 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.240
 we are looking for a center I want this one 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.420
 be my center where I take off my armor 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.830
 over power pink and flower then from this 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.930
 meaning I'm going to upload three blocks of 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.789
 height very well your boat that I blocked and 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.340
 eliminated the two blocks below there 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.440
 is now this block from the center 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.869
 play a cross around with what 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.479
 which placed a block on each side like this 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.369
 perfect now I put myself in the center 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.050
 this is going to be my roof is worth the clear 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.970
 I put myself in the center of my roof and 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.550
 touch place dispensers not 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.620
 dispensing welders on each side 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.450
 looking towards the center you see 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.980
 and I can already delete the center block 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.090
 this one from the roof eliminated it 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.550
 completely very well now I get 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.840
 looking towards my circuit like this and the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.210
 dispenser of the left and of the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.340
 right I put two blocks on top of 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.810
 each one so by dispensing from the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.970
 left of the right forgive me of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.460
 left two blocks and three above and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290
 now from the second block towards the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 right took one I'm going next to the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.800
 left of the second block towards the 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.840
 left he pulled another and eliminated these 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.820
 blocks here just left this floating 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.860
 to the right and this is floating to the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.350
 left now I'm going to need hooks 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.030
 I do not know if many people will know 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.190
 how they work but what it does is that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.070
 when I place two hooks and one 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.140
 string medium and passing through the medium 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.760
 he activates me and sends me a pulse of rectum 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.920
 so then when I fall I will 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.110
 just pass by here and he will send me a 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.910
 pulse to activate the cool dispense 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.420
 then a hook on each side and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.940
 one of rope in the middle look great 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.100
 I'm looking at the circuit from alante 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.870
 as always I have not moved it since 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.000
 now the hook on the right I have to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.310
 take out a block shaped staircase 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.260
 to the right and down 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 connect it with these dispenser from here and 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.520
 here you will see it rest a rest what 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.950
 you see this hook to the right and 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.569
 down and now I turn around and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.630
 I do the same thing on this side towards the 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.180
 right and down I put the rest a 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.250
 rest is worth it now I would need to place two 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.019
 dispenses more see where the arrest falls 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.930
 in position of falls is the rest there goes 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.930
 another dispenser plus I'll place it there and 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.480
 on the other side there is a total of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.280
 6 dispenser now just me 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.950
 I would make my roof to do my 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.989
 roof I have to look for the center I'm going to 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.819
 do the same thing I'm going to do the cross look 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.650
 and here I have the center see it and I do not 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.030
 I can paste this block below because 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.519
 is the hook so this block 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.190
 over the hook and I make my roof 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.660
 simply here is for now according to 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.340
 the time you have then it is to go 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.620
 more up to paris - you will make a roof more 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.420
 nice more cute like mine if you want 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.190
 you can cover all this, nothing happens 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.260
 so you can not see there is an example 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.330
 although that is the less compact version 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.190
 then I have made it more compact 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.660
 and it's very easy I'm going to teach you now 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.400
 that works perfectly I'm going to put 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.160
 here some caps I'm going to retaliate 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.230
 obviously let's see here I put some 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.970
 caps here I'm going to put some 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.560
 pants I say that I love that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.720
 I plan to build it in my survival yes or 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.780
 yes because I find it a low way 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.139
 super fun to leave adventure not 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.960
 you throw in there 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.580
 Needless to say, of course, of course 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.199
 Needless to say, what can you put in 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.270
 dispense what you want you do not have 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.099
 why put armor can throw yourself 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.749
 a peak a shovel there is a full armor 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.879
 iron and every time he said and I'm going to 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:42.069
 look at you throw here scoop shovel and full 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.979
 iron to see if you already equipped me all 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.680
 perfect voucher and down here in the center 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.689
 where it falls I recommend not to take it off 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.719
 no heart put a cube of water 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.539
 there and so when you fall you will fall with the 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.830
 armor in a safe area, I'll go 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.979
 to teach how it works again I 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.129
 I'm here lalala I'll tell you mine 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.210
 I shot more and good and one appeared 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.129
 golden apple and a sword but 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.770
 you can appear as I say full 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.389
 iron with pick and shovel I hope you have 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.949
 liked this video the truth that to me 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.300
 I love making videos so you can 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.590
 enjoy and you can learn more from 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.180
 rest although this one has not taken much 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.919
 but I already tell you that it is very useful if I 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.960
 I think that building what has 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.120
 liked like favorites subscribe
