00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.470 
do it is alright the basic premise is to
get<00:01:55.830> your<00:01:56.010> runners<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.940> opposition's

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
get your runners to the opposition's

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.000 
get your runners to the opposition's
home<00:01:57.840> base<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.440> they're<00:01:58.590> trying<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.860> get

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
home base and they're trying to get

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.160 
home base and they're trying to get
their<00:01:59.070> runners<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.730> your<00:01:59.760> home<00:01:59.970> base<00:02:00.120> and<00:02:00.390> for

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
their runners to your home base and for

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.650 
their runners to your home base and for
each<00:02:01.320> run<00:02:01.800> on<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.040> gets<00:02:02.280> into<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.300> base<00:02:03.450> i

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
each run on it gets into the base i

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.040 
each run on it gets into the base i
think<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> lose<00:02:04.080> one<00:02:04.320> life<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:06.450> only<00:02:06.570> start

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
think you lose one life you only start

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.530 
think you lose one life you only start
the<00:02:07.200> match<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.740> 10<00:02:08.220> lives<00:02:08.490> so<00:02:09.300> you're<00:02:09.450> going

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
the match with 10 lives so you're going

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.710 
the match with 10 lives so you're going
to<00:02:09.600> be<00:02:09.690> kind<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.990> careful<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.940> those<00:02:12.420> little

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
to be kind of careful so those little

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.240 
to be kind of careful so those little
blue<00:02:12.840> squares<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.320> where<00:02:13.470> i<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.710> place<00:02:13.920> my

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
blue squares is where i can place my

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.140 
blue squares is where i can place my
defensive<00:02:15.000> or<00:02:15.540> attacking<00:02:16.140> units<00:02:16.940> there's<00:02:17.940> six

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
different types to choose from the ball

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.530 
different types to choose from the ball
but<00:02:20.340> their<00:02:20.460> own<00:02:20.580> little<00:02:20.760> strengths<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
weaknesses and there should be caught

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.120 
weaknesses and there should be caught
they<00:02:24.960> should<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.170> positioned<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.860> map

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
they should be positioned on the map

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.680 
they should be positioned on the map
according<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> weapons<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.390> like

have mortars there's like a freeze ray

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.290 
have mortars there's like a freeze ray
well<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.980> slows<00:02:35.430> down<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.820> enemy's<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.209> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
well it slows down the enemy's to the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.530 
well it slows down the enemy's to the
other<00:02:36.390> guys<00:02:36.600> can<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.900> more<00:02:37.080> shots<00:02:38.540> it's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
other guys can get more shots it's

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
other guys can get more shots it's
really<00:02:39.750> quite<00:02:39.900> challenging<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.709> single

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
really quite challenging in single

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.030 
really quite challenging in single
player<00:02:41.720> against<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.810> AI<00:02:42.930> i'd<00:02:43.320> really<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:43.980> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
player against the AI i'd really like to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.880 
player against the AI i'd really like to
see<00:02:44.310> how<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.520> plays<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.390> online<00:02:45.660> against<00:02:46.320> a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890

friend I'm just I didn't want to go into
the<00:02:50.760> public<00:02:51.360> multiplayer<00:02:52.050> servers<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.650> thought

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the public multiplayer servers I thought

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.260 
the public multiplayer servers I thought
there's<00:02:53.340> probably<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.820> be<00:02:53.880> some<00:02:54.060> guys

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
there's probably going to be some guys

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.570 
there's probably going to be some guys
had<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> since<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.959> initial<00:02:55.110> alpha<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:56.370> just

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
had it since the initial alpha it's just

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.220 
had it since the initial alpha it's just
incredible<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.480> we'll<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.810> eat<00:02:58.020> me

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
incredible at it and we'll just eat me

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.560 
incredible at it and we'll just eat me
alive<00:02:59.030> although<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.270> could<00:03:00.330> have<00:03:00.450> been<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
alive although that could have been a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.900 
alive although that could have been a
good<00:03:00.720> video<00:03:00.870> actually<00:03:01.610> maybe<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.730> should<00:03:02.880> just

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
good video actually maybe I should just

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.940 
good video actually maybe I should just
man<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.330> next<00:03:03.600> time<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:03.959> that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.720 

alright<00:03:07.950> well<00:03:08.129> I've<00:03:08.310> got<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.549> keep<00:03:08.670> this

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
alright well I've got to keep this

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.960 
alright well I've got to keep this
fairly<00:03:09.060> brief<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.349> hope<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.739> short<00:03:11.069> look

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
fairly brief so I hope this short look

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.380 
fairly brief so I hope this short look
at<00:03:12.150> cumin<00:03:12.750> spiked<00:03:13.260> or<00:03:13.379> interest<00:03:14.239> its<00:03:15.239> twenty

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
at cumin spiked or interest its twenty

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.059 
at cumin spiked or interest its twenty
five<00:03:15.629> percent<00:03:15.659> off<00:03:15.959> at<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.140> moment<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.709> if
