00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.430
 NASA assures that it is likely that 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.049
 mars there was water 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.670
 This data has been known for very 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.679
 few hours in a report on the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.900
 data collection that the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.360
 curiosity explorer on the surface 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.180
 of the red planet the scientist of the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.970
 nasa john grotzinger said the photos 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 recent you have sent the curiosity 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.070
 show what makes them think they were 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.980
 water streams so no 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.260
 discard that on Mars there will ever be 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 existed life you what do you say sea ​​and bouquets 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 our companion mari accompanies us 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.980
 branches to tell us more about these 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.640
 data revealed by NASA this time 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.219
 I called them in hot story over 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.679
 of the goals that nasa has is to find 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 life on other planets and in this case 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.789
 we are talking about the planet Mars is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 a very very interesting story and what 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 what I like most is like the things that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.089
 we learn here on earth they help us 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.530
 to discover things on other planets 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.870
 let's start first by talking about 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 geology what do you think look at me I love 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.530
 this first images of the earth and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.880
 let's talk about the fans 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.579
 fluvial and that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 let's go here to the desert of 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.840
 california before was one of the places 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 the world's driest and hottest 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.170
 well there you can appreciate in those 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.130
 mountains that surface in between 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.829
 the mountains 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.579
 this is what you see there is the fan 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.360
 river 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.789
 those are old streams that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.210
 they moved along that area and they bring 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.950
 sediment is formed when this water that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.689
 moves quickly deposits the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.610
 sediment when bone elevation drops 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.740
 at the foot of the mountain at the foot of the mountain 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.810
 of the mountain and extends as a fan 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.459
 well we know that it happens that in 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.349
 the earth we pass to Mars because 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.819
 I want to show you the mars 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.280
 google sea you knew there was a google 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.799
 maps look no I did not know we've arrived 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 so far and there is a google mars and here is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.110
 precisely the crater where or very close 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 where he arrived on the rover Curiosity 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.740
 you can see there marked with that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.299
 banderita good with what is called the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.009
 that's why they chose this 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.259
 place there is also a fan 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.450
 fluvial you can see that law that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.610
 form there under the white bar 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.950
 that is are the channels 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.110
 of ancient rivers there you can see their 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.930
 water channels and that's the fan 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.610
 fluvial what is believed and that can be 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.650
 appreciate in the upcoming images of the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.500
 stones is that the stones that have been 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.810
 hauled through those old 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.140
 water channels and makes the fan 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.630
 fluvial we go to the stones of Mars 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.940
 let's go to the same one there you can see 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.670
 they look like river stones see how they are 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.800
 pretty smooth then what do they think 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 before they could not be appreciated so close 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.280
 because there was no one on Mars that 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.080
 I could take pictures but now the clergy 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.910
 already it is given you these data have 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.790
 analyzed and that's why they think that 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.860
 yes there was water that ran fast 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.080
 a strong enough water current 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.180
 appointment that moved there and that here 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.370
 up these stones and that the alder or 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.250
 be that the water was running there 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.610
 for quite some time and believe that I could 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.010
 measure between a one depth 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.989
 about half a meter so 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.820
 quite interesting have you left me with 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.130
 my mouth wide open my dear sea and because 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.290
 I find it very interesting and I also 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.950
 I think because we are the only ones in the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.599
 universe 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.629
 what they are trying to see is that they 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.050
 you can find some microscopes from 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.459
 evidence and cross 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.650
 Well let's wait for the next releases 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.930
 of the nasa on this matter thanks my 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.230
 darling of the sea and see you soon class 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.230
 filthy
