manifold and we just kind of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
manifold and we just kind of
disconnected<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.790> bit<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.510> of

is with these particular alternators is
you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.149> getting<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.809> belt<00:00:52.170> tensioner

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you know getting in here belt tensioner

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.790 
you know getting in here belt tensioner
people<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.520> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> scared<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.239> belts

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
easy this is your belt tensioner it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.929 
easy this is your belt tensioner it's
spring-loaded<00:01:04.129> basically<00:01:05.129> use<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> 1/2<00:01:05.729> inch

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
spring-loaded basically use a 1/2 inch

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.230 
spring-loaded basically use a 1/2 inch
ratchet<00:01:07.220> once<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.549> half<00:01:08.670> inch<00:01:08.909> here

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
ratchet once you get your half inch here

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.590 
ratchet once you get your half inch here
I<00:01:09.390> use<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> 25<00:01:10.890> inch<00:01:11.159> breaker<00:01:11.520> bar<00:01:11.820> basically

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I use the 25 inch breaker bar basically

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.530 
I use the 25 inch breaker bar basically
moved<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.909> releases<00:01:15.390> all

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
moved it to the right that releases all

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.170 
moved it to the right that releases all
the<00:01:15.720> tension<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> belt<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.880> bill

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

the tension on the belt this bill
basically<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.290> enough<00:01:19.560> slack<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> just

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
basically has enough slack you can just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.880 
basically has enough slack you can just
slide<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> over<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:22.229> people<00:01:22.439> talking

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
tension bar back in and then apply my

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.450 
tension bar back in and then apply my
belt<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> simple<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:46.979> easy<00:01:47.130> part

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
or the alternator was nice lined up

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.660 
or the alternator was nice lined up
correctly<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.530> reattached<00:03:11.890> all<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.550> my

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
correctly then I reattached all of my

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
wires I came here to the belt with the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.560 
wires I came here to the belt with the
1/2<00:03:18.610> inch<00:03:18.880> ratchet<00:03:19.120> bar<00:03:19.480> again<00:03:19.780> it<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:21.570> this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
1/2 inch ratchet bar again it is this

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.520 
1/2 inch ratchet bar again it is this
piece<00:03:22.840> right<00:03:23.080> here<00:03:23.250> okay<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:26.020> where<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
piece right here okay that is where the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.960 
piece right here okay that is where the
ratchet<00:03:26.980> fits<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:29.250> again<00:03:30.250> by<00:03:30.400> moving<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.820> to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
ratchet fits in again by moving it to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.990 
ratchet fits in again by moving it to
the<00:03:31.000> right<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.600> will<00:03:32.260> allow<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:33.250> belt<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.880> be

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
the right it will allow that belt to be

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.070 
the right it will allow that belt to be
slid<00:03:34.390> up<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:34.750> over<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:36.130> here<00:03:36.900> now<00:03:37.900> I've

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
slid up and over this here now I've

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.770 
slid up and over this here now I've
noticed<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:39.430> 5.4<00:03:40.300> apparently

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
noticed that on the 5.4 apparently

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.970 
noticed that on the 5.4 apparently
there's<00:03:40.989> two<00:03:41.260> types<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:43.560> grooves<00:03:44.560> there's<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
there's two types of grooves there's a

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.590 
there's two types of grooves there's a
six<00:03:45.280> groove<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:45.790> an<00:03:45.880> eight<00:03:46.030> groove<00:03:46.330> this

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
six groove and an eight groove this

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.120 
six groove and an eight groove this
happens<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.050> be<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.410> groove<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:47.950> make<00:03:48.100> sure

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
happens to be in a groove so make sure

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.130 
happens to be in a groove so make sure
you<00:03:48.430> get<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> right<00:03:49.150> alternator<00:03:49.690> when<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.020> do

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
you get the right alternator when you do

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.720 
you get the right alternator when you do
that<00:03:50.970> other<00:03:51.970> than<00:03:52.209> that<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:53.430> simple<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.520> easy

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
that other than that of simple and easy

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.030 
that other than that of simple and easy
after<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.690> get<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.200> done<00:03:56.440> everything

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
after you get all that done everything

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.530 
after you get all that done everything
looks<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.370> be<00:03:57.459> correct<00:03:57.940> you're<00:03:58.150> going<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.360> want

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
looks to be correct you're going to want

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.180 
looks to be correct you're going to want
to<00:03:58.600> reconnect<00:03:59.140> your<00:03:59.380> negative<00:04:00.070> battery
