 su-8 obviously goes to ram 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.860

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.069
 we will never know 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.450
 and the story that sometimes patriotism 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.049
 happens out of place told us the days of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.379

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.650
 with the second goes no better than dad lit up 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.950

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.140
 t25 loses his head in it start to play 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.180

 smoking frame ru 251 continue 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.799
 take damage and finally does explode 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.799
 although 100 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.360

 Spartans climb into one tank but precisely 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.110
 so apparently from happened at the moment 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.289
 u have 4 frags and the score continues 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.289
