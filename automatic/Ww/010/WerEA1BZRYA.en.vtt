the<00:00:47.339> free<00:00:47.670> styling<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.449> photography<00:00:49.579> firstly

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the free styling of photography firstly

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.310 
the free styling of photography firstly
you<00:00:50.640> let's<00:00:50.850> start<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.480> explaining<00:00:51.839> how<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you let's start by explaining how it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.979 
you let's start by explaining how it
usually<00:00:52.620> works<00:00:53.040> with<00:00:53.370> photography<00:00:54.269> there<00:00:54.839> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
usually works with photography there is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.030 
usually works with photography there is
a<00:00:55.019> plane<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> focus

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
a plane of focus

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.979 
a plane of focus
you've<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:56.940> lens<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.539> centre

you've got your lens and your centre
here<00:00:58.140> usually<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.129> plane<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.430> focus<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.940> power

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
here usually the plane of focus is power

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.959 
here usually the plane of focus is power
low<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.899> lens<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> sensor<00:01:02.010> geeky<00:01:02.910> stuff

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
low the lens and the sensor geeky stuff

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.540 
low the lens and the sensor geeky stuff
but<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> lensing<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.039> to<00:01:05.160> mess<00:01:05.369> with

but if we lensing you get to mess with

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.520 
but if we lensing you get to mess with
that<00:01:05.610> plane<00:01:05.940> like<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.539> rich<00:01:06.869> guy<00:01:07.140> who<00:01:07.170> likes

that plane like some rich guy who likes
messing<00:01:07.979> about<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.399> planes<00:01:08.759> and<00:01:09.840> like

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
messing about with planes and like

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
isn't it and dust and stuff like that

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.500 
isn't it and dust and stuff like that
now<00:02:19.950> actually<00:02:20.520> when<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.300> it's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
now actually when you think of it it's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.830 
now actually when you think of it it's
just<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.019> tilt<00:02:22.410> shift<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.120> tilt<00:02:24.540> lens

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
just like a tilt shift you can tilt lens

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.140 
just like a tilt shift you can tilt lens
after<00:02:25.319> all<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.110> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
after all just like that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.119 
after all just like that
that<00:02:29.780> means<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.080> don't<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:30.409> pay<00:02:30.560> those

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
that means you don't have to pay those

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.539 
that means you don't have to pay those
extremely<00:02:31.819> expensive<00:02:32.450> like<00:02:33.349> second-hand<00:02:34.250> car

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
extremely expensive like second-hand car

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.470 
extremely expensive like second-hand car
kind<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.360> prices<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.650> fugly<00:02:37.010> lens<00:02:37.480> with

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
kind of prices for fugly lens with

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
kind of prices for fugly lens with
hinges<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.970> if<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.180> do<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:42.440> you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
hinges on it if you just do this so you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.869 
hinges on it if you just do this so you
could<00:02:42.860> make<00:02:43.040> some<00:02:43.250> lovely<00:02:43.459> tilt-shift

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
could make some lovely tilt-shift

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.850 
could make some lovely tilt-shift
miniatures<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.659> free<00:02:44.840> lensing<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:45.739> you're

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
miniatures with free lensing but you're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.860 
miniatures with free lensing but you're
stuck<00:02:46.220> indoors<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:46.879> you<00:02:47.000> must<00:02:47.269> make<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.840> and

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
face I can get my our focus as I mean

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:06.819 
face I can get my our focus as I mean
she'll<00:02:54.560> talk<00:02:54.769> less<00:03:02.590> Oh<00:03:03.590> calm<00:03:04.579> down<00:03:05.799> let<00:03:06.799> me

she'll talk less Oh calm down let me

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.580 
she'll talk less Oh calm down let me
take<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.099> shot<00:03:07.400> with<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:08.150> F<00:03:08.629> one-point-four

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
take a shot with just F one-point-four

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.039 
take a shot with just F one-point-four
first<00:03:09.890> let<00:03:10.609> me<00:03:10.640> show<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.030> trying<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.900> get

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
first let me show you trying to get

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.569 
first let me show you trying to get
shallow<00:03:12.290> depth-of-field<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:13.010> kind<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.310> hard

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
shallow depth-of-field is kind of hard

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.860 
shallow depth-of-field is kind of hard
when<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:13.970> scene<00:03:14.180> doesn't<00:03:14.390> have<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.659> lot<00:03:14.840> of

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
when you scene doesn't have a lot of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.720 
when you scene doesn't have a lot of
depth<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:15.799> when<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.040> can<00:03:16.190> douche<00:03:16.430> up<00:03:16.609> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
depth but when you can douche up the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.309 
depth but when you can douche up the
plane<00:03:16.909> of<00:03:17.090> focus<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.780> get<00:03:17.900> some<00:03:18.079> crazy

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
plane of focus you can get some crazy

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.670 
plane of focus you can get some crazy
ball<00:03:18.829> kick<00:03:19.099> by<00:03:19.519> tilting<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.060> plane<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.420> focus

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
ball kick by tilting the plane of focus

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.440 
ball kick by tilting the plane of focus
so<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.040> only<00:03:22.190> get<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.640> much<00:03:22.790> depth<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.269> field

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
so you only get so much depth of field

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.119 
so you only get so much depth of field
with<00:03:23.629> that<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.209> still<00:03:26.420> see<00:03:26.629> a<00:03:26.659> lot<00:03:26.870> of

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
with that but you can still see a lot of

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.830 
with that but you can still see a lot of
unwanted<00:03:28.129> stuff<00:03:28.579> let's<00:03:29.090> get<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:29.359> even<00:03:29.720> more

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
unwanted stuff let's get this even more

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.069 
unwanted stuff let's get this even more
blurry<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.340> by<00:03:31.519> taking<00:03:31.730> off<00:03:32.380> your<00:03:33.380> lens<00:03:33.560> oh

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
blurry do it by taking off your lens oh

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:46.330 
blurry do it by taking off your lens oh
look<00:03:36.079> at<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.730> yeah<00:03:44.739> now<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.069> think<00:03:46.220> about

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
look at that yeah now if you think about

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.330 
look at that yeah now if you think about
the<00:03:46.579> plane<00:03:46.760> of<00:03:46.910> focus<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.769> parallel<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:49.040> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the plane of focus it's parallel to the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.930 
the plane of focus it's parallel to the
lens<00:03:50.919> so<00:03:51.919> if<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.069> imagine<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.459> plate<00:03:52.669> on<00:03:52.879> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
lens so if you imagine a plate on the

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.289 
lens so if you imagine a plate on the
face<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.769> normal<00:03:55.069> plane<00:03:55.280> focus<00:03:55.819> there

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
face just the normal plane focus there

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.819 
face just the normal plane focus there
you<00:03:56.359> go<00:03:56.480> that's<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.750> plate<00:03:56.989> of<00:03:57.169> focus

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
you go that's a plate of focus

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.460 
you go that's a plate of focus
imagine<00:03:58.579> a<00:03:58.639> plate<00:03:58.849> of<00:03:59.000> focus<00:03:59.389> it's<00:04:00.199> usually

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
imagine a plate of focus it's usually

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.830 
imagine a plate of focus it's usually
right<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:01.010> if<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.120> tilt<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.389> lens<00:04:02.629> like

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
right that if you tilt the lens like

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.970 
right that if you tilt the lens like
that<00:04:03.049> the<00:04:03.889> plane<00:04:04.099> of<00:04:04.250> focus<00:04:04.280> goes<00:04:04.790> like<00:04:04.970> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
that the plane of focus goes like that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.500 
that the plane of focus goes like that
the<00:04:06.980> other<00:04:07.129> way<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.000> plate

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the other way the plate

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.039 
the other way the plate
plane<00:04:09.099> goes<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.310> way<00:04:10.459> there<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.150> an<00:04:11.359> inherent

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
plane goes that way there is an inherent

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.809 
plane goes that way there is an inherent
problem<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.500> having<00:04:12.620> lens<00:04:13.010> millimeters<00:04:13.699> away

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
problem of having lens millimeters away

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.550 
problem of having lens millimeters away
from<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.209> camera<00:04:14.629> though<00:04:14.840> but<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.319> further

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
from the camera though but the further

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.879 
from the camera though but the further
fo<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.489> take<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.849> lens<00:04:17.000> away<00:04:17.329> more<00:04:18.229> macro<00:04:18.739> it

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
fo you take the lens away more macro it

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.050 
fo you take the lens away more macro it
becomes<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.329> have<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.479> get<00:04:20.630> really<00:04:20.720> close

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
becomes so you have to get really close

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.450 
becomes so you have to get really close

I<00:04:25.490> mean<00:04:26.949> forget<00:04:27.949> just<00:04:28.880> saying<00:04:29.150> if

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
I mean forget just saying if

I<00:04:36.820> mean<00:04:37.820> don't<00:04:37.940> think<00:04:38.210> it's<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.600> easy<00:04:39.460> now

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.350 
getting white pose as well I mean me you
