 they have a huge range of colors 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.620
 texture ends and therefore absolutely i 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.620

 creamy texture estimates very much 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.330

 in my opinion on many complexions 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.910

 price from the woman and it is a color 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.160
 always very neutral, slightly pink 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.160

 and it is this coral peach color really 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.070
 fantastic for the summer above all is a 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.990
 really very very beautiful color has 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.490
 a slightly born texture 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.550
 therefore also gives a lot of brightness to the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.830
 skin becomes dull and then it goes to 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.290
 apply the gloss and pre-scratch it 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.340
 because in a fairly dry state 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.890
 8 your favorite red lipstick mine 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.680
 favorite place was ruby ​​vd mark that is 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.620
 this matte lipstick 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.379
 but really but it is very very opaque 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.430
 so he writes a lot I like it 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.200
 I love this color because it's so matt 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.760
 very dry which seems almost just 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.819
 on the lips it really is a color 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.450
 very full it lasts a lot only with 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:46.130
 even without a pencil you really like it 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.130
 so also the color has a big heat 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.290
 9 your hatred of the favorite then the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:59.300
 my favorite purple and cyber lipstick of

 max that these very dark bear and 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.240
 this is a satèn even though it looks like 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.160
 amplified texture so it's always 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.940
 quite closed it is also beautiful 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.650
 color intensity 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.710
 10 your favorite fuchsia lipstick 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.570
 then I adore this lancom here 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.570
 number 332 which is a fuchsia lipstick a 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.920
 color is fantastic it is fabulous at one 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.750
 beautiful writing is not very dry 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.960
 so he does n't know how to hang bra, it's hard too 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.960
 quite 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.330
 I don't have your favorite orange lipstick 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.610
 so many rest is carancho but I like it 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.940
 very much this here that the number a 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:51.210
 604 of kiko which is a very full color 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.900
 superfluous perfect for summer 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.210
 I don't know if the light really makes it anyway 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.520
 a fabulous color and this is part 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.310
 of the velvet line must therefore a color 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.669
 even to a free fixing mine 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.669
 on the lips 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.690
 12 your favorite unusual lipstick 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.390
 I bought it from the cocktail site 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.560
 cosmetics long ago and is a line clown e 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:20.080
 a lot of her mark because lipsticks 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:25.480
 the scent is practically identical 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.490
 also draws the form also and the color 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.230
 a species is really very particular 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.730
 of beautiful lilac gray then also a 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.370
 couple gen.ca nino is kind of 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:40.360
 bullet just like those of max ea 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.270
 on printed a holographic unicorn ed 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.370
 he was very cute 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.710
 13 your favorite dark lipstick 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.860
 then the darker but absolute lipstick 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.960
 that I have and this qualifies that it is in way 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.710
 523 and is black 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.890
 I like it a lot because it is one of the few 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.900
 black lipsticks that are really nothing 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.520
 because others often do not 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.060
 write well it was really 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.060
 intense 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.099
 fourteenth question texture finish 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.229
 favorite then as I told you before 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:20.090
 a texture that I really like 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.710
 el amplified by macro but generally all 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.120
 the creamy effects then those that 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.580
 I'm pretty much on the level of 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.999
 writing but at the same time I am 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.449
 quite creamy comfortable on 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.210
 lips 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:36.560
 what is the texture I prefer others 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:40.039
 la7 favorites generally you like i 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.539
 pencils this of kiko because the 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.219
 I recommend because they are if they don't have much 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.259
 practical to always keep in your bag 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.789
 scope remains above all more colors 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.219
 even letters without letters 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:54.110
 mirror make some cocoa butter and 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:55.819
 then these here as that of scenario 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.650
 that made you see before they are the 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.779
 double lipsticks those you have from a 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:03.110
 side the liquid lipstick then effect 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:04.639
 matte velvet as if it will pass print 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.879
 attention lips and has done so much 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.560
 instead moisturizing which therefore allows to 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.960
 soften and no such weapons and 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.550
