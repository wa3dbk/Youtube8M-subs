00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
 photographing children as a business 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.080
 I have already spent twenty times in different 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 cities and even in tel aviv traveled with him 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.969
 but why new because strongly 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.550
 reworked the program now it's two days 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.520
 six hours but not clearly divided by 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.340
 topics day 1 will be interesting photographer 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.029
 and those who want to become a photographer because 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.039
 what is this day 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 about how to move the market for children 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.910
 photos of the nursery, I will do 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 the focus is on child photography not 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.219
 family 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 how is it different now in brief 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 tell the family photographer a lot 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.090
 big competition 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.460
 and we still have kindergartens territory 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 where parents don't let children all that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.350
 going on there will forget and this is the language of memory 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.469
 will leave forever and here and a shoot on 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.149
 in fact there is a lot there 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.699
 interaction of children friendship and communication 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.590
 creativity game in all this baby 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.480
 brewed show a bunch of emotions need it 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.899
 be sure to leave this children's story 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 photos videos make a 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.920
 photographers what they do think 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.020
 take off the vignettes virtual suits 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 why because it is a pipeline survey 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.080
 it is more profitable it is well from their point of view 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.570
 more profitable 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 I'm persuading you that it is not so 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.350
 In fact at this seminar you exactly 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.689
 Believe in the fact that live children's photography 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.420
 reporting here such a game she 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.400
 really in demand it is sold otherwise 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.340
 how would I take off 1100 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.280
 170 photo shoots in six years of their work 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.009
 and is still in demand now 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.689
 I order almost every day in spring 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.229
 generally will not go away from these 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 customers are simply overwhelmed with orders and 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.490
 urgent growth schemes to graph children in 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.170
 kindergarten and of course the main 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.030
 focus on this workshop i will give on 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.619
 holding a photo shoot in 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.799
 kindergartens and in those nurseries 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.670
 institutions where parents are not and where 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.000
 there is a real children's story first 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.770
 day 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.759
 about how to unwind to move 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.680
 advertise very little because 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.300
 they themselves advertise I believe that there is 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.160
 free ways to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.300
 movement is, well, first of all pr taki 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.900
 This is the pr of the way and the creation of word of mouth 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.240
 when the customer notice is promoted and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.490
 of course there will be a painful question 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.110
 which just photographers always want 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.270
 learn and always with me pulls this 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 information right here we start with the first 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.740
 minutes of the workshop ask these questions this 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.970
 how to sell these photos tricks 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.100
 sales how best to sell by the hour 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.620
 packs by the piece sell photos 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.020
 support options 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 actually touch a little photobanks 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.310
 and some such things that 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.900
 principle you can find without me in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.560
 on the internet but still i will share my experience 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.780
 their work in this in these areas 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:01.050
 this is a proven experience the second day is 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.550
 day for parents and for photographers if 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.500
 someone not a photographer can just 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.430
 taking pictures of my children is going 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.990
 become a parent 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.690
 he will also be interested in this day 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.270
 because the day is about how to communicate the game 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.340
 with children while taking pictures as 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.440
 do it all together why do it 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.390
 together because children don't need 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.640
 photos they are not customers customers 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.930
 are they parents or some adults 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.560
 people children are people who want 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.959
 have fun playing chat with you 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.970
 enjoy the process here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.670
 this day is about how interesting this is for 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.660
 children process create and just create 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.760
 so that as a result 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.500
 It turned out a lot many many photos 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 who will buy from you and not only 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.840
 photos there is another photo product 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.190
 there books something else talk about it 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.020
 plus we will consider 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.850
 emergency situations that happen on 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.610
 filming but adults sometimes we 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.489
 some feints fox throw out too 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.370
 I will tell about the experience of the decision of these 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.989
 situations about some important things that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.290
 must be considered in carrying these photos 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.780
 sessions also touch painful 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.180
 questions how to photograph technically 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.880
 that is how to light how to work 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.230
 colored rooms with black walls and 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.300
 ceilings of the next chamber 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.060
 how to photograph children's holidays 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.830
 how to photograph children in the family what 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.420
 do the background well then there are such 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.120
 technical and artistic moments 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.830
 which we will have to decide too but 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.470
 The main thing of course chip is still 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.360
 structure of this day because if 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.240
 before it was such a story 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.490
 about everything now it is a clear structure 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.010
 here if you go here there is a page 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.380
 below the bottom of the roller we are there detailed 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.470
 seminar programs you will see that the second 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.810
 the day is just a little sign and 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.580
 there are painted the age of the children that is for 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.070
 the basis is taken children's periodization 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.600
 child's mental development 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.760
 listed age we will be 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.540
 work this babies 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.270
 kids from year to three are preschoolers 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.340
 it is junior high school students and young people well 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.600
 talk a little bit about adult photography 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.270
 and on top there will be written features 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.760
 age problems age some 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.780
 psychological nuances are positive on what we 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.590
 we can work at this age 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.600
 features how we can solve 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.410
 problems of this age we still have 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.690
 transition periods are crisis yes when we 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.220
 we can the greatest problem number 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.100
 problems get on the shoot and also have 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.840
 shooting conditions ie every age 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.760
 can be shot in different conditions and 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.960
 get the best result with 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.000
 least effort 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.920
 the best result with the least 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.480
 This effort is important to read because 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.720
 the photographer must result from all this 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:54.340
 survive have fun and really 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.390
 Well, as Henry Ford said, let's 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.340
 you turn our hobby into 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.640
 high paying profession the words henry

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.340
 taking pictures of living children and creating 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.650
 emotional portraits show a little 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.449
 as 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.400
 prevent children from bringing their feelings because 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.040
 that they will be in a very crisis 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.490
 situations will lead them instead of where 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.550
 unfamiliar territory is not a shock I 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.440
 I know it there at 20 great photographers

 scare but we will try to bring in 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.820
 feeling and make sure they don't 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.310
 They wanted to leave us. 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.490

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.710
