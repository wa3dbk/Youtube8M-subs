00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
are lifting what will happen there is

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920 
are lifting what will happen there is
that<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.340> skin<00:03:23.640> will<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.360> snow<00:03:24.629> will<00:03:24.810> get

under the skin and start to break the
skin<00:03:27.569> away<00:03:27.840> from<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> scheme<00:03:28.500> potentially

the<00:03:29.250> whole<00:03:29.430> skin<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:30.060> come<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.080> little

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
the whole skin can come on so a little

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.050 
the whole skin can come on so a little
bit<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.470> time<00:03:31.739> spent<00:03:32.160> there<00:03:32.220> just<00:03:32.730> smoothing

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
bit of time spent there just smoothing

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:42.520 
bit of time spent there just smoothing
that<00:03:33.299> on<00:03:35.599> much<00:03:36.599> less<00:03:36.840> like<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.290> lose<00:03:37.440> your<00:03:37.500> skin

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.199 

in<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.829> clip<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.129> can<00:03:44.370> see<00:03:44.430> two<00:03:44.879> different

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
in this clip you can see two different

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.449 
in this clip you can see two different
types<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.750> skinning<00:03:46.140> technique<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.430> first

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
types of skinning technique the first

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.509 
types of skinning technique the first
skiers<00:03:48.090> lifting<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.750> ski<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.379> ski<00:03:50.160> normally

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
skiers lifting the ski a ski normally

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.089 
skiers lifting the ski a ski normally
way<00:03:50.670> versus<00:03:51.239> kilos<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.019> beat<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.829> over<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
way versus kilos of the beat so over the

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.530 
way versus kilos of the beat so over the
course<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.549> day<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.879> are<00:03:53.940> lifting<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.420> lot

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
course of the day you are lifting a lot

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.390 
course of the day you are lifting a lot
of<00:03:54.599> weights<00:03:54.930> burning<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.680> calories

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
of weights burning a lot of calories

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
of weights burning a lot of calories
the<00:03:56.849> second<00:03:57.269> skier<00:03:57.540> however<00:03:58.049> which<00:03:58.470> is

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the second skier however which is

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.890 
the second skier however which is
sliding<00:03:59.099> in<00:03:59.280> ski<00:03:59.549> along<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.269> is<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.480> lot<00:04:00.720> more

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
sliding in ski along this is a lot more

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.709 
sliding in ski along this is a lot more
energy<00:04:01.260> efficient
