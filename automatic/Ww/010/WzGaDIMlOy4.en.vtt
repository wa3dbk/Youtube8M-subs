70<00:03:03.210> pounds<00:03:03.510> -<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> little<00:03:03.750> heavier<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.920> know

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
70 pounds - a little heavier you know

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.250 
70 pounds - a little heavier you know
about<00:03:05.340> seventy-five<00:03:05.790> horsepower<00:03:05.940> down<00:03:06.420> but

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
about seventy-five horsepower down but

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.410 
about seventy-five horsepower down but
man<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.770> were<00:03:07.860> riding<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.160> street<00:03:08.370> triple<00:03:08.520> and

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
man you were riding a street triple and

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.840 
man you were riding a street triple and
you<00:03:09.990> know<00:03:10.080> we<00:03:10.260> were<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.220> same<00:03:11.430> pace<00:03:11.670> in

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
you know we were on the same pace in

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.700 
you know we were on the same pace in
those<00:03:11.970> roads<00:03:12.210> weren't<00:03:12.480> way<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:13.110> guys<00:03:13.380> the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
those roads weren't way you guys the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.200 
those roads weren't way you guys the
plate<00:03:13.920> dropped<00:03:14.190> me<00:03:14.340> yesterday<00:03:17.030> they<00:03:18.030> just

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
plate dropped me yesterday they just

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.150 
plate dropped me yesterday they just
that<00:03:18.450> mean<00:03:18.600> just<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:19.080> impulse<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.740> handles

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that mean just that impulse just handles

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.030 
that mean just that impulse just handles
so<00:03:20.520> well<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.120> turns<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:22.140> fast<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.920> just

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
so well it turns really fast and it just

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.160 
so well it turns really fast and it just
holds<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.820> leaning<00:03:24.210> or<00:03:24.390> holds<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.930> line

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
holds that leaning or holds that line

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.600 
holds that leaning or holds that line
and<00:03:25.650> one<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.980> reasons<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.310> have<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.520> much

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
and one of the reasons you have so much

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.040 
and one of the reasons you have so much
confidence<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.240> bike<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.930> has

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
confidence in the bike is it just has

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.350 
confidence in the bike is it just has
such<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.350> great<00:03:28.440> feel<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.240> know

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
such a great feel you really you know

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.180 
such a great feel you really you know
you<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:31.050> feel<00:03:31.320> exactly<00:03:31.800> what<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:31.980> brakes

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
you really feel exactly what the brakes

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.890 
you really feel exactly what the brakes
are<00:03:32.340> doing<00:03:32.550> exactly<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.060> tires<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.480> exactly

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
are doing exactly the tires and exactly

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.500 
are doing exactly the tires and exactly
the<00:03:34.020> suspension<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.530> doing<00:03:34.710> at<00:03:34.770> all<00:03:34.950> times

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the suspension is doing at all times

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.420 
the suspension is doing at all times
what<00:03:36.510> what<00:03:36.750> about<00:03:36.870> your<00:03:37.230> configuration<00:03:38.040> makes

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
what what about your configuration makes

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.840 
what what about your configuration makes
that<00:03:38.670> possible<00:03:39.260> well<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.920> mean<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> lot<00:03:41.820> of

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
that possible well it's I mean a lot of

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.280 
that possible well it's I mean a lot of
it<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.150> pretty<00:03:42.390> much<00:03:42.450> inherent<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it is pretty much inherent to the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.930 
it is pretty much inherent to the
electric<00:03:43.620> drivetrain<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.250> mean<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.460> course<00:03:44.490> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
electric drivetrain I mean of course the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.220 
electric drivetrain I mean of course the
motor<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.720> don't<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.050> lot<00:03:46.200> of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
motor you don't have a lot of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.110 
motor you don't have a lot of
reciprocating<00:03:46.830> mass<00:03:47.070> we<00:03:47.730> have<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.880> lot<00:03:48.090> of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
reciprocating mass we have a lot of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.570 
reciprocating mass we have a lot of
torque<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:49.410> power<00:03:49.650> delivery<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.340> so

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
torque and the power delivery is just so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.970 
torque and the power delivery is just so
smooth<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.390> all<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.900> adds<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.739> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
smooth so all of that adds that that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.120 
smooth so all of that adds that that
feeling<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.760> confidence<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.510> top<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.930> that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
feeling of confidence on top of that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.320 
feeling of confidence on top of that
we've<00:03:56.130> put<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.370> lot<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.640> work<00:03:56.760> into<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> chassis

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
we've put a lot of work into the chassis

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.600 
we've put a lot of work into the chassis
development<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.500> when<00:03:59.010> we<00:03:59.130> took<00:03:59.280> all<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
development so when we took all the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.100 
development so when we took all the
learnings<00:03:59.940> from<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.180> race<00:04:00.330> bikes<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.900> kind

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
learnings from the race bikes and kind

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.560 
learnings from the race bikes and kind
of<00:04:01.140> compiled<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.800> into<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.280> chassis<00:04:02.700> design

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
of compiled it into the chassis design

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.420 
of compiled it into the chassis design
for<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.020> impulses<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.709> we've<00:04:05.130> got<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> great

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
for the impulses so we've got a great

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.240 
for the impulses so we've got a great
battery<00:04:05.730> system<00:04:06.270> on<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.690> bike<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:08.070> this

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
battery system on the bike so for this

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.930 
battery system on the bike so for this
kind<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.850> riding<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:10.050> we<00:04:10.170> did<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:11.760> need<00:04:11.910> a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
kind of riding that we did you need a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.060 
kind of riding that we did you need a
battery<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.360> can<00:04:12.660> deliver<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.320> lot<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.860> power

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
battery that can deliver a lot of power

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.610 
battery that can deliver a lot of power
there's<00:04:14.519> seven<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.030> these<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.660> each<00:04:15.720> bite<00:04:16.080> now

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
there's seven of these on each bite now

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.479 
there's seven of these on each bite now
we<00:04:16.680> call<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.310> BPM<00:04:18.620> 1590<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.919> it's<00:04:20.070> 15

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
we call this the BPM 1590 so it's 15

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.840 
we call this the BPM 1590 so it's 15
volts<00:04:20.850> 90<00:04:21.630> amp<00:04:21.780> hours<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.550> really

user<00:04:45.410> engagement<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.190> involvement<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.669> the

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
user engagement and involvement in the

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.490 
user engagement and involvement in the
riding<00:04:46.910> experience<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.930> lot<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.139> that<00:04:48.289> stem

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
riding experience and a lot of that stem

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.140 
riding experience and a lot of that stem
thank<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.919> Ron<00:04:49.099> can<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.699> tell<00:04:49.910> us<00:04:49.970> how<00:04:50.030> that

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
thank you Ron can you tell us how that

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.999 
thank you Ron can you tell us how that
work<00:04:50.300> was<00:04:50.449> sure<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:51.199> is<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.410> six-speed

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
work was sure this is a six-speed

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.240 
work was sure this is a six-speed
gearbox<00:04:52.280> that's<00:04:52.789> on<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.120> bike<00:04:53.330> we<00:04:54.289> kind<00:04:55.160> of

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
gearbox that's on the bike we kind of

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.830 
gearbox that's on the bike we kind of
had<00:04:55.370> an<00:04:55.460> epiphany<00:04:55.759> as<00:04:56.120> we've<00:04:56.330> been<00:04:56.479> developing

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
had an epiphany as we've been developing

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.540 
had an epiphany as we've been developing
this<00:04:57.259> bike<00:04:57.560> over<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> last<00:04:57.979> couple<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.460> years

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
this bike over the last couple of years

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.589 
this bike over the last couple of years
that<00:04:59.199> a<00:05:00.199> direct<00:05:00.770> drive<00:05:00.919> system<00:05:01.669> always<00:05:02.030> leads

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
that a direct drive system always leads

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.600 
that a direct drive system always leads
you<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:03.020> compromise<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:03.889> either<00:05:04.340> got<00:05:04.580> to

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
you to compromise you either got to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.700 
you to compromise you either got to
choose<00:05:04.970> whether<00:05:05.300> you

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
choose whether you

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.000 
choose whether you
your<00:05:05.920> top<00:05:06.310> speed<00:05:06.550> in<00:05:07.150> the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
your top speed in the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.530 
your top speed in the
and<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.250> never<00:05:10.490> get<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.910> best<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.360> both

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
and so you never get the best of both

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.810 
and so you never get the best of both
worlds<00:05:11.600> does<00:05:12.350> at<00:05:12.560> any<00:05:12.800> range<00:05:13.070> or<00:05:13.370> efficiency

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
worlds does at any range or efficiency

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.900 
worlds does at any range or efficiency
it<00:05:14.690> depends<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.320> lot<00:05:15.500> on<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.800> drive<00:05:16.010> cycle<00:05:16.550> so

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
it depends a lot on the drive cycle so

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.159 
it depends a lot on the drive cycle so
the<00:05:17.270> answer<00:05:17.540> is<00:05:17.570> yes<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:18.110> know

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
the answer is yes I know

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.249 
the answer is yes I know
there<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:20.729> have<00:05:20.849> less<00:05:21.090> efficiency<00:05:21.840> on<00:05:22.139> the

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
there is you have less efficiency on the

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.350 
there is you have less efficiency on the
way<00:05:22.379> out<00:05:22.499> to<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.830> rear<00:05:23.009> wheel<00:05:23.279> but<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.210> can

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
way out to the rear wheel but you can

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.179 
way out to the rear wheel but you can
keep<00:05:24.509> the<00:05:24.629> motor<00:05:24.870> operating<00:05:25.770> in<00:05:26.039> its

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:26.189 
keep the motor operating in its

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.469 
keep the motor operating in its
efficient<00:05:26.789> rpm

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
efficient rpm

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.269 
efficient rpm
it's<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.259> it's<00:05:30.319> a<00:05:30.439> fun<00:05:30.620> block<00:05:30.770> really<00:05:30.949> my<00:05:31.099> only

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
it's a it's a fun block really my only

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.619 
it's a it's a fun block really my only
criticism<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.849> that<00:05:31.879> it<00:05:32.090> needs<00:05:32.240> more<00:05:32.389> ground

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
criticism is that it needs more ground

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.379 
criticism is that it needs more ground
clearance<00:05:32.689> okay<00:05:33.620> okay<00:05:34.219> well<00:05:34.939> would<00:05:35.059> you<00:05:35.150> over

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
clearance okay okay well would you over

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.700 
clearance okay okay well would you over
in<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.539> corner<00:05:35.809> you<00:05:35.900> just<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.169> can't<00:05:36.499> go<00:05:36.590> much

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
in the corner you just you can't go much

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.049 
in the corner you just you can't go much
further<00:05:36.919> than<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.189> peg<00:05:37.340> wants<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.669> drag<00:05:37.819> here

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:38.059 
further than the peg wants to drag here

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.209 
further than the peg wants to drag here
gives<00:05:38.539> me<00:05:38.599> your<00:05:38.779> sets<00:05:38.990> out<00:05:39.139> there<00:05:39.319> we<00:05:39.589> will<00:05:40.069> do

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
gives me your sets out there we will do

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.100 
gives me your sets out there we will do
that<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.699> the<00:05:41.029> bikes<00:05:41.240> been<00:05:41.479> designed<00:05:41.900> to

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
that and the bikes been designed to

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.409 
that and the bikes been designed to
accept<00:05:42.409> the<00:05:42.559> host<00:05:42.740> of<00:05:43.330> aftermarket<00:05:44.330> options

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
accept the host of aftermarket options

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.829 
accept the host of aftermarket options
so<00:05:45.020> we're<00:05:45.289> working<00:05:45.409> on<00:05:45.710> a<00:05:45.979> side<00:05:46.849> bags<00:05:47.150> rear<00:05:47.659> bag

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
so we're working on a side bags rear bag

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.399 
so we're working on a side bags rear bag
for<00:05:48.229> it<00:05:48.379> definitely<00:05:49.339> rear<00:05:49.520> sets<00:05:50.020> clip-ons<00:05:51.020> the

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
for it definitely rear sets clip-ons the

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.439 
for it definitely rear sets clip-ons the
initial<00:05:51.919> concept<00:05:52.370> bike<00:05:52.550> was<00:05:52.789> released<00:05:53.120> you

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
initial concept bike was released you

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.790 
initial concept bike was released you
know<00:05:53.479> all<00:05:53.719> those<00:05:53.839> photos<00:05:54.319> where<00:05:54.559> we<00:05:54.620> have<00:05:54.710> two

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
know all those photos where we have two

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.769 
know all those photos where we have two
opponents<00:05:55.039> on<00:05:55.249> the<00:05:55.279> bike<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.819> we've<00:05:56.629> made

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
opponents on the bike and we've made

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.659 
opponents on the bike and we've made
sure<00:05:56.809> that<00:05:57.020> we<00:05:57.229> can<00:05:57.379> fit<00:05:57.559> those<00:05:57.740> on<00:05:57.949> to<00:05:58.279> in<00:05:58.550> the

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
sure that we can fit those on to in the

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.410 
sure that we can fit those on to in the
future<00:05:58.819> awesome

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.910
