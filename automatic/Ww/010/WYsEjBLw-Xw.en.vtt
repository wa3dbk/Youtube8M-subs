00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.919
 hello everyone this week in the iphone applications library 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.259
 in cocoa and I never lie impruded com let's analyze and do as a 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.670
 kind of comparison between the applications that will serve us for 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.360
 Keep indicated that to give all our data and backups in 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.319
 the cloud on the internet 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.889
 we can do it different ways to for free in a secluded way as it is 

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:33.190
 with dropbox although we know that tropos 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.970
 has different payment storage plans but that is not 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.280
 a test robe of two tours 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.740
 and also the option offered by apple with movement the option of the so-called 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.530
 we know that they offer us up to 20 gigs slowly turn 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.870
 let's check how each of the applications work what we can 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.140
 to do with them so that you can choose the one that I prefer 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.270
 mbenga let's go to hit with dropbox 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.290
 dropbox as we say has three stripes we left the settlement one of two 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.040
 appointments that is free that we can access without any problem 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.730
 registering them on your website in dropbox dotcom 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.190
 and then from there we have different plans if we want to pay for 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.910
 they 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.940
 as we see the interface of the forests very simple first of all we go 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.270
 to propose several folders 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.300
 of published torrent photos and videos here obviously we will not have all 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.390
 the configuration possibilities is to say we are not going to be able to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.050
 folders we have to create from our computer or from the web itself 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.380
 of dropbox around our account 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.549
 In any case what we will be able to achieve this active management 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.889
 radar different files to our account how should we navigate 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.710
 and see everything that contains here, for example, not this folder 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.439
 public 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.369
 we have a lot of videos that we have uploaded as well as folders that 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.440
 we share 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.350
 the one network of work the most important and one of the most interesting things that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.780
 more we liked the protection of forests this search engine 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.150
 we see that we do look for anything, for example 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.700
 there are few 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 will also allow us to distribute 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.240
 the omej os said discriminate the searches between 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.059
 files and folders 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.659
 if we search we are going to lack all the files that we have attached to 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.019
 our dropbox account 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.779
 just those that allan referred to the search that we have chosen 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.179
 for example in this case the ayto 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:26.389
 I am very easy very easy to find all our content 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.969
 in dropbox as we see the denial is very simple and for example if 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.699
 we would like to visualize 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.389
 in as much as hundreds a pdf 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.129
 for example that a video that a song a word file then just 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.099
 we have to press the video 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.480
 good in this case is a video uncle thematically we see how a load is 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.169
 quite fast despite being a video then pennies adobe has enough 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:50.979
 you give 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.209
 automatically put at each age it was as if it were some kind of 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.499
 buffer the iphone and as we see 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.499
 start playing it 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:05.919
 It is a very good viewer 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.559
 pique respond quickly 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.529
 we can also 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.240
 deleting them from here would automatically be erased inside it 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.209
 our cruel groups account very comfortable 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.860
 we also have a favorites section 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.330
 that is, we can have several favorite files to have 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 as we were cundi penalties that their direct faster to them 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.179
 if we enter in September we will see how it will mark us 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:33.470
 the space that we are publishing 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.520
 of the two meet woven that gives us free dropbox if as 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:42.169
 insert a security code 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.319
 even to configure 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.109
 the camera that like now we can observe if the contractors 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.889
 and here we can take a picture 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.779
 texcoco to even upload one of our own iphone reel and upload it 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.199
 directly to our dropbox account 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.599
 and is that in the aspect and masters and not have a configuration we could 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.639
 define the quality of the images as we see is a very simple application 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.400
 What quino answer very fast and that we really liked as much as the 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.999
 own service that offer dropbox 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:15.469
 in front of him we have the mobile payment option a thousand details 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:21.180
 strada deste served between cloud that have ap the dike in oslo offers for 79 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.199
 euros per year 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.289
 is a service that as we see the first thing we find in your application 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.520
 for the iPhone it is a structure of folders very similar to sections to the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.939
 own indert fa of our team is not user account 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.989
 as we see here we have different folders documents 4g mobile groups 

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:39.979
 let's say that these are put directly by the application itself 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.039
 however, everything we have up to 10 counts 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.020
 we also have it here for example 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.110
 we see that in images 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.090
 we have two files 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.949
 we load them quickly 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.370
 in this case they are images but of course we can watch movies and 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.009
 peres music files from office ft 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.789
 as we see in the same way 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.680
 we can see it 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.999
 in different vertical modes or in the country to another 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.689
 from here we will also be able to share 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.689
 let's see this document 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.430
 in this way we will be able to send 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.870
 to a good person of our contacts 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.740
 We paid to assess if we wanted to, even if of course we saw the 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.260
 information this but we have for the image it is good for all kinds of 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.199
 records 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.069
 that we have uploaded our account details 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.370
 from the application and iris we will not be able to upload 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.270
 or download any files we were going to be able to visualize them 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.550
 let's go back the recent 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.749
 and let's see the shared 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:48.170
 we also have the folder published here we will be able to 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.370
 percent add so much 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.620
 as we see 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.370
 users 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.460
 the selected one of a man oo user extinction otamendi efe our 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.629
 own contacts 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.990
 and so with this we can share with these contacts that we want 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.090
 a folder full of salary objective files 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.309
 like that is an application that the maybe 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.060
 missing that search engine that had the dropbox option 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.659
 however what is synchronization and what is 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.710
 let's say the integration with all the services of a mobile like this and 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:26.089
 everything in that aspect of mac and the synchronization that we can facer with the 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.310
 service not admitting our family is therefore very interesting 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.680
 this way we will be able to visualize all our files 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.449
 i choose 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.820
 the application of these 2 that is - proposed 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.580
 what else convinces me and it's good that more out there spudis ascent 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.340
 famous serving all the applications tiberius analysis for the iphone 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:51.520
 in almost a twin dot com as well as we have the bagpipes and you have a library 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.330
 applications for iphone a greeting and see you later
