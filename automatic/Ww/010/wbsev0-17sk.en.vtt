00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.010
 next we are going to see the groups in 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.020
 this case the groups would be what 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.380
 analogous to what a club would be for 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.610
 example in the case of of line ie 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.660
 in real life then we 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.399
 we will know these groups because by 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.770
 mail an email that we 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.650
 send a link to the group 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.170
 an internal message on facebook or 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.570
 directly looking for it in the case of 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.880
 make it public since groups can 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.220
 be public or private in the case of 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.400
 the private ones because that we could 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.570
 belong to him if he invites us to be for 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.570
 go to the groups that you already 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.980
 we belong 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.059
 here we have some direct links in the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.739
 left menu like 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.900
 we had access to the pages 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.300
 we will also have the groups then 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.510
 click on it and we will access this 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.309
 group 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.159
 the structure is very similar to that of 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.159
 the pages what happens that in this case 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.490
 It is formed by a series of tabs 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.409
 with information events photos these 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.750
 tabs are configurable then by the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.060
 group administrator then we'll see 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.580
 how to work with them and good the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.140
 advantage that groups bring us 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.799
 in front of the pages is that for example 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.659
 allows us to upload files directly 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.539
 It is very good for you to work 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.720
 to create virtual communities and in 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.210
 principle are they have a purpose 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.659
 many times more restrictive in terms of 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.170
 number of users more than anything by the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.270
 own functionalities and well 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 will appear we simply have a line 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 of time 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.930
 in a chronological chrono which 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.060
 appears in the comments that go 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.220
 putting the group members another 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.320
 difference of the groups with the pages 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.810
 is that the default page always 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 comes only the publications of the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.850
 page as such is to say own 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.520
 page public statements while in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 The case of the group are the users who 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.600
 belong to the group those who contribute 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.459
 content and states so here 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.540
 we will always see different states 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.540
 different users 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.500
 ah
