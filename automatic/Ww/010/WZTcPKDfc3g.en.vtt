whatever it is you want me to do in the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.170 
whatever it is you want me to do in the
future<00:01:11.830> if<00:01:12.070> he's<00:01:12.220> not<00:01:12.400> directing<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:13.030> may

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
future if he's not directing it we may

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:23.050 
future if he's not directing it we may
have<00:01:13.360> we<00:01:14.170> may<00:01:14.320> have<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.560> problem

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:34.300 

period<00:01:23.780> stuff<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.229> fun

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.060 

I<00:01:37.689> think<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:38.869> was<00:01:39.020> when<00:01:39.140> la<00:01:39.409> was<00:01:39.590> probably<00:01:39.950> at

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
I think that was when la was probably at

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.719 
I think that was when la was probably at
its<00:01:40.100> best

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
its best

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.609 
its best
around<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.210> time<00:01:41.240> it's<00:01:41.990> kind<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.350> sad

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
around that time it's kind of sad

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.490 
around that time it's kind of sad
because<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:43.640> beautiful<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:45.289> world

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
because it was so beautiful the world

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.220 
because it was so beautiful the world
just<00:01:45.799> was<00:01:45.950> slower
