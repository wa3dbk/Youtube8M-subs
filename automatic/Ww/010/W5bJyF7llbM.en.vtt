00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 but 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.700
 Hello, I â€™m representing Ilya Avverbukh 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.750
 you master class that gives us king 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.980
 this is our next lesson 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.260
 a wonderful exercise for me personally 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.869
 favorite exercise and all the stars on the ice 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.600
 when it comes to us on the ice begin 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.379
 it is from this unique exercise 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.050
 flashlight this exercise helps you how 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.260
 feel the right knee work 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.769
 so and how to build on 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.250
 Olga 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.680
 so we sat down to deliver for 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.799
 pens continue to do and such a movement 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.659
 that's how we go legs and we have them 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.409
 and further we reduce firstly remarkably 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.280
 many muscle groups work for example 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:05.080
 resulting in this exercise 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 once again sat down developed and legs and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.549
 drew the so-called virtual 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.500
 flashlight flashlight 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:16.479
 done as forward as back therefore 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.149
 I'll show you a move back but believe me 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.500
 back will be much more difficult than the village 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.960
 and back once developed legs and gathered again 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.479
 sat down once developed 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.909
 and collected the village once developed collected and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 back ahead and believe if you 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.170
 understand this movement, then you immediately 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.109
 make a very qualitative leap in 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 his skill 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:52.390
 ice skating seems clear to me 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.789
 it remains only to go out by the raid and 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.530
 practiced proceed to the next 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.189
 our exercise of today's lesson 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.450
 it is also a popular definition 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.280
 sleigh or squat exercise from 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160
 which is still born a lot 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.000
 different exercises we do with you 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.870
 torch 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.750
 then collect the legs and sit down here 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:25.320
 such a position and see how much 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:28.920
 allows us our muscles is a flashlight and 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.530
 the village try to keep balance when 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.820
 we can do this with you very much 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.700
 convincingly we can improvise and 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:46.200
 so body slightly forward 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.810
 flashlight and go ahead do not be afraid the main thing is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.120
 feel people if you can always 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.020
 fall on the flank as we taught farms with you 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.459
 the lessons 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.410

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.620
