from<00:02:02.460> when<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:02.880> went<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:04.320> before<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.340> very

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
from when they went just before the very

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.430 
from when they went just before the very
last<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> guess<00:02:06.540> before<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.960> race<00:02:07.140> last

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440

last time I guess before the race last
fall<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.070> really<00:02:08.460> enjoyed<00:02:08.730> the<00:02:08.880> racetrack<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
fall I really enjoyed the racetrack the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.760 
fall I really enjoyed the racetrack the
way<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> was

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
way it was

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.300 
way it was
I<00:02:11.270> enjoyed<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.420> asphalt<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.320> enjoy<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
I enjoyed the asphalt I enjoy the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.640 
I enjoyed the asphalt I enjoy the
concrete<00:02:14.970> I'll<00:02:15.690> probably<00:02:15.930> live<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> little<00:02:16.500> bit

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
concrete I'll probably live a little bit

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.890 
concrete I'll probably live a little bit
better<00:02:16.920> when<00:02:17.190> they<00:02:17.280> reconfigured<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:18.240> but<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
better when they reconfigured it but I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.110 
better when they reconfigured it but I
hadn't<00:02:19.290> driven<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.860> since<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.520> did<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> last

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
hadn't driven it since they did the last

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630 
hadn't driven it since they did the last
change<00:02:21.720> last<00:02:22.170> fall<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> really<00:02:23.370> don't<00:02:23.490> know

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
change last fall so I really don't know

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.640 
change last fall so I really don't know
how<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.880> answer<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:30.110> Chris<00:02:31.110> Pratt's<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
how to answer that Chris Pratt's a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
how to answer that Chris Pratt's a
really<00:02:32.220> good<00:02:32.400> question<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
really good question I think the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.200 
really good question I think the
uniqueness<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.380> Bristol<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.340> banking<00:02:35.880> and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
uniqueness of Bristol is the banking and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.510 
uniqueness of Bristol is the banking and
the<00:02:36.450> way<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.810> approach<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.010> me<00:02:38.130> from<00:02:38.460> a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the way you approach it to me from a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.960 
the way you approach it to me from a
race<00:02:38.790> driver<00:02:39.030> standpoint<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.830> think<00:02:41.310> it's

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
race driver standpoint I think it's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.510 
race driver standpoint I think it's
definitely<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:43.050> part<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.890> evolution

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
definitely a part of for the evolution

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.660 
definitely a part of for the evolution
of<00:02:44.550> NASCAR<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.330> help<00:02:45.540> NASCAR<00:02:46.080> Croom<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.950> what

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
of NASCAR and help NASCAR Croom to what

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.040 
of NASCAR and help NASCAR Croom to what
it<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.880> today<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> simple

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
it is today just with a simple

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
it is today just with a simple
standpoint<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.880> stopped<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.540> everything

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
standpoint they stopped and everything

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.950 
standpoint they stopped and everything
just<00:02:52.260> white<00:02:52.620> string<00:02:53.040> theme<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.550> us<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.780> me

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
just white string theme to us and to me

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:04.750 
just white string theme to us and to me
if<00:02:55.380> there's<00:02:55.590> no<00:02:55.770> place<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.250> racing<00:02:56.760> Bristol

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.210 

I'm<00:03:05.760> NASCAR<00:03:06.270> champion<00:03:06.750> billion<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.380> Bristol
