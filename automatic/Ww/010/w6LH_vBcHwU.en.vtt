00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
a year this year I could go by land but

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.079 
a year this year I could go by land but
there's<00:00:18.439> 10,000<00:00:18.949> kilometers<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.369> C<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:19.880> it's

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
there's 10,000 kilometers of C so it's

looked<00:00:28.249> at<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.429> unit<00:00:29.079> alternatives<00:00:30.079> and

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
looked at the unit alternatives and

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.929 
looked at the unit alternatives and
struck<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.559> problem<00:00:31.039> there<00:00:31.429> was<00:00:31.550> no<00:00:31.759> money

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
struck a problem there was no money

struck a problem there was no money
funds<00:00:32.450> available<00:00:32.899> I<00:00:33.460> needed<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.609> cunning<00:00:34.940> plan

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079

funds available I needed a cunning plan
may<00:00:36.079> be<00:00:36.140> something<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:36.620> could<00:00:36.679> try<00:00:37.190> myself<00:00:37.340> what

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
may be something I could try myself what

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.119 
may be something I could try myself what
if<00:00:38.000> I<00:00:38.090> built<00:00:38.329> an<00:00:38.480> aircraft<00:00:38.870> that's<00:00:39.739> got<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.010> be

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
if I built an aircraft that's got to be

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.209 
if I built an aircraft that's got to be
fairly<00:00:40.850> easy<00:00:41.059> surely<00:00:41.690> I<00:00:42.019> did<00:00:43.010> some<00:00:43.190> research

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
fairly easy surely I did some research

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.759 
fairly easy surely I did some research
and<00:00:43.789> found<00:00:43.879> a<00:00:44.239> really<00:00:44.750> cool<00:00:45.019> care<00:00:45.289> blog<00:00:45.530> which

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
and found a really cool care blog which

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:46.869 
and found a really cool care blog which
had<00:00:45.949> an<00:00:46.039> article<00:00:46.399> about<00:00:46.519> an<00:00:46.730> aircraft

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
had an article about an aircraft

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.900 
had an article about an aircraft
designed<00:00:47.510> by<00:00:47.780> captain<00:00:48.769> Ralph<00:00:48.980> Barnaby<00:00:49.519> of<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
designed by captain Ralph Barnaby of the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.899 
designed by captain Ralph Barnaby of the
u.s.<00:00:50.179> Navy<00:00:50.210> he's<00:00:51.109> a<00:00:51.140> glider<00:00:51.499> experiment<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:52.309> a

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
u.s. Navy he's a glider experiment and a

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.689 
u.s. Navy he's a glider experiment and a
veteran<00:00:53.359> and<00:00:53.749> aircraft<00:00:54.170> designed<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.339> use<00:00:55.550> it

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
veteran and aircraft designed so use it

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.790 
veteran and aircraft designed so use it
as<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.030> basis<00:00:56.420> course<00:00:57.379> if<00:00:57.499> you're<00:00:57.620> going<00:00:57.710> to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
as the basis course if you're going to

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.619 
as the basis course if you're going to
design<00:00:57.980> something<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:58.699> need<00:00:58.879> to<00:00:58.999> use<00:00:59.179> AutoCAD

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
design something you need to use AutoCAD

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.540 
design something you need to use AutoCAD
so<00:00:59.960> I<00:00:59.989> created<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.469> model<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.069> play<00:01:01.339> off

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
so I created a model of this play off

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.149 
so I created a model of this play off
the<00:01:01.699> plane<00:01:01.909> and<00:01:02.120> AutoCAD<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.870> even<00:01:03.649> use<00:01:03.859> the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
the plane and AutoCAD and even use the

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.340 
the plane and AutoCAD and even use the
new<00:01:04.339> visualization<00:01:04.820> tools<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.689> CNN<00:01:06.079> flight

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
new visualization tools to a CNN flight

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.789 
new visualization tools to a CNN flight
as<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.799> lifts<00:01:06.979> Auckland<00:01:07.750> heading<00:01:08.750> over<00:01:09.140> of<00:01:09.530> San

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
as it lifts Auckland heading over of San

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.330 
as it lifts Auckland heading over of San
Francisco<00:01:10.310> Navy<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.880> then<00:01:11.570> into<00:01:11.840> vegas

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.279 

it<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.030> probably<00:01:15.179> a<00:01:15.359> bit<00:01:15.479> fast<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.990> came<00:01:16.170> up

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
it was probably a bit fast I came up

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.020 
it was probably a bit fast I came up
with<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.469> shorter<00:01:16.829> route<00:01:17.009> direct<00:01:17.880> from

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
with a shorter route direct from

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.240 
with a shorter route direct from
Auckland<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> Los<00:01:18.780> Angeles<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:20.009> Las<00:01:20.219> Vegas

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
Auckland to Los Angeles in Las Vegas

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
Auckland to Los Angeles in Las Vegas
saves<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.359> few<00:01:21.509> kilometers<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.380> looked

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
saves a few kilometers and it looked

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.240 
saves a few kilometers and it looked
like<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.920> might<00:01:23.069> work<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> simulation<00:01:25.250> as

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
like it might work on the simulation as

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.819 
like it might work on the simulation as
you<00:01:26.399> can<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:26.759> entering<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> into<00:01:27.869> America<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
you can see entering it into America and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.880 
you can see entering it into America and
then<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.189> into<00:01:29.369> vegas<00:01:29.789> itself<00:01:30.709> but<00:01:31.709> some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
then down into vegas itself but some

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.080 
then down into vegas itself but some
production<00:01:32.340> growing<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:32.969> could

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
production growing so that we could

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
production growing so that we could
build<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.390> prototype<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:34.259> got<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> test<00:01:34.860> seasons

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
build a prototype has got a test seasons

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
build a prototype has got a test seasons
and<00:01:35.780> course<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:36.899> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> talk<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> the

and course you're going to talk to the
factory<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.069> that<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.490> mean<00:01:38.670> using<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.630> new

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
factory so that you mean using the new
