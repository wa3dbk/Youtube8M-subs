00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.640
 men 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 but now let's focus on England 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.739
 and this is the wording of the match 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.079
 according to the eufa here in tel aviv e le 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.450
 most accredited teams in the group and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.600
 it will be Italy to kick off 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.399
 nine minutes always 00 attention italy 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 in attack the ball ending that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.379
 ends a little at the other shot a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.750
 to cross from a piece of real estate to one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 raise from batman defense of the dive 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 there came no ball that went to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 touch the base of the stake to raise 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 of bianchetti still verratti that puts 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.590
 down the first ball there is the launch 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 klein in advantage 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.500
 erroraccio klein goes to save not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.450
 they mean klein butland klein went 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.600
 towards the goalkeeper butt land went towards 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 klein the head body was a kind of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.420
 own goal 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 at this point he had to intervene in 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 sweep the same klein and put on 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.850
 corner kick but we are inside the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 ours in the middle of the field and touches it to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.720
 brown there is room for the swan is there 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 possibility of the counter-attack there is borini 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 that is being released on center three 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.009
 men around distinguished advancing 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.840
 ball and chain 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.390
 the opening for florenzi to enter 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.259
 vigor joe cole warns hung up 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.829
 hooked in the area the referee leaves 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.960
 continue 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.090
 the referee let go that we 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.640
 it had seemed strict on the other side 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 we are far away from our location 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.649
 far away but it seemed absolutely 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.960
 that the English defender is dawson 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.090
 entered directly on the legs of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.979
 florenzi all get off the bench 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.750
 light blue arms for devis eats 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.640
 protect england remember network 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.980
 the advantage of england but that's all 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.380
 useless because uilca man was offside 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.750
 had tripped offside rejoicing 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.520
 useless by the British wilk man 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.149
 he was in an irregular position 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.860
 just the signal of the linesman 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.990
 swiss boksic we follow this corner 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.209
 Shelvey does not come out of the fray bar them 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.530
 value that remains affected in the wall e 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.420
 this time there is a throat 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.090
 of england which one brings into 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.820
 advantage in the scrum iii has scored 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.310
 Captain Henderson was not 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.100
 impeccable Italian defense in this one 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.680
 circumstance there are protests because they do 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.050
 that the referee is returning to his 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.239
 decision let's see what happened 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.610
 Italy was even starting in 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.340
 counter-attack let's see what the referee decides 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.989
 that the goal could have been 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.200
 canceled they don't know it yet 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.890
 English is so goal that is canceled 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.030
 well there is the English goalkeeper who must 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.220
 target it because it's really scarce 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.290
 now on a corner kick the sixth 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.170
 for Italy it really came out at 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.769
 fantozzi with the high fist missed 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.700
 completely a very easy grip then 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.440
 he is also lucky 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.080
 perhaps for this reason England 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.269
 turns out to be one of the least defenses 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.510
 punch look what he's doing 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.489
 batman loses ball on referral tries to 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.470
 go away parini who enters the area of 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.570
 this penalty must be punished 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.730
 goalkeeper because really scarce and therefore 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.280
 we must try to hammer this 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.190
 jack buckland which is first wrong 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720
 completely punch the exit but to 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.060
 his luck a rebound did him 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.829
 find the ball in your hands and then e 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.750
 then here while he was doing the 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.670
 raise held too much ball ha 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.910
 persa borini did not take advantage of the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.720
 field goal at the buzzer shi Cota on 62 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.540
 100 and rigor for Italy 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.970
 rigor for Italy later the rope 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.630
 bisantis soon I will return the first 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.580
 line 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.680
 let's see the referee's decision 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.180
 change still decision becomes 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.190
 punishment from the edge this referee 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.660
 French is a bit indecisive though 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.400
 punishment from the limit for Italy like 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.220
 there is also indecision here 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.470
 at the gym we feel this rigor given 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.630
 or not given by giuseppe bisantis venghi 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.700
 he had not given his own land to Italy 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.340
 the referee gave the referee Gotti 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.720
 and in French, however, one must say 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.700
 thing 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.130
 these decisions 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.109
 runs but corrects itself then eventually has 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.690
 always right because in fact the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.360
 foul had occurred outside the area does not give 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.260
 as well as the English goalkeeper 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.050
 demonstration of great security 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.000
 this French referee because he has first 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 scored a goal to the British then has it 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.820
 retired 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.169
 here he assigned the very strict rigor 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.990
 the indication so much so that the whole 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.190
 blue bench entered the field to 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.650
 to protest 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.270
 then the referee evidently maybe 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.470
 trusts his assistants a lot 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.020
 because it must have come to this 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.480
 once the first referee reports 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.590
 of brings the Belgian of the vacation to say that 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.900
 out there though maybe the referee 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.120
 French was better placed and I believe that 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.980
 even in this case he is right 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.330
 when it gives you a penalty but the same 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.820
 can say the English they have 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.800
 insulted for a long time for a goal that is then 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.440
 it was only canceled later 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 well in short one remains with the bitterness in 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.890
 mouth though be careful because one 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.740
 punishment from the limit with lorenzo insigne 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:15.480
 that tries to transform lorenzo already 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.910
 free kick in Italy goes into 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.360
 advantage with the ball from there to 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.560
 insigne is better than a 33th penalty 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.630
 italy under 21 1 england under 21 0 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.850
 and this time there is none for anyone 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.610
 referee points to the field and why this 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.729
 item 1 to 0 for Italy that therefore the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.700
 33rd minute takes the lead 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.160
 Lorenzo, as a distinguished punishment, we do not disturb 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.890
 the myths but in this case the marathon 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.620
 because from the left edge it went to 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.720
 kick on the pole and the door e 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.390
 fachlum we repeat goalkeeper not 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.280
 impeccable plunges force touches the 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.770
 balloon perhaps could have also 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.910
 we are not interested in talking but we are interested 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.580
 just that Italy 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.380
 at the 33rd minute he was taken to 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.530
 advantage with a punishment of lorenzo 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.420
 afterwards after the referee had 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.830
 first indicated the penalty spot 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.710
 here there is also the character of these 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.200
 very young boys because in short 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.710
 it might have seemed from the point of view of 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.530
 moral a blow as a penalty 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.480
 first given and then not granted and then it is 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.730
 the goal arrived on lorenzo's free kick 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.550
 distinguished one of the talents of this phase 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.490
 final and part henderson the flight of far 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.190
 save the game at ninety-fourth e 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.800
 ends here ends here Italy beats 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.990
 england under 21 10 and starts at 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.810
 great his way in the final phase 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.080
 of the European has decided a goal of insigne 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.440
 on punishment to the 33 th of the recovery 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.920
 a second time full of uncertainties and 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.860
 indecision of choices of the referee things 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.140
 on which then the back is returned 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.090
 back but it never seems wrong 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.470
 right final decision also to make 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.240
 beat the free kick in 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.740
 England even if the recovery was 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.720
 expired because to hold firm 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.550
 barrier took a long time to finish 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.060
 henderson attracted the parts one is 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.010
 She earned its rating in the report card 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.320
 putting the ball and rejecting the 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.760
 balloon shop runs with three whistles has 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.740
 sent the teams to the locker room 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.200
 lorenzo insigne the match winner is 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.419
 also named as a man of the match 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.520
 immediate choice by the web 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.230
 lorenzo insigne that in the final it was 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.690
 even took a yellow card for 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.390
 therefore not having respected the barrier 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.460
 ends 1 0 Italy in the standings after the 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.640
 first day of the group with three points 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.830
 follow israel norway 1 england 0 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.540
 we return to the field on Saturday at 8pm 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.250
 and 30 Italian is always here at 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.260
 bloomfield i tel aviv and with the owners of 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.180
 house of israel but we did one 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.310
 password certainly not decisive but
