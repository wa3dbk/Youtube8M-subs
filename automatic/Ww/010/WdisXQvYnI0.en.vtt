00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
then from time to time and you can

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.780 
then from time to time and you can
usually<00:02:17.600> tell<00:02:18.080> by<00:02:18.320> pressing<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.980> top<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.640> see

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
usually tell by pressing the top and see

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.699 
usually tell by pressing the top and see
if<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.090> springs<00:02:20.480> back<00:02:20.630> or<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.140> could<00:02:21.320> also<00:02:21.500> use

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
if it springs back or you could also use

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.960 
if it springs back or you could also use
a<00:02:21.950> toothpick<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> those<00:02:23.750> are<00:02:23.930> two<00:02:23.959> really<00:02:24.200> good

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
a toothpick so those are two really good

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.610 
a toothpick so those are two really good
foolproof<00:02:25.970> methods<00:02:26.600> for<00:02:26.840> telling<00:02:27.290> if<00:02:27.440> your
