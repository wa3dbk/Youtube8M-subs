00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.530 

and<00:02:44.290> he<00:02:44.410> may<00:02:44.560> look<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.920> little<00:02:44.950> weird<00:02:45.540> but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
and he may look a little weird but

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.930 
and he may look a little weird but
that's<00:02:46.720> also<00:02:46.990> because<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.550> if<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.730> air

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that's also because when and if the air

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.280 
that's also because when and if the air
people<00:02:49.210> are<00:02:49.420> aren't<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.900> front<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.170> your<00:02:50.230> face

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
so keep they can't really see how weird

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.700 
so keep they can't really see how weird
it<00:02:52.270> looks<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.950> also<00:02:54.190> have<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:55.120> powder<00:02:55.710> like

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
you fold it like a taco shell and you

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.290 
you fold it like a taco shell and you
just<00:03:11.440> dip<00:03:11.710> it<00:03:11.740> lightly<00:03:12.250> because<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.910> picks<00:03:13.120> it

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
just dip it lightly because it picks it

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.240 
just dip it lightly because it picks it
up<00:03:13.420> real<00:03:13.810> good<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.740> should<00:03:14.920> be<00:03:15.010> good<00:03:15.190> enough

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
