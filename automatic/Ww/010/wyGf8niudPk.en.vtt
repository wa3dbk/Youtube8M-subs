00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.309
 hello friends continue 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.309
 broadcast 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:19.210
 why have you seen us today? 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.689
 g-shock watch review 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:28.599
 they all really liked was not all 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:41.579
 into two things so I decided to go 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:41.579
 I also found a multi-colored watch order 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 it will be interesting to see this watch 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.449
 the parcel arrived in very good condition 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.449
 passed very quickly 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.449
 only a week since the first 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.449
 parcels 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.850
 delivery too fast as far as we 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:27.960
 although only mussels on the package we have 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:29.250
 eight pieces what color range 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.880
 but 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.880
 men 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.660
 very good 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.740
 black and white 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 walked 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.380
 still wonderfully orange 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 the black 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.560
 and here is blue 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.840
 but 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.580
 that is, is such a program that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 exists 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.209
 In fact, the principle is another such 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.769
 package wrapped so there must be a clock 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.769
 still other color 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.260
 watches are in great demand by people 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.260
 they liked 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.530
 such here 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.530
 clock 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.670
 dancing black and white is classic 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.170
 the solution is more extreme and here 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.410
 blue blue also look very good 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.410
 All of them 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.790
 with beautiful lighting 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.700
 not visible on the light 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:32.690
 and even to it covers all phones 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.690
 visibility will also be fairly simple 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.870
 the cure game 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.340
 this is what they say by inexperience at the beginning 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:06.140
 ordered did not ask questions on this 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.360
 come good enough quality but 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:18.380
 without retail packaging in principle 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:26.750
 seeds like the solution they are inexpensive and 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:31.640
 very beautiful good quality but how 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:34.100
 it says i blink you 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.120
 now of course there is already some 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:42.500
 certain experience is necessary to enter into 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.570
 communication with the seller ask questions 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.550
 sellers themselves usually meet us 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.410
 on 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.950
 but all the questions you have raised are very 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:55.569
 sociable and that's all of course 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.629
 they want to save and therefore 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.629
 he 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:05.020
 they usually save on cost 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:08.139
 shipment ie delivery to us and if 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:14.150
 they get rid of this packaging to 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:18.710
 less to pay for the delivery of well means 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:21.740
 will be sold as this stock here 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.639
 such a short reviewer thanks 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.639
 great bye
