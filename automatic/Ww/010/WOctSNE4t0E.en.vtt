00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.599 

and<00:00:04.750> the<00:00:05.750> question<00:00:06.259> it<00:00:06.589> was<00:00:06.979> a<00:00:07.040> good<00:00:07.250> idea<00:00:07.309> to

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
and the question it was a good idea to

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.980 
and the question it was a good idea to
always<00:00:07.729> remind<00:00:08.029> yourself<00:00:08.389> what<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:08.599> question

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
always remind yourself what the question

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.959 
always remind yourself what the question
was<00:00:09.160> the<00:00:10.160> question<00:00:10.309> was<00:00:10.580> flooded<00:00:10.879> the

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
was the question was flooded the

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.939 
was the question was flooded the
husband's<00:00:11.299> career<00:00:11.480> prospects<00:00:12.199> and<00:00:12.469> a<00:00:12.740> 10

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:12.949 
husband's career prospects and a 10

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.640 
husband's career prospects and a 10
upside<00:00:13.369> down<00:00:13.930> it's<00:00:14.930> like<00:00:15.139> an<00:00:15.260> indication

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
upside down it's like an indication

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.460 
upside down it's like an indication
don't<00:00:16.430> look<00:00:16.760> for<00:00:16.820> a<00:00:17.090> new<00:00:17.359> beginning<00:00:17.539> because

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
don't look for a new beginning because

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.260 
don't look for a new beginning because
you're<00:00:18.619> not<00:00:18.710> going<00:00:18.859> to<00:00:18.920> find<00:00:19.099> one<00:00:19.400> it's<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.090> bit

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
you're not going to find one it's a bit

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.490 
you're not going to find one it's a bit
like<00:00:20.300> a<00:00:20.660> 10<00:00:20.990> is<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.260> end<00:00:21.440> of<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.710> cycle<00:00:21.950> and<00:00:22.390> so

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
like a 10 is the end of the cycle and so

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.640 
like a 10 is the end of the cycle and so
there's<00:00:24.500> value<00:00:25.010> in<00:00:25.720> going<00:00:26.720> over<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.199> cycle

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
there's value in going over the cycle

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.580 
there's value in going over the cycle
going<00:00:27.800> over<00:00:28.270> earlier<00:00:29.320> experiences<00:00:30.320> and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
going over earlier experiences and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.709 
going over earlier experiences and
seeing<00:00:31.369> what<00:00:31.640> could<00:00:31.970> have<00:00:32.059> been<00:00:32.210> done<00:00:32.270> or

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
seeing what could have been done or

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.260 
seeing what could have been done or
should<00:00:32.750> have<00:00:33.079> been<00:00:33.230> done<00:00:33.410> differently<00:00:33.590> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
should have been done differently and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.569 
should have been done differently and
understanding<00:00:35.270> how<00:00:35.559> poor<00:00:36.559> decisions<00:00:37.249> made<00:00:37.550> in

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
understanding how poor decisions made in

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.719 
understanding how poor decisions made in
the<00:00:37.819> past<00:00:38.079> led<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:39.739> difficult<00:00:40.519> situation

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:40.729 
the past led to a difficult situation

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.930 
the past led to a difficult situation
that's<00:00:41.390> going<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.659> continue<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.729> so<00:00:43.729> it's<00:00:43.879> a

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
that's going to continue and so it's a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.759 
that's going to continue and so it's a
bit<00:00:44.120> like<00:00:45.249> examine<00:00:46.249> the<00:00:46.339> old<00:00:46.609> and<00:00:47.199> see<00:00:48.199> how<00:00:48.469> it

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
bit like examine the old and see how it

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.189 
bit like examine the old and see how it
led<00:00:49.069> to<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.399> present<00:00:49.909> and<00:00:50.089> once<00:00:51.019> you've

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
led to the present and once you've

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.829 
led to the present and once you've
examined<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.799> old<00:00:52.010> see<00:00:52.760> what<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.210> could<00:00:53.510> do

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
examined the old see what you could do

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.889 
examined the old see what you could do
or<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.199> should<00:00:55.039> do<00:00:55.339> differently<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:56.839> you

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
or you should do differently so you

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.619 
or you should do differently so you
don't<00:00:57.170> get<00:00:57.319> the<00:00:57.440> same<00:00:57.620> outcome<00:00:58.129> here<00:00:58.579> as<00:00:58.729> this

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
don't get the same outcome here as this

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.989 
don't get the same outcome here as this
new<00:00:59.870> cycle<00:01:00.350> begins<00:01:00.679> again<00:01:00.889> because<00:01:01.670> otherwise

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
new cycle begins again because otherwise

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.770 
new cycle begins again because otherwise
if<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:02.510> if<00:01:03.019> you<00:01:03.739> don't<00:01:04.489> examine<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.239> past<00:01:05.479> and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
if you if you don't examine the past and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.570 
if you if you don't examine the past and
see<00:01:05.930> what<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.290> could<00:01:06.440> change<00:01:06.830> you're<00:01:07.430> going

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
see what you could change you're going

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.940 
see what you could change you're going
to<00:01:07.670> be<00:01:07.729> doomed<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.300> repeat<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.830> new

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
to be doomed to repeat it and so the new

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.920 
to be doomed to repeat it and so the new
cycle<00:01:10.340> will<00:01:10.460> begin<00:01:10.580> but<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.480> husband<00:01:11.780> can

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
cycle will begin but the husband can

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.540 
cycle will begin but the husband can
find<00:01:12.140> himself<00:01:12.290> in<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.950> similar<00:01:13.310> kind<00:01:13.400> of

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
find himself in a similar kind of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.310 
find himself in a similar kind of
situation<00:01:14.120> six<00:01:14.390> months<00:01:14.690> or<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.870> year<00:01:14.930> from<00:01:15.110> now

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
situation six months or a year from now

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.650 
situation six months or a year from now
because<00:01:16.280> he<00:01:16.490> didn't<00:01:16.790> because<00:01:17.360> he<00:01:17.450> did<00:01:17.630> things

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
because he didn't because he did things

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.110 
because he didn't because he did things
the<00:01:18.020> same<00:01:18.320> way<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:19.220> he's<00:01:19.370> always<00:01:19.580> done<00:01:19.940> them

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
the same way that he's always done them

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.410 
the same way that he's always done them
so<00:01:20.540> there<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.810> value<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:22.000> looking<00:01:23.000> at<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.210> past

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
so there is value in looking at the past

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.010 
so there is value in looking at the past
assessing<00:01:24.290> it<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.510> remembering<00:01:26.510> what<00:01:26.720> worked

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
assessing it and remembering what worked

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.300 
assessing it and remembering what worked
and<00:01:27.140> what<00:01:27.230> didn't<00:01:27.650> work<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:28.070> making

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and what didn't work and making

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.240 
and what didn't work and making
adjustments<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.410> adjustment<00:01:31.130> can

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
adjustments and the adjustment can

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.750 
adjustments and the adjustment can
simply<00:01:31.670> be<00:01:32.020> instead<00:01:33.020> of<00:01:33.110> doing<00:01:33.350> nothing<00:01:33.760> do

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
simply be instead of doing nothing do

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.790 
simply be instead of doing nothing do
something<00:01:36.580> sort<00:01:37.580> out<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.880> past<00:01:38.560> rather<00:01:39.560> than

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
something sort out the past rather than

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.910 
something sort out the past rather than
look<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.370> future<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.750> identified<00:01:42.710> bad

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
look to the future and so identified bad

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.120 
look to the future and so identified bad
habits<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.930> stop<00:01:44.930> doing<00:01:45.140> them<00:01:45.440> or<00:01:45.620> replace

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
habits and stop doing them or replace

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.399 
habits and stop doing them or replace
him<00:01:46.160> with<00:01:46.310> something<00:01:46.610> else<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:48.080> other<00:01:48.170> thing

him with something else the other thing

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.630 
him with something else the other thing
is<00:01:48.440> going<00:01:49.040> back<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.400> knight<00:01:49.610> of

difficulties now whereas if it goes and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.249 
difficulties now whereas if it goes and
analyzes<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.300> has<00:02:08.450> happened<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.019> cycle

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
analyzes what has happened in the cycle

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.339 
analyzes what has happened in the cycle
and<00:02:10.120> figures<00:02:11.120> out<00:02:11.239> what<00:02:11.540> he<00:02:11.629> cares<00:02:11.900> about<00:02:12.019> what

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
and figures out what he cares about what

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.140 
and figures out what he cares about what
he<00:02:12.409> really<00:02:12.560> values<00:02:13.129> then<00:02:13.670> he's<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.969> to<00:02:14.060> be

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
he really values then he's going to be

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.629 
he really values then he's going to be
in<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.269> much<00:02:14.389> stronger<00:02:14.749> position<00:02:15.549> when<00:02:16.549> it

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:16.639 
in a much stronger position when it

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.380 
in a much stronger position when it
comes<00:02:16.879> to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
comes to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.820 
comes to
making<00:02:17.900> forward<00:02:18.260> progress<00:02:18.290> with<00:02:18.890> his<00:02:19.010> career

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
making forward progress with his career

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.590 
making forward progress with his career
the<00:02:21.830> future<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.640> nine<00:02:22.819> assault<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.480> it's

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
the future is the nine assault and it's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.540 
the future is the nine assault and it's
upside<00:02:23.959> down<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.410> well<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.740> get<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.400> and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
upside down as well we get so to you and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.309 
upside down as well we get so to you and
so<00:02:25.730> do<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.600> bit<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.080> go<00:02:27.200> from

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
so do you so it's a bit like we go from

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.290 
so do you so it's a bit like we go from
10<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.770> nine<00:02:27.980> it's<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.670> bit<00:02:28.819> like<00:02:28.970> that's<00:02:29.180> going

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
10 to nine it's a bit like that's going

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.050 
10 to nine it's a bit like that's going
to<00:02:29.390> be<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.630> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.930> take<00:02:30.080> one<00:02:30.110> step<00:02:30.740> back

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
to be is going to take one step back

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.670 
to be is going to take one step back
into<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> old<00:02:32.330> cycle<00:02:32.750> which<00:02:33.140> i<00:02:33.319> think<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.590> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
into the old cycle which i think is a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.220 
into the old cycle which i think is a
good<00:02:33.860> thing<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:35.180> still<00:02:35.480> sought<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.080> there's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
good thing so it still sought so there's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.600 
good thing so it still sought so there's
going<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.410> be<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.100> more<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.580> same

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
going to be going to be more of the same

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.540 
going to be going to be more of the same
and<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.780> continuation<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.010> difficulties

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
and a continuation of the difficulties

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.150 
and a continuation of the difficulties
here<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.390> again<00:02:42.880> what<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.090> clear<00:02:44.390> prospects

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
here so again what it is clear prospects

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.400 
here so again what it is clear prospects
not<00:02:46.300> spectacular<00:02:47.300> now<00:02:47.660> or<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.140> immediate

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
not spectacular now or in the immediate

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.710 
not spectacular now or in the immediate
future<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:50.180> there's<00:02:50.330> going<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.510> be<00:02:50.540> no

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
future so that there's going to be no

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.710 
future so that there's going to be no
escape<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.530> no<00:02:52.160> certainty<00:02:52.940> i<00:02:52.970> think<00:02:53.420> for<00:02:53.690> a

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
escape and no certainty i think for a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.449 
escape and no certainty i think for a
little<00:02:54.140> bit<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.380> time<00:02:56.890> he's<00:02:57.890> not<00:02:58.070> going<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.340> be

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
little bit of time he's not going to be

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.400 
little bit of time he's not going to be
able<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.820> see<00:02:59.030> his<00:02:59.239> way<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.840> see<00:03:00.140> his<00:03:00.290> way

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
able to see his way just see his way

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.930 
able to see his way just see his way
look<00:03:00.650> at<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.830> hands<00:03:01.310> covering<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> eyes<00:03:02.650> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
look at the hands covering the eyes so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.479 
look at the hands covering the eyes so
instead<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.000> looking<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.720> future<00:03:06.260> if<00:03:07.190> he

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
instead of looking to the future if he

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.300 
instead of looking to the future if he
looks<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.970> Past<00:03:08.230> sorts<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> out<00:03:09.470> then<00:03:10.160> he's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
looks to the Past sorts it out then he's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.800 
looks to the Past sorts it out then he's
going<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.550> be<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.760> much<00:03:10.880> better<00:03:10.940> position<00:03:11.420> so

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
going to be in a much better position so

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
going to be in a much better position so
continue<00:03:12.350> analyzing<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.730> past<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:15.709> put

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
continue analyzing the past to put

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.960 
continue analyzing the past to put
himself<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.310> better<00:03:16.489> position<00:03:16.670> to

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
himself in a better position to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.790 
himself in a better position to
understand<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.750> get<00:03:17.870> benefits<00:03:18.500> from<00:03:18.560> the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
understand and get benefits from the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.900 
understand and get benefits from the
future<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.840> fact<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.140> he's

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
future and so the fact that he's

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.640 
future and so the fact that he's
stepping<00:03:22.910> back<00:03:23.329> is<00:03:23.600> partly<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.230> think<00:03:24.290> an

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
stepping back is partly I think an

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.120 
stepping back is partly I think an
indication<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.310> he<00:03:25.519> is<00:03:25.610> going<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
indication that he is going to

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.550 
indication that he is going to
participate<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.989> analyzing<00:03:29.989> what's<00:03:30.230> going<00:03:30.440> on

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
participate in analyzing what's going on

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.350 
participate in analyzing what's going on
but<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.980> fact<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.400> upside<00:03:31.790> down<00:03:32.030> can<00:03:32.269> be

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
but the fact of this upside down can be

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.330 
but the fact of this upside down can be
an<00:03:32.450> indication<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:33.530> he<00:03:33.799> also<00:03:33.950> at<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> same

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
an indication that he also at the same

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.890 
an indication that he also at the same
time<00:03:34.700> says<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.180> know<00:03:35.269> what's<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.600> point

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
time says you know what's the point

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.530 
time says you know what's the point
there's<00:03:36.200> no<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.650> can<00:03:37.549> do<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.150> why<00:03:38.329> should

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
there's no I can do this but why should

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.930 
there's no I can do this but why should
I<00:03:38.630> bother<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.920> at<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.340> point<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.850> probably

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
I bother and at that point you probably

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.900 
I bother and at that point you probably
want<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.630> encourage<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.350> person<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.730> make

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
want to encourage the person to to make

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.470 
want to encourage the person to to make
an<00:03:44.060> effort<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.100> what<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.280> think<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.910> is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
an effort and this is what I think it is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.630 
an effort and this is what I think it is
not<00:03:47.980> maybe<00:03:49.209> good<00:03:50.209> enough<00:03:50.540> or<00:03:51.400> there's<00:03:52.400> maybe<00:03:52.549> a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
not maybe good enough or there's maybe a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.819 
not maybe good enough or there's maybe a
better<00:03:52.850> way<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.180> encouraging<00:03:53.780> people<00:03:54.170> than

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
better way of encouraging people than

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.770 
better way of encouraging people than
just<00:03:54.860> saying<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.430> know<00:03:55.579> put<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.299> time<00:03:56.570> into

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
just saying you know put the time into

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.930 
just saying you know put the time into
it<00:03:56.930> will<00:03:57.230> be<00:03:57.440> worth<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.769> in<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.920> end<00:03:58.040> because

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
it will be worth it in the end because

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.390

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
been through then you're going to know

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.810 
been through then you're going to know
what<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.220> want<00:05:15.400> in<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.610> future

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
what it is that you want in the future

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.400

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
and you're going to know the way forward

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.250 
and you're going to know the way forward
so<00:05:20.410> that's<00:05:20.590> one<00:05:20.830> an<00:05:21.790> alternative<00:05:22.720> to<00:05:22.870> by<00:05:23.110> all

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
so that's one an alternative to by all

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.050 
so that's one an alternative to by all
means<00:05:23.470> pick<00:05:23.710> three<00:05:23.950> cards<00:05:24.190> but<00:05:24.730> if<00:05:24.910> you're

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060

finding you pick three cards and it's a

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.130 
finding you pick three cards and it's a
struggle<00:05:26.890> think<00:05:27.790> about<00:05:28.000> past<00:05:28.300> present<00:05:28.990> and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
struggle think about past present and

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.880 
struggle think about past present and
future<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:32.080> find<00:05:32.410> it's<00:05:32.590> going<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.830> be

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
future and you find it's going to be
