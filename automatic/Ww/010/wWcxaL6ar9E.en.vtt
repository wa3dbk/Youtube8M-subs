in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.269> previous<00:00:12.509> session<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.710> learned

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
in the previous session we have learned

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.700 
in the previous session we have learned
about<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.730> elements<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> camera<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.650> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
about the elements of the camera that is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.810 
about the elements of the camera that is
aperture<00:00:17.490> shutter<00:00:17.940> speed<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.930> ISO<00:00:19.580> in<00:00:20.580> this

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
aperture shutter speed and ISO in this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.939 
aperture shutter speed and ISO in this

exposure<00:00:32.090> before<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.660> through<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
exposure before we go through the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.740 
exposure before we go through the
session<00:00:34.320> let's<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.340> through<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.360> exposure

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
session let's go through the exposure

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.430 
session let's go through the exposure
