00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.340
 how are you? 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.800
 Well, in general, if you want to try 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:21.480
 with this way to shorts 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:25.470
 although at the same time everything is so well here we are 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.430
 start making the price on the side of it 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:46.170
 orbits and on what can our tissues on friend 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:03:03.570
 friend to that side it needs you to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:03:09.450
 general on the seamy side of me already 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:16.860
 It turned out though I do not have 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:27.320
 for some reason it does not work so I am alone 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:27.320
 I have no more side though so in 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:55.560
 in general , I studied and now we sew 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:04:02.910
 our halves also you can take 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:07.250
 lace or you can take a piece 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.250
 fabrics and make something like demeshko 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.740
 but if my masks will fall off the cord 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:32.220
 birds have a body 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:35.960
 and pouch and sew so that we 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.960
 nothing broke 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:05:05.700
 neatly in general if you like 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:36.480
 my girlfriend tore shorts because 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:41.360
 What else to do in a manner that in fact he is so 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.850

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:50.100
 nothing to do is your little doll 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:56.210
 just not to get in but actually one 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.210
 just once you can suddenly become something there 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:21.980
 knot and go here for the same 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.980
