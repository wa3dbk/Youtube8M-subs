00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:20.019
 video tips how to have packs 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:23.220
 100 m 2 fifa points and without spending the 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:26.800
 credits because no one wants to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.880
 come to put money in not 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.710
 much less want to put 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.359
 money from a game and then no 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.700
 many people also do not have 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.550
 want to spend their credits in 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.280
 pacts so long to have shit 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.989
 when we can say 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.690
 suddenly me for these two people for 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.989
 this person there I say again eba look 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.090
 my video simply because it's 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.480
 a video where we will be able to open 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.600
 packs have packs without spending 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.010
 credit and 100 m 2 fifa points and in 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.699
 winner in version of credits for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.230
 can improve our players for this 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.650
 we can see that I already have two packs 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.390
 in my shop and not packs of 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.950
 little steps we'll call that we're going 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.970
 call it jumbo packs 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 but I said I like to drink so these 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.750
 debates that must be worth 12,000 credit 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.420
 24th in donations 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.860
 at least 20 in gold and three rare good 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.870
 so how did I do to have two 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.560
 dead steamers is fine the technique is 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.100
 simple you do there division 1 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.840
 you have a division choice 2 times 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.790
 that you are brought to 10 in a year under 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.900
 water because it's just soul man 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.290
 must do well we see the fall pitfall 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.080
 it's eleven players under the water or you 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.180
 choose those with 5500 of 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.280
 rewards plus impact john bobby orr 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.649
 you choose this one you do your 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.190
 matches until you fall 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.009
 on the pack once you have pack you 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.460
 gold you mean good I want to 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.800
 make a good wine bottle opening ring 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.600
 in this case you do 20 times the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.760
 division 1 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 you keep your packs but you have to do 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.510
 30 wins 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.810
 so if you lose a match you do 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.090
 there all the ups of your controller to you 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.130
 see ps leave the game during a 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.630
 match at least your match it is not 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.019
 saved if you lose and you 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.200
 will try again so you do that 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.760
 for you 20 times we did sometimes 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.360
 we have Easter wines 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.980

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.760
 its 7500 the title but you have to see that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.090
 the matches you win about 500 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.799
 per game so 500 fake says it's five 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.370
 thousand thousand more than 7500 it's twelve 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:19.579
