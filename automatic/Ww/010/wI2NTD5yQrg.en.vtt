00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.750
A Thumbprint Wedding Guest Book

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.950
Hi, Guys, I’m Kristen and Welcome to Studio
Knit!

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.120
I’m so excited.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.960
Today is the DIY Wedding Collaboration with
many of my favorite Kin Community channels.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.740
Together, we are bringing you some of our
favorite DIY projects that are perfect for

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.740
wedding season.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.150
And I personally am recently engaged!

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.230
This is actually a project that I will be
using in my very own upcoming wedding.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.150
It is a Thumbprint Wedding Guest Book.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.930
It’s a great alternative or addition to
the traditional wedding guest book.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.129
As newlyweds, it’s something that will remind
you of that special day.

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.460
And most importantly, everybody is involved
in this project and creating it with you,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.369
so it’s a really great reminder of all of
the support and love that you received on

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:00.470
your wedding day.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.440
So, at the end of my video, make sure to click
the thumbnails and check out the rest of my

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.050
Kin Community friends and their awesome Wedding
DIY projects.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.650
The materials for our Thumbprint Wedding Guest
Book are a canvas, acrylic paints in your

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.600
wedding colors, paintbrushes, ink pads, and
stencils.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.240
To begin, cover your entire canvas with paint.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.540
For my background, I’m using a lot of white
paint with bits of yellow and some grey.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.409
Painting the canvas, rather than just leaving
it blank, gives your entire work and the tree

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.250
you paint over it a more professional and
painterly look.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.270
In that same main color, paint the shape of
your tree.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.890
And if you need to start over, just brush
it into the background and start again.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.500
Once you have your tree shape the way you
like, start painting your tree trunk.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.480
Your color choice is TOTALLY OPTIONAL!

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.451
You can add the names or initials of the wedding
couple with stencils, along with their wedding

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:23.870
date, too.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.000
On the big day, set up your canvas and ask
guests to add leaves to your Wedding Guest

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.030
Book using their very own thumbprints.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.170
You may wish to assign a friend to help your
guests.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:51.040
Make sure to have wipes on hand so they can
clean off their inky thumbs.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.830
You may wish to have your guests sign their
leaf, too, with their signature.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.130
I find that a pencil will actually work best
for this on the canvas.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.390
And make sure the ink is totally dry before
they add their signature.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.180
I hope my video has inspired you to consider
adding a THUMBPRINT GUEST BOOK to your next

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.180
wedding.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.840
As a newly engaged bride-to-be myself, I am
a big believer in managing our limited resources

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.989
of time and money.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.700
This is a really inexpensive project to make
ourselves.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.420
But, you know what?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.111
If you feel stressed for time, and would love
to have a Thumbprint Wedding Guest Book, you

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:37.020
can always share this video with an artsy
member of your wedding party.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.380
They can make it for you.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.590
If you're new to my channel, this is a great
time to subscribe.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.650
I have many more inexpensive, fun, high-quality
Wedding DIY projects coming up that I will

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.540
be making for my very own wedding throughout
this year!

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.680
Happy Wedding Season, everyone.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.459
Bye!
