once<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> journey<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:28.949> go

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
once you have the journey you can go

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.439 
once you have the journey you can go

parallel<00:00:31.109> park<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.619> front<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> garage

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
parallel park it in front of the garage

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.650 
parallel park it in front of the garage
door<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.850> kind<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> blocks<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> garage

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
door so it kind of blocks the garage

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.569 
door so it kind of blocks the garage
door<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.079> opening<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> enter<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
door from opening when you enter it just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
door from opening when you enter it just
like<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> last<00:00:36.059> glitch<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.870> i<00:00:36.899> posted<00:00:37.110> about

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
like the last glitch that i posted about

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.860 
like the last glitch that i posted about
a<00:00:37.829> week<00:00:38.250> ago<00:00:38.420> let's<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.480> ahead<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.750> line<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
a week ago let's go ahead and line that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
a week ago let's go ahead and line that
up<00:00:40.020> correctly<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.620> doesn't<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> be

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
up correctly it doesn't have to be

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
up correctly it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.000> make<00:00:42.510> sure<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
perfect just make sure it's like in the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.920 
perfect just make sure it's like in the
middle<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.800> far<00:00:44.760> close<00:00:45.329> enough<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.629> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
middle and far close enough that it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
middle and far close enough that it
blocks<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.289> garage<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.129> once<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> do

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
blocks the garage and then once you do

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.830 
blocks the garage and then once you do
that<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.879> ahead<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> your

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that go ahead and get out of your

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
that go ahead and get out of your
journey<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.340> walk<00:00:50.940> inside<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
journey here and then walk inside your

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.630 
journey here and then walk inside your
garage<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> blocks

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
garage and you can see that it blocks

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
garage and you can see that it blocks
the<00:00:53.820> garage<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.360> enough<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.930> kind

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the garage just enough and you can kind

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.270 
the garage just enough and you can kind
of<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.379> feet<00:00:55.530> walking<00:00:55.800> around<00:00:56.070> out

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
of see your feet walking around out

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
of see your feet walking around out
there<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> only

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there but just the really the only

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.900 
there but just the really the only
important<00:00:59.219> thing<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.699> sure<00:00:59.730> it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
important thing is to make sure it

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.420 
important thing is to make sure it
blocks<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> garage<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.039> for<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.160> reason<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
blocks the garage and for some reason I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.680 
blocks the garage and for some reason I
could<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> glitch<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> work<00:01:03.539> with

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
could not get the glitch to work with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.910 
could not get the glitch to work with
the<00:01:03.780> adder<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.379> ahead<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.589> certainly

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the adder you can go ahead and certainly

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
the adder you can go ahead and certainly
try<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> decided<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.689> my

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
try but so I decided to do with my

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780 
try but so I decided to do with my
infernus<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.409> worked<00:01:07.560> perfectly<00:01:07.790> still

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
infernus and it worked perfectly still

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.390 
infernus and it worked perfectly still
got<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> good<00:01:09.119> amount<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> money<00:01:10.220> 137<00:01:11.220> k<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
got a good amount of money 137 k I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
got a good amount of money 137 k I
believe<00:01:11.670> something<00:01:11.970> around<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.900> what

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
believe something around there so what

like<00:01:29.220> by<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.640> tree<00:01:29.909> across<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> spot

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
like by this tree across from the spot

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.399 
like by this tree across from the spot
where<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.200> spawned<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:33.200> once<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.380> that

mutual insurance and it will be on the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
mutual insurance and it will be on the
list<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.950> destroyed<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.970> ahead<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.540> retrieve

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
list as destroyed go ahead and retrieve

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.080 
list as destroyed go ahead and retrieve
that<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:40.860> only<00:01:40.979> about<00:01:41.070> 9k<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> use

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that back it's only about 9k if you use

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
that back it's only about 9k if you use
the<00:01:42.119> infernus<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> use<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> adder<00:01:44.430> I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the infernus but if you use the adder I

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
the infernus but if you use the adder I
believe<00:01:44.820> it'll<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.180> 12k<00:01:45.509> something<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
believe it'll be like 12k something like

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420 
believe it'll be like 12k something like
that<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.710> definitely<00:01:46.979> make<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that but you will definitely make that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.240 
that but you will definitely make that
backhand<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.240> 5k<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.899> 9k<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.009> once<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
backhand that was 5k not 9k so once you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.469 
backhand that was 5k not 9k so once you
do<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.670> ahead<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.119> back<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.390> your

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
