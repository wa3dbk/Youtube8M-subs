00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.280 
cut right across here so as you can see
it<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.140> very<00:01:12.320> small<00:01:13.189> flash<00:01:13.610> drive<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.020> part

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
it is a very small flash drive this part

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.740 
it is a very small flash drive this part
here<00:01:15.470> comes<00:01:15.770> off<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.400> that<00:01:16.759> is<00:01:16.939> obviously

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
here comes off and that is obviously

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.990 
here comes off and that is obviously
where<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:17.990> plug<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.290> in<00:01:18.439> now<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:19.579> have<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.759> few

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
where you plug it in now I have a few

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.429 
where you plug it in now I have a few
things<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.450> compare<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.110> to

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
things to compare it to

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.739 
things to compare it to
just<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.549> can<00:01:22.670> understand<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.299> size<00:01:23.539> of

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
just so you can understand the size of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:24.999 
just so you can understand the size of
it<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:23.899> can<00:01:24.049> obviously<00:01:24.289> see<00:01:24.499> it<00:01:24.619> right<00:01:24.890> in<00:01:24.920> my

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
it you can obviously see it right in my

things I really like about this flash

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.169 
things I really like about this flash
drive<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.569> lot<00:02:05.959> of<00:02:06.079> flash<00:02:06.289> drives<00:02:06.319> have<00:02:07.179> some

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
drive is a lot of flash drives have some

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.690 
drive is a lot of flash drives have some
type<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.539> trial<00:02:08.899> bloatware<00:02:09.649> software<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.490> them

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
type of trial bloatware software on them

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.180 
type of trial bloatware software on them
but<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.630> one<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.530> if<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.740> open<00:02:13.100> it

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
but this one as you can see if I open it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.940 
but this one as you can see if I open it
has<00:02:13.599> zero<00:02:14.599> items<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:17.590> actually<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:18.860> bit

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
has zero items and actually a little bit

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.330 
has zero items and actually a little bit
more<00:02:19.160> than<00:02:19.340> 32<00:02:19.730> gigabytes<00:02:20.209> available<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.950> as

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
more than 32 gigabytes available and as

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.059 
more than 32 gigabytes available and as
you<00:02:22.459> can<00:02:22.550> see<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.000> nothing<00:02:23.209> on<00:02:23.540> it

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
you can see there is nothing on it

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.920 
you can see there is nothing on it
that's<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.310> nice<00:02:25.459> little<00:02:25.670> thing<00:02:25.930> because

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
that's just a nice little thing because

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.020 
that's just a nice little thing because
very<00:02:27.320> few<00:02:27.380> flash<00:02:27.890> drives<00:02:28.250> actually<00:02:28.790> have

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
very few flash drives actually have

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
very few flash drives actually have
absolutely<00:02:29.480> nothing<00:02:29.600> on<00:02:29.930> them<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.320> have

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
absolutely nothing on them that I have

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.589
