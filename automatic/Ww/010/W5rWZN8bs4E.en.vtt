00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello today we will make a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.410
 small introductory video of the geer fit 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.840
 from samsung so and the first 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.370
 connected bracelet of the mark that is 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.190
 also the first bracelet to have a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 curved screen as you can see 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 and who to use is really very 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.529
 very very interesting i 'm going to put my 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
 wrist to realize this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 that it gives the advantage effectively 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 to have a curved screen is that the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.560
 bracelet fits perfectly to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.580
 wrists and we end up with this 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.079
 screen that should light up 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.390
 if I do not put upside hop 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.030
 necessarily it'll be better like that so 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.450
 this leather bracelet fit it will be connected 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 in bluetooth and a smartphone up and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 as you can see it's not 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.500
 necessarily a samsung smartphone has 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.899
 actually officially it is not 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.129
 supported only spoken by the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.480
 phones of the samsung brand 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.670
 that's not the case he's connected to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 an xperia 1 but we can do it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.309
 to work on a lot of others 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.640
 apartment devices we have a connection 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 4.3 and bluetooth last 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.409
 generation so on the screen when I'm going 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.630
 to drive the wrist towards me inevitably the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.860
 position is not very that allows to have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.900
 their to posted and then to go 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.509
 navigate 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.180
 so here I'll be able to navigate so the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.710
 pedometer the exercise so that's the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.189
 running the bike ride the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.590
 hiking 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.320
 we will have the heart rate 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.670
 since actually nothing below the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.670
 bracelet a small sensor that allows 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.340
 to have the heart rate 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.900
 we're going to have control too 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 multimedia so to handle reading from 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.189
 music or videos on the phone 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.869
 parameters and location of the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.700
 phone 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.670
 obviously lapping there the notifications 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
 so there for example I have a missed call 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 messages and so all 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.680
 smartphone notifications that go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.689
 to be configured a timer and a 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.049
 stopwatch is obviously the management of the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.000
 sleep 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.409
 it suffices to say that we begin to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.890
 to sleep and we'll have all the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.930
 news 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.170
 so this is the real first bracelet that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.869
 makes a mix between 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.000
 connected bracelets and the watch 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.560
 connected so it allows no 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.939
 to call but allows to have 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.709
 many features between the 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.599
 health bracelet and connected bracelet 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.250
 on the phone we really have many 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.940
 features on the phone one has 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.000
 two apps that will be my the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.930
 geer manager painted the geer manager who 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.940
 is right here even if you do not see 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.400
 well that will help manage the the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.170
 bracelet and the slf that will allow to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.120
 manage all health data 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.640
 so it's really a very 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 very interesting surely the most 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.200
 nice to wear and the most fun to 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.730
 use that I put one finds himself 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 really with a little him who is at the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.110
 limit as fun as the people and who will 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.700
 also evolve quite a bit in time so 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 I can only advise you 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.560
 it's the samsung geer fiq
