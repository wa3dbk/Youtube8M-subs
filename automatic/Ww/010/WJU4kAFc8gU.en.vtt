only<00:00:42.840> question<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> what

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:59.310 

coconut

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:33.850 

that's<00:02:00.159> sulfur

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.470 

yo<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.069> actually<00:02:35.519> this<00:02:35.700> part<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.060> here<00:02:36.209> is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
yo can actually this part right here is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.170 
yo can actually this part right here is
called<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.810> crater<00:02:37.200> called<00:02:37.760> Halima<00:02:38.760> Hamato

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
called a crater called Halima Hamato

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390 
called a crater called Halima Hamato
crater<00:02:39.629> right<00:02:39.959> out<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.130> Hawaii

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
crater right out here here in Hawaii

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.620 
crater right out here here in Hawaii
Volcanoes<00:02:41.959> actually<00:02:43.190> releases<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.450> we

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
Volcanoes actually releases here so we

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.190 
Volcanoes actually releases here so we
have<00:02:45.890> flowing<00:02:46.890> out<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.099> material<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.420> so

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
have flowing out of material here so

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.920 
have flowing out of material here so
hawaii<00:02:49.860> volcanoes<00:02:50.040> seem<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.970> relatively

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
hawaii volcanoes seem to be relatively

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.170 
hawaii volcanoes seem to be relatively
safe<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.650> observe<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.670> i'm<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> put<00:02:54.030> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
safe to observe so i'm going to put a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.690 
safe to observe so i'm going to put a
drop<00:02:54.510> right<00:02:54.840> there<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.769> it's<00:02:56.160> gonna<00:02:56.340> slowly

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
drop right there and it's gonna slowly

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.699 
drop right there and it's gonna slowly
maybe<00:02:57.090> work<00:02:57.420> its<00:02:57.630> way<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.110> ocean<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
maybe work its way to the ocean but a

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.580 
maybe work its way to the ocean but a
lot<00:02:58.980> slower<00:02:59.220> than<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.510> paint<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
lot slower than this is that paint that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
lot slower than this is that paint that
right<00:03:01.860> there<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.160> your<00:03:02.280> basic<00:03:02.790> pancake<00:03:03.420> sir

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150 

Oh
