whiter<00:00:29.310> woods<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> lot<00:00:30.119> longer<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
whiter woods will be a lot longer and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.730 
whiter woods will be a lot longer and
i'll<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> lot<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.470> interesting

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
i'll have a lot more interesting

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.120

features such a sharp turns jumps and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.260 
features such a sharp turns jumps and
they'll<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.460> spread<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.790> throughout

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
they'll be more spread out throughout

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.430 
they'll be more spread out throughout
the<00:00:36.360> tracks<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.290> by

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the tracks they don't take you by

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590

surprise<00:00:37.879> there'll<00:00:38.879> also<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> big<00:00:39.450> mountain

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
surprise there'll also be a big mountain

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000 
surprise there'll also be a big mountain
in<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> middle<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> track<00:00:40.620> which<00:00:40.890> will

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
in the middle of the track which will

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
in the middle of the track which will
help<00:00:41.129> block<00:00:41.430> off<00:00:41.610> most<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> tracks<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.600> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
help block off most of the tracks so you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.030 
help block off most of the tracks so you
don't<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:42.960> any<00:00:43.020> situations<00:00:43.649> where<00:00:43.860> we're

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040

trying to render the whole tracker at
any<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.140> time<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> problem<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.100> have

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
any one time which is a problem we have

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
are recolors it's also pretty easy to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
are recolors it's also pretty easy to
mass-produce<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.079> need<00:01:37.290> we'll<00:01:37.890> keep

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
mass-produce them as we need we'll keep

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.069 
mass-produce them as we need we'll keep
adding<00:01:38.369> more<00:01:38.400> hair<00:01:38.610> styles<00:01:39.180> over<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.570> too<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
adding more hair styles over time too so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.360 
adding more hair styles over time too so
we<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.439> more<00:01:40.650> characters

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
we can do more characters

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.980 
we can do more characters
at<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.120> moment<00:01:43.270> they<00:01:43.540> can<00:01:43.690> only<00:01:43.750> do<00:01:43.870> a<00:01:43.900> few

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
at the moment they can only do a few

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.200 
at the moment they can only do a few
different<00:01:44.380> things<00:01:44.410> so<00:01:45.190> here's<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.700> little

sound<00:02:57.620> effects<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.310> rivers<00:02:58.640> and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
sound effects I think that rivers and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.150 
sound effects I think that rivers and
birds<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.050> about<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.290> for<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:03.560> don't

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
birds so that's about it for now don't
