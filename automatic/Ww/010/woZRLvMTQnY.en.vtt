00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
but it's like a Welsh thing that people

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.680 
but it's like a Welsh thing that people
say<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.459> not<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.120> round<00:02:54.420> when

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
say just so you know not just round when

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.660 
say just so you know not just round when
you're<00:02:54.840> throwing<00:02:55.080> them<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.800> there

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.860 

really<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> third<00:02:59.970> thing<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:00.510> what<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.660> have

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
really a third thing but what I have

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.990 
really a third thing but what I have
noticed<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.130> look<00:03:02.340> over

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
noticed is that look at this look over

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.850 
noticed is that look at this look over
lighting<00:03:03.480> look<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:03.810> everything<00:03:04.080> looks<00:03:04.500> really

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
lighting look at everything looks really

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.180 
lighting look at everything looks really
crappy<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:06.420> hate<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.830> probably

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
crappy and I hate it and I probably

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.620 
crappy and I hate it and I probably
should<00:03:08.430> have<00:03:08.519> waited<00:03:08.700> until<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.269> Sun<00:03:09.480> had

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
should have waited until the Sun had

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.170 
should have waited until the Sun had
gone<00:03:09.660> down<00:03:10.220> present<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> sizing<00:03:11.790> down<00:03:11.820> with

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
gone down present the sizing down with

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.320 
gone down present the sizing down with
the<00:03:12.269> hands<00:03:12.480> down<00:03:13.250> because<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.790> all

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
the hands down because it's just all

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.900 
the hands down because it's just all
this<00:03:15.360> washed<00:03:16.050> out<00:03:16.380> what<00:03:17.190> makes<00:03:17.370> me<00:03:17.519> look<00:03:17.640> crap

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
this washed out what makes me look crap

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.630 
this washed out what makes me look crap
and<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.450> hate<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.780> let's<00:03:19.230> go<00:03:19.380> home<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.550> not

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
and I hate it let's go home and it's not

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.240 
and I hate it let's go home and it's not
very<00:03:20.670> much<00:03:20.910> as<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.420> move

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
very much as I can move

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.090 
very much as I can move
that's<00:03:23.090> just<00:03:23.360> effort<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.990> will<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.620> find<00:03:24.980> a

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
that's just effort I will have to find a

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.140 
that's just effort I will have to find a
new<00:03:25.130> position<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:26.210> do<00:03:26.300> these<00:03:26.480> things<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:31.150> maybe

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
new position to do these things in maybe

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.420 
new position to do these things in maybe
if<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.390> move<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.690> camera<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.410> might<00:03:33.590> help<00:03:33.800> so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
if I move the camera that might help so

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.930 
if I move the camera that might help so
maybe<00:03:34.640> if<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:34.940> my<00:03:35.210> blogs<00:03:35.540> from<00:03:35.810> now<00:03:35.960> on<00:03:39.940> from

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
maybe if I do my blogs from now on from

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.690 
maybe if I do my blogs from now on from
this<00:03:41.150> angle<00:03:41.350> obviously<00:03:42.350> not<00:03:42.530> like<00:03:42.830> doing<00:03:43.520> this

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
this angle obviously not like doing this

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.210 
this angle obviously not like doing this
by<00:03:44.090> looking<00:03:44.240> at<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> camera<00:03:45.130> obviously<00:03:46.130> up

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
by looking at the camera obviously up

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.570 
by looking at the camera obviously up
you<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:46.490> that<00:03:47.050> with<00:03:48.050> my<00:03:48.200> body<00:03:48.410> 10<00:03:48.740> you<00:03:49.430> know

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
you like that with my body 10 you know

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.100 
you like that with my body 10 you know
because<00:03:50.120> otherwise<00:03:50.360> i'd<00:03:50.600> be<00:03:50.630> really<00:03:50.900> weird

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
because otherwise i'd be really weird

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.520 
because otherwise i'd be really weird
like<00:03:51.910> let's<00:03:52.910> see<00:03:57.970> okay<00:03:58.970> that's<00:03:59.180> better

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
like let's see okay that's better

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.490 
like let's see okay that's better
probably<00:04:00.530> good<00:04:01.209> yeah<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.630> actually<00:04:03.140> look<00:04:03.470> like

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
probably good yeah I actually look like

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.390 
probably good yeah I actually look like
I'm<00:04:03.860> human<00:04:04.340> at<00:04:04.940> least<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.709> that's<00:04:07.220> an

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
I'm human at least so that's an

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.490 
I'm human at least so that's an
improvement<00:04:08.110> probably<00:04:09.110> not<00:04:09.200> going<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.440> be

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
improvement probably not going to be

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.110 
improvement probably not going to be
holding<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.950> camera<00:04:10.220> like<00:04:10.550> this<00:04:10.580> because

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
holding the camera like this because

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.810 
holding the camera like this because
it's<00:04:11.450> probably<00:04:11.750> pretty<00:04:11.930> shaky<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.820> also

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
it's probably pretty shaky and also

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.610 
it's probably pretty shaky and also
rounds<00:04:14.270> already<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:17.120> i'm<00:04:17.959> not<00:04:18.169> gonna<00:04:18.320> be<00:04:18.440> all

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
rounds already so i'm not gonna be all

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.750 
rounds already so i'm not gonna be all
the<00:04:18.739> next<00:04:19.209> time<00:04:20.209> someone<00:04:21.140> who's<00:04:21.650> willing<00:04:21.829> so

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
the next time someone who's willing so

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.850 
the next time someone who's willing so
you<00:04:23.240> know<00:04:23.390> drop<00:04:24.080> me<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.230> message<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.740> the
