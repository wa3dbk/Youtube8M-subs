that result in this episode or maybe

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
that result in this episode or maybe
after<00:01:59.189> some<00:01:59.549> fight<00:01:59.759> scenes<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.299> log<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
after some fight scenes they log out and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
after some fight scenes they log out and
they<00:02:01.290> settle<00:02:01.649> things<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.219> mean<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.670> just

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
they settle things I mean they just

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.850 
they settle things I mean they just
thought<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.840> talk<00:02:04.320> about<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.799> oh<00:02:05.180> yeah

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
thought they just talk about it oh yeah

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.260 
thought they just talk about it oh yeah
so<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.190> actually<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.030> would<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
so I actually do think that would be a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I actually do think that would be a
pretty<00:02:09.420> cool<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.979> not<00:02:11.879> spend

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
pretty cool way to do it not not spend

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.300 
pretty cool way to do it not not spend
too<00:02:12.390> much<00:02:12.540> time

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
too much time

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.370 
too much time
on<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.940> episode<00:02:14.239> give<00:02:14.750> us<00:02:14.870> some<00:02:15.080> great

on it in this episode give us some great

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.589 
on it in this episode give us some great
action<00:02:15.650> because<00:02:16.520> we<00:02:16.610> already<00:02:16.790> had<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> pretty

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
action because we already had a pretty

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.110 
action because we already had a pretty
slow<00:02:17.989> episode<00:02:18.410> last<00:02:18.530> week<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.010> then<00:02:19.550> we<00:02:19.880> can
