00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.390
 Cashier 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.979
 I can already see the trees, right? 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.980
 of parts these parts that make up 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.970
 already the part of the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.959
 the truck cabin then I have these is 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:30.700
 that comes 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:38.349
 in this color nor in white is to be white z 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:42.019
 dark white but it comes the whole kit 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:48.709
 these parts here require 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:54.109
 the future I see these apart in the guinea 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:58.250
 and even makes it higher except 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:01.720
 other parties there, the assembly of the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:08.650
 path structure 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 so here I have another box 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:18.380
 inside here we would not look 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:23.299
 So I like this box. I have to 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.410
 lock screw grease some tool like 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.880
 said 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.780
 I came with the engine and beiges, huh? 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.780
 who already knows 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.780
 Make up the truck cabinet 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.660
 I already came here I have exactly the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.880
 Piece I see back here 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:30.140
 so here are also pieces that 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:36.200
 need painting with whoever 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:40.820
 there is already a woman in the ring on the wheels in the 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:51.350
 part of the gat but some other people 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:57.850
 This is it, there is not much to show 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.850
 No, after all, everything is all right. 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:09.350
 exhausted needs assembly life here 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.540
 still low of all this here I have the 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.419
 manual for sure he's down there 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.590
 but I can check if the quantity 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:25.790
 stool that needs enough culture 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:29.770
 thing and here the jatinho piece is of color 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:33.669
 black and only pieces that will make up the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.370
 chassis and everything else 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:40.889
 not all in the trees then you 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.560
 stand out and I'll ride 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:48.659
 so the channel should come out from underneath too 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:52.830
 with that one a truck is that he does not 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:57.840
 is changed is not accepted by 4 how much 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.719
 for two then it will have a short chassis and 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.139
 if I can not say a little shorter than 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.289
 the one who has to read what I 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.139
 I rode a little time and will have videos 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.419
 back and take a look there each 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.779
 little shorter 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:21.289
 only he has a lot of time so the 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:21.289
 Cabin is interesting because of this 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:38.460
