00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.970
 It is Hain station 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:10.970
 It is newly released from Daiba, but Ruvarna 3 ss 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.100
 This is a sinking pencil with a lip 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:18.900
 Range is from zero to 20 centimeters 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.400
 It is best to wind at a retrieve speed that passes through this range . 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.150
 Well the action is best 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.720
 It is the thinking pension of the tip which finished to become 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.890
 Weight is 12.8g 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.110
 Yeah Well 73 I Miri is what 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:38.530
 As you see, the body is finished quite thick, so that minute 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.470
 It's easy to get a good flight distance that you can push the weight 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.750
 It's 73mm but it's very easy to fly 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.550
 The surface conscious sea by pulling just under the water surface with a sinking pencil with a lip 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.090
 For the bus 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.090
 It is a lure 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 A little early for sowing early make a little rod But I'd say even if asked to use in the wound 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.120
 When it rolls up early 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.370
 As we can wind up with action of oneself while making a pulling wave, further more 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.210
 When you are boiling 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 Sometimes the fish are further aware of the 5 surface of the water 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:19.820
 Such usage is also effective There is another completely different usage. 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.090
 This is rod work 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 Then was there use to dock octene 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.590
 Like top water plug 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590
 High 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.080
 Shake your head and take action while smashing water 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.350
 It is a lure that can be used as a pop well 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.680
 Emmer floating 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.460
 It is the difference with the top water plug, but the floating top water 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.350
 If it is a plug 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 On the water surface 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.409
 The proportion of the body that has come out will be high 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.259
 Because it is sinking 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:03.259
 It will top up beautifully in the place where it was just under the surface of the water already about Tsurushi Katsura 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:05.010
 As yet this short lip is it a small trip is Do grabbed the water at random 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.630
 When I got a lot of docks 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.619
 The splash is a subtle splash out while the dock is open for more appealing 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.420
 Willing to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.110
 Because it returns to the shaking of the unique ass shaking of the thinking pencil if you return to the free roll 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.730
 Can be moved with or without rod operation 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.730
 It is lip with thinking training
