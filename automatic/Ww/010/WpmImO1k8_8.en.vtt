00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
goes off and I'm able to see that there

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
goes off and I'm able to see that there
are<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.829> people<00:00:53.129> within<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.940> player's

are other people within that player's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
are other people within that player's
vicinity<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.649> okay<00:00:56.039> that's<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.370> awesome

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
vicinity so okay that's pretty awesome

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.220

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and most of you probably have seen that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.189 
and most of you probably have seen that
but<00:00:58.649> why<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.100> say<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> need<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.510> ghosts

but why do I say you need it well ghosts

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.399 
but why do I say you need it well ghosts
is<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.770> different<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.489> previous<00:01:02.879> Cod's

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
is a lot different from previous Cod's

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
is a lot different from previous Cod's
specifically<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.589> how<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:05.040> reaction<00:01:05.430> time

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
specifically in how little reaction time

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.190 
specifically in how little reaction time
you<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.119> because<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.600> quickly<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you have because of how quickly you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.990 
you have because of how quickly you can
be<00:01:07.290> taken<00:01:07.619> out<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
be taken out so if you get into a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
be taken out so if you get into a
gunfight<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.720> weren't<00:01:09.900> prepared<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
gunfight that you weren't prepared to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
gunfight that you weren't prepared to
have<00:01:10.710> no<00:01:11.220> matter<00:01:11.369> how<00:01:11.640> fast<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.570> your

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
have no matter how fast you think your

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
have no matter how fast you think your
reaction<00:01:12.900> time<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.650> unless<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.610> like

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
reaction time is unless you have like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
reaction time is unless you have like
spidey<00:01:15.240> senses<00:01:15.750> you're<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.409> always<00:01:16.650> gonna
