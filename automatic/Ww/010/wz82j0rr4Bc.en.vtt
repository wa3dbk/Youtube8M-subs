00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.840
 well that's him everyone so 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.940
 I hope you are well and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.080
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.719
 episode 2 of my tutorial series 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.420
 trick shots choose your style 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.400
 so I know it's a lot of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
 time that I did not do my 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.619
 episode 2 but that's because I was 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 really busy so with my new 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 chain that I create with my friend raiko 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 so a tutorial scene trick shots 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 which takes us a lot of time 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.500
 a lot of work 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.759
 so I would put in the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.370
 description of what she is called very 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.899
 killer I really invite you there 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.940
 Subscribe 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.559
 so we close the parenthesis is so 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.469
 today I teach you how to do the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.780
 young boys leader followed by a moonwalk 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.340
 so in this tutorial there are two 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.690
 parties have I already teach you to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 to play the game in mode or that's it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 that there are two ways to do the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.809
 symbol but I'll let you know that one 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.859
 and the moonwalk so that's it 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.840
 running a double 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.549
 triangle to stop running that's it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.760
 so first of all to zoom 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.060
 so you need all the equipment 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.040
 possible 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.750
 you must either cost the throws 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.590
 either a tactical insertion or a key 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.960
 dead and be a semtex so with the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.090
 two others so the the anti shield 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.400
 explosion and the frag the pomegranate will do that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.290
 it does not work and so you need a 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.159
 intervention preferably between 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.159
 really more beautiful 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.630
 so you need either marathon 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.550
 so I recommend a lot of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.900
 marathon that has pass-pass influx 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.350
 much less beautiful it's too fast 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.130
 so we do not really see it so it's 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.330
 really marathon and then these comforters I 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 will teach you to do it not all 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.930
 first you have to remove so you 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 who shoot a ball what you need 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 can reload you need when 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.920
 even a long time to charge then 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.600
 you have to do it yourself 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 put your equipment you still have 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.370
 called on a target you do 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.580
 triangle and carey was waiting here you go 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.580
 like that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.090
 so you 'll tell me it's pretty hot 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.459
 so then that's really 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.079
 simple so you can do it in collar 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.060
 told you with pass passes but I 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.629
 really advise you not so it's 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.079
 it's nosu mode so at first for you 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.659
 train 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.799
 so you're like me you're in 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.030
 say to you I will never arrive 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.930
 point bar when in fact it's 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.760
 really very very simple so the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.319
 tactical that my patrick was given to me at 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.620
 start to get there so it's you 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.379
 you aim you have ap / aim 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.159
 so to her square triangle but that 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.720
 comes alone so it's really a 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.069
 question of timing the zoom so that's it 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.659
 so your triangle because you have to do 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.940
 like that 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:10.510
 appointments really go too fast 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.239
 on that it will never work 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.620
 really be taking time doing a 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.800
 half second what do you believe it is the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.330
 time here it is 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.000
 like that that proved part one 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.280
 of the tutorial the second part so that's 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.900
 the moonwalk so it's not necessary 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.040
 drive it's just you run 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.660
 you make a double triangle you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:41.400
 stop running right So here 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:43.080
 leader that's it so then the two 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.810
 together it really gives something 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.100
 very beautiful so be you are you 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.710
 do like me it makes you want 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.770
 of air either you are trained yourself a 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.270
 little done as waited ouhlala so 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.770
 either you do it in msl so that wants 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.070
 say on the floor you do your due me 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:06.420
 you jump you do a moonwalk so 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:08.100
 wait for it so give me what I 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.320
 will teach you how to do it 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.540
 air not zoom the aude so that's 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:21.180
 really hot good there I received that one 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:22.410
 already waiting for pitbull jus hold me I 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.960

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.960
 so wait here this place there so 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.949
 colors here you see it's really 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.210
 very fast it's not very beautiful 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.360
 jarrie cited once it's not going to 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.360
 make 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.870

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.349
 very fast so me that I read you I 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.539
 marathon advise so that gives that 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:54.310
 as a cheater 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:56.110
 that's where you were doing the double either 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.930
 you can do a marathon to do 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.159
 that if you are really very strong you 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.569
 can do it like that anymore 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:07.389
