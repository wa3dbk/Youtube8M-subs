00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.630
 A template appears here 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.620

 To have more than one prepared like this 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.440
 That 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.450
 The template will be used at random 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.530
 so 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.440
 I just made it by clicking the csv import button 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.950
 I made it in 15 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.540
 csv 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.630
 Get swallowed 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.070
 In to since come out here 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.870

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 I will continue to select 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.070
 You can select more than one 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.590
 Selected and the Fu said: Ikima 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:13.800
 It 's coming out under the tree of choice, but of course I can do one or more 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.800
 One is good and two originals are good 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.720
 One to this kind of person 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.400
 Two and the same 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 Sell Mora went there I'd go up to 50 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.120
 It's about 8 now but I think 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.120
 We combine stored in side 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.270
 I in you can this kind of screen and get up the csv cutter 35 to the next 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.190
 After birth is a tool to rewrite 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.980
 At first click on the data loading button and made it in the second issue earlier 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.540
 What 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.540
 Get the file loaded 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.110
 Rewrite 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.110
 Wow Nde from the start only part of the end 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.820
 I'm rewriting that part but it's a weird conversion 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.670
 However, there is this, but this no conversion Hiragana Katakana 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:15.260
 In it you screen a sense, of course single store does not convert the flat is this katakana 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.810
 Katakana be knitted start-mer the hiragana from the square 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.180
 It's a non conversion keyword here 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.260
 The keyword set here is not returned that the keyword is set here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.090
 Right 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.090
 It is set not to convert 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.890
 I rounded that character of part of India from here start 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:42.450
 It as a function to reduce it is reducing the irrational number of characters because the first one is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:45.150
 If it is set 0 use a sentence from the head Well 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.120
 But it is emoticon number but this 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.720
 To get to know about 300 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:59.140
 If it's full-width, thanks to this edition stock, it's 150 if it's full-width, though 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.650
 You can round the text to 155 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:08.450
 Click the convert button when you can set it in 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.710
 Then I will give the converted one and here too conversion accuracy 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.190
 This yeah 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.580
 It is a part from how to become north side 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.889
 That and this sentence is getting shorter 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.690
 Click on the Structure button 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:26.550

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.259
 And it's a random element, but I can see it 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.449
 Random element 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.710
 If you load it 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:59.160
 This in the bottom of the random button but I know this number that the numbers 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:03.780
 Here not this be taken at'm selfish configured to use any number of this random element 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:08.150

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.930
 You can use any number from 1 to 20 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.550
 This is under the Molester button 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.600

 If you say what kind of file is out and cut it and click it and have it look
