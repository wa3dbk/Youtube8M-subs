00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
as several people who asked me to record

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.470 
as several people who asked me to record
this<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.990> decided<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> go<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.830> this

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
this so I decided to go and do this

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.580 
this so I decided to go and do this
first<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.630> I'm<00:00:21.810> playing<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.410> bit

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
first of all I'm playing the little bit

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
first of all I'm playing the little bit
slower<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.820> reporting<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.390> purpose<00:00:24.720> so

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
slower in the reporting on purpose so

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.670 
slower in the reporting on purpose so
that<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.279> hear<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.449> keep<00:00:28.050> benefit<00:00:28.439> more

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that you can hear and keep benefit more

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
that you can hear and keep benefit more
from<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.429> played<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> faster<00:00:30.269> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
from it if I played it faster you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
from it if I played it faster you
wouldn't<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.679> everything<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.579> wouldn't<00:00:32.940> get

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
wouldn't see everything and wouldn't get

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120 
wouldn't see everything and wouldn't get
every<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.630> detail<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.649> i<00:00:34.680> try<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> slow

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
down a little bit on purpose so that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.260

speak out of parts and interesting
dynamics<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> course<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.530> middle<00:01:07.799> part

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
dynamics and of course the middle part

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.420 
dynamics and of course the middle part
is<00:01:08.280> very<00:01:08.520> sweet<00:01:08.820> sounding<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.430> somewhat

although you can play a little slower

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:36.060 
although you can play a little slower
you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.770> bigger<00:01:26.340> goal

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.310 

and<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.280> play<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.610> staccato<00:01:38.120> part<00:01:38.480> you<00:01:38.990> are

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and to play the staccato part you are

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.290 
and to play the staccato part you are
needs<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.680> be<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.830> little<00:01:40.010> bit<00:01:40.220> stiffer<00:01:40.820> than

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
needs to be a little bit stiffer than

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.510 
needs to be a little bit stiffer than
than<00:01:41.960> normal<00:01:42.440> just<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.070> get<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.400> desired

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
than normal just to get the desired

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.290 
than normal just to get the desired
effect<00:01:44.170> keep<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:45.440> mind<00:01:45.700> when<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:46.820> get<00:01:47.030> to

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
effect keep that in mind when you get to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.660 
effect keep that in mind when you get to
the<00:01:47.510> middle<00:01:49.270> part<00:01:50.270> there's<00:01:50.660> a<00:01:50.750> couple<00:01:50.900> of

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
the middle part there's a couple of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.280 
the middle part there's a couple of
right<00:01:52.670> arm<00:01:52.970> when<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.390> bring<00:01:53.630> area<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.140> you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
right arm when you bring area so you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:05.640 
right arm when you bring area so you
need<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.560> careful<00:01:54.770> with<00:01:55.160> for<00:01:55.790> instance

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.190 

this<00:02:06.650> area<00:02:07.070> right<00:02:07.220> here<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.610> um<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.630> work<00:02:09.080> it

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
this area right here so um just work it

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.170 
this area right here so um just work it
out<00:02:09.290> slower<00:02:09.710> make<00:02:10.130> sure<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.729> understand

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
out slower make sure that you understand

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.250 
out slower make sure that you understand
what<00:02:11.390> your<00:02:11.510> right<00:02:11.630> arm<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.870> supposed<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.170> be

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
what your right arm is supposed to be

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.170 
what your right arm is supposed to be
doing<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.640> speed<00:02:13.910> up<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.090> little

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
doing and then you can speed up a little

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.330 
doing and then you can speed up a little
later<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.860> get<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.970> right<00:02:17.510> tempo<00:02:18.340> in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
later to to get to the right tempo in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.360 
later to to get to the right tempo in
the<00:02:19.580> middle<00:02:19.850> part<00:02:20.440> be<00:02:21.440> sure<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.770> make<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:21.950> sound

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
specifically there's a bunch of speak

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.610 
specifically there's a bunch of speak
canto<00:03:13.860> happening<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.549> be<00:03:14.730> really<00:03:14.940> careful<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
canto happening so be really careful and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.839 
canto happening so be really careful and
trying<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.680> say<00:03:16.799> lower<00:03:17.040> lower<00:03:17.489> part<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
trying to say lower lower part of the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:33.860 
trying to say lower lower part of the
ball

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.120 

so<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.110> part<00:03:35.320> right<00:03:35.380> here<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.680> needs<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.040> be

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
so this part right here it needs to be

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.040 
so this part right here it needs to be
very<00:03:36.280> organized<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.180> very<00:03:37.300> small<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:37.690> can

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
very organized it's very small it's can

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.320 
very organized it's very small it's can
also<00:03:38.290> keep<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.740> to<00:03:38.830> compact<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.850> make<00:03:40.060> sure

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
also keep it to compact and make sure

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.030 
also keep it to compact and make sure
that<00:03:40.720> your<00:03:40.930> state<00:03:41.170> stay<00:03:41.440> closer<00:03:41.740> to<00:03:41.860> this

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that your state stay closer to this

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.670 
that your state stay closer to this
trend<00:03:42.340> should<00:03:42.580> be<00:03:42.670> very<00:03:42.910> very<00:03:43.140> organized<00:03:44.140> well

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
trend should be very very organized well

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.770
