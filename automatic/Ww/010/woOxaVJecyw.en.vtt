00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.750
 hi land friends adventure if you 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.030
 like this video you can share it 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 pressing the button I like and do not forget 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.810
 subscribe to our channel when a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.029
 design lasts despite the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 adversity is inofficious to doubt that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.930
 it is good the design of this knife is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 traced back more than 20 years ago in the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 paths cutlery now the designer and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 also that manages the becker line for 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.090
 that aybar when I was working with 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.920
 Camilo was asked to design a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.989
 knife to replace the traditional 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.760
 but inconvenient and although it's not for 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.560
 nothing the traditional combat night is 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.269
 designed to be a soldier knife 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.800
 as Becker says when he 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.870
 They were asked becker is a soldier 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.609
 who answered I have always thought that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 a soldier is a camping enthusiast 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.469
 armed and with a temperament problem 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 as you see that the design philosophy of 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.350
 a soldier's knife what in the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.390
 land adventure project we have 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 called the field knife is a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170
 knife that should serve mainly 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.970
 for the most mundane tasks that should 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.370
 make the soldiers open the bags of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 ration boxes cut wood ropes 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.330
 build a shelter etcetera and for 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 supposed to be fast enough and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 have a tip to defend yourself and about 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.260
 all be light because if something is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.300
 important in the field 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.130
 then the challenge was to make a knife 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.560
 big enough to work 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.180
 like machete heavy enough 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.010
 to make a good cutter and most 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.810
 possible light to work as 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.700
 a good defense tool to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.620
 same time that it should be of spike 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.570
 complete and with a thickness of sheet 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.190
 significant to leverage the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.080
 result is one of the knives of 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.090
 most versatile field that we have reviewed 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.370
 and certainly because of its size 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.070
 lightness and maneuverability and price 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.200
 possibly one of the best for the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.720
 becker case chose a nylon sheath 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 ballistic with lion soul stiff this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.010
 prevents the noise of the knife in the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 I founded and improves retention because 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.640
 the knife is quite large 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.380
 significant comes with a small 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.030
 box on the front to provide a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.910
 small knife that went like the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.710
 carÃ³n the piggybac especially the bk 13 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.210
 It also comes with an additional pocket 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.760
 to load other essential elements 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.440
 as the sharpener the pair chord and so on 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.480
 it's important because it has the size 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 just to carry the multi tool 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.320
 I think for military use 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 the jerves 600 is indicated and for the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.590
 civil use I always prefer the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.630
 leiderman search although it's a bit 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.450
 heavy I think it's a good balance of 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.670
 weight 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.680
 the handle of the scholarship 7 is very traditional 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.060
 carries the griffin handle that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.980
 initially implemented in the match 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.319
 jacks and both the head and in the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.330
 heel widens to ensure that the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.430
 hand remains in place despite the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.290
 blow or the fan has a wide 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.180
 piercing for the dragonera in this 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.280
 knife is absolutely necessary to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.050
 able to secure it in the fan and to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.330
 Fix it to the forearm if needed 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.040
 do some delicate work with him but 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.080
 the most important feature of 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.120
 scholarship 7 will have to be the production of 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.370
 the sheet at the end of the heel that lends 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.870
 same as others like the scholarship 9 scholarship 5 and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.880
 scholarships a surface what 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.799
 big enough to be able 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.420
 hit the heel to drive the knife 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.610
 if you need it 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.739
 Becker calls him the Xerez maker the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.620
 maker of headaches doing 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.599
 allusion to its possible tactical uses the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.459
 sheet as we had said before has 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.049
 a very conservative design I think I see 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.090
 that remained tied to what was 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.069
 proven that it worked so as not to commit 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.840
 errors has a flat grinding up 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.799
 half of the sheet since as we said 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 before 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.459
 Becker thought it was going to be used in 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.349
 other contexts other than defensive 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.510
 inclusive becker being an avid 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.870
 camper and chef uses it to cook in 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.000
 much 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.860
 your videos the sheet has as it was 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.900
 wait for a clip or inter 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.000
 edged to ensure its ability to 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.220
 penetration the grinding is continuous 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.200
 for a more predictable use with only two 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.599
 tables but has a feature 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.489
 very special and it is the protection in the 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.470
 tenderloin at the beginning of the leaf that serves 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.540
 to locate the thumb and give it a lot 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.430
 precision so that the sheet of 7 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.890
 inches long it moves like a 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.810
 much shorter this leaf design was 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.640
 manufactured by Camilo and only in 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.769
 that time the blade had a room 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.810
 inch thick now reduced a 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.269
 little to three sixteenths of an inch 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.430
 something like 5 millimeters with that it 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.620
 He gained a lot of agility and speed due to 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.569
 that the design of the sheet did not change is not 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.849
 lost the structural integrity of the 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.130
 sheet with the decrease in thickness and it 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.370
 he kept the incredible utility sheet that 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.889
 is the material of the sheet is 1095 groban 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.080
 Chrome and vanadium help create more 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.360
 aggressive carbides which results in 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.820
 an excellent edge vanadium adds a 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 tremendous amount of mechanical strength and 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.229
 as a result we have a knife with 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.639
 excellent resistance and a capacity of 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.590
 provide unique edge 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.659
 as if the treatment was not enough 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.879
 He patented kmart always called 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.400
 Martin print and gives you a 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.259
 considerable amount of hardness and adds 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.779
 approximately 20 percent of 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.199
 resistance to 10 95 average 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:54.270
 maintaining 58 hrs to ensure the 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.219
 finished of the sheet is once again 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.710
 as in the whole baker series a 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.360
 epoxy of very high quality and is 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.699
 wait because usually these 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.099
 knives endure a deal that no 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.169
 other supports and the finished should be 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.879
 the height as in the whole series of 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.650
 beckham knives ergonomics is very 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.080
 basic but like most of 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.810
 successful designs the basis of your success 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.580
 is that simplicity and versatility 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.289
 mango has a very smooth texture and 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.150
 clean what in theory makes it difficult 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.129
 hold because whoever uses it must do 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.750
 greater effort to retain the knife 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.759
 in the hand but the head and the heel 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.039
 oversized prevent the 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.870
 knife comes out of your hand easily and 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.580
 it also helps when they are used 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.069
 gloves the knife feels just as 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.960
 comfortable it 's amazing how accurate it is 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.729
 using the relief of the spine of the leaf 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.740
 but it is to be expected because when aligning 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.180
 the thumb with the blade of the knife 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.490
 get the position 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.900
 and the most natural thing that exists what one 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.699
 he asks is why there is no more 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.740
 cutlery manufacturers that use 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.750
 this system in this knife is 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.639
 really essential the use of the 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.500
 dragonera not only to brandish it and 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.289
 fan the fate for the grip of 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.389
 hunter in the bec to 7 it is possible to use the 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.460
 Hunter's grip where the dragonera 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.800
 moors at the elbow while 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.110
 use the thumb phalange grip on the tip 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.699
 of the knife for delicate work what 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.590
 impressive ergonomics of this 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.750
 knife in relation to the general design 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.849
 is that it's incredibly easy to 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.740
 handle it for the size it has is 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.479
 only comparable to what was achieved 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.370
 with which to carry the spice 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.199
 you wonder all this deployment of 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.820
 force so that to deter the 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.710
 competition to try to make a 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.199
 knife that looks and feels so 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.000
 powerful as the bk 7b that in repeated 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.009
 sometimes said that everything 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.870
 designed he designed it because it was what 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.970
 I wanted for him and as we said in 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.680
 other occasions if we are looking 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.860
 who designs our knives 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.849
 we would always choose a camper 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.889
 survivor and cook that is 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.270
 easily the description of the majority 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.250
 from the friends of the land project 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.840
 adventure sees that you are a writer and 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.240
 he learned that work from his father 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.070
 according to him each phrase must say something and 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.110
 it has to be a simple phrase that 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.600
 philosophy transmits it in their designs and 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.250
 is clearly reflected in bec a-7 the 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.840
 Most campers seek a 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.110
 knife that does everything possibly 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.580
 the bk 7 is the one with the best level of 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.380
 combination of all those that we have 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.690
 revised especially considering 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.580
 its reduced price the place to know 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.380
 how long is the survival team 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.419
 that one has is the garden or the room 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.699
 your house once you are outdoors 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.010
 one must know how much you can press 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.350
 your team to know how close you can 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.790
 get there before he fails with the bk 7 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.770
 we suggest you do not waste your time 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.220
 it's just not going to fail many 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.220
 Thank you
