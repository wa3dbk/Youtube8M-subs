00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.560
 little girls or all the laces of 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.210
 states and this here is minecraft we 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.430
 we found a fashionable day you know that 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.350
 every day of the year here on the channel 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.950
 you have a fashion and religiously because 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.720
 yes um and good the truth that I always 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.550
 There is one of the questions that I have asked 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.589
 and it's because minecraft is so easy 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.810
 that does have a lot of many 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.929
 neutral enemies friends and others but 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.599
 but doing out is not complex is to say 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.179
 once you already know how they work 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.399
 the bugs kill them and others is easy not 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.010
 it is complicated to die in minecraft by 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.469
 bug and when you have a month of 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.199
 experience it's really hard to die 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.780
 by bug is not so complex anymore you die 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.789
 by falls that for something else not because 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.890
 you see a hole where there is no fall or 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.989
 in short but by attacks of zombies or a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.239
 herbal clip usually not 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.679
 you die is easy minecraft in order to 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.749
 accounts even if you put it in difficulty 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.480
 maximum so that they play more bugs not 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.370
 you die, it 's easy to play then 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.489
 the mod of today what he will bring is 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.589
 difficulty finally that without adding 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.330
 nothing new agreement is tell you what 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.080
 there is already added 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.250
 change things like for example 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 creepers that can be climbed on top of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.030
 bugs like we have right now here 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.650
 possibility of more creepers coming out 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.790
 charged like this one here that is 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.430
 loaded and on top of the slide what 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.710
 there may be up 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.080
 crippen over crippen over decline 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.060
 of three floors as much three floors worth 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.560
 more mods and all that appear and that's it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.750
 that out there now let's go with what 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.580
 next the clips can explode to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.650
 through walls what does that mean 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.120
 that if he found me we're going to go to 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.030
 people from this so that explain it of 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.830
 way a little simpler imagine by 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.510
 a simple fact that you are 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.640
 inside a house agree and there is a 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.470
 kripper on the other side out here in the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 street of agreement but you are seeing that 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.270
 through the glass it will approach and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 will explode and break your house and cut down 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.130
 harm to you in agreement is to say that you can 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.320
 explode through the walls the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.119
 blades the big ones and takes care of them 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.890
 skeleton are going to start is to piss in 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.680
 the real world agree nothing of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 Hernando in the real world gaps 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.310
 you will put in shoot balls more 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.630
 quickly it was worth before it was they did it very 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.510
 slow and now they will do much more 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.459
 quickly 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.989
 the clippers when they explode we're going to 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.220
 look for a group around here and we're going to 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.010
 popping so you see it a 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.480
 little the crepes when spain what 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.170
 will do is a kind of bomb 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.569
 fire worth look 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.180
 You see explode with fire you have 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.220
 visited is to say that if I put a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.220
 clipper here and we go with total 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.340
 It will almost leave you burning 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.710
 next point the beds are 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.570

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.310

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.860
 yes you will catch the point of istanbul in 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.460
 that aspect the bed will not fail but 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.220
 you will not be able to sleep better 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.080
 the zombies are going to affect the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.610
 players in cyl7 attacker are going to do 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.860
 hunger damage of agreement you will receive 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.500
 hurt by hunger an illness during 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.270
 10 seconds of agreement and also the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.220
 enter more will have side effects 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.620
 when they hit you and every time you 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.360
 attack when you finish art titles that are 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.850
 forward of transporting on your face is worth 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.740
 and also if you do not attack them equally 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.980
 if they are afraid to teleport in your 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.980
 face 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.060
 all the mods will be able to attack the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.250
 villagers all absolutely everyone what 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.920
 you see here the villagers suffering for 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.350
 fire showing them everything 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.470
 eggs with go for the villagers that's 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.600
 A little bitch, gift is worth the simple 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.230
 fact that man for his problems 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.750
 it has more difficulty to die very rich 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.519
 the zombies to be able to dig for 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.040
 to remove blocks according to 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.870
 to be able to reach you and have a more 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.190
 quick is to say that stone wall that 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.170
 you can at first because the zombies 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.690
 do not kill the zombies will be able to remove it 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.450
 without any kind of problem and then the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.190
 mods are going to try to evade your attacks and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.030
 if you ours that you attack will try 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.890
 that you do not deserve them now we're going to go 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.890

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.080

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.830

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.220
 well tells us a little about the 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.919
 boiled in a real hell what 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.220
 it means that as you see in the leader 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.650
 there are creepers on top of pickman there 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.720
 loaded flu there is everything here you go 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.740
 to go bad as you see there are many 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.300
 vices a gas two gas 34 gas 5 gas is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.460
 brutal the amount of bugs that goes to 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.020
 see is exaggerated the big man does not 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.970
 missing that the turn of attacks in when 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.740
 had they go for you according the 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.169

 tired flu go out a lot more than 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.259
 before and that's it, this is basically what 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.210
 that added difficulty to the beast but to 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.410
 the beast something more complex according 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.729
 this should exist in one's own 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.860
 minecraft because I would do it more 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.690
 fun the difficulty works out is 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.389
