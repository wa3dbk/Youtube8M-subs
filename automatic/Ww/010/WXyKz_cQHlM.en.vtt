00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
GT 720 projector which I just picked up

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.560 
GT 720 projector which I just picked up
for<00:00:08.910> under<00:00:09.179> 700<00:00:10.400> which<00:00:11.400> actually<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.240> got<00:00:12.420> on

a<00:00:15.809> great<00:00:16.020> deal<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.740> Optima<00:00:18.380> projector<00:00:19.380> which

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
a great deal for Optima projector which

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.439 
a great deal for Optima projector which
I've<00:00:19.650> heard<00:00:19.770> great<00:00:20.010> things<00:00:20.070> about<00:00:20.449> just

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
I've heard great things about just

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.810 
I've heard great things about just
because<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> throw<00:00:22.230> distance<00:00:22.670> which<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
because of the throw distance which I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.429 
because of the throw distance which I
really<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.600> my<00:00:24.750> small<00:00:25.050> room<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.320> got

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
really need for my small room I got

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
really need for my small room I got
about<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> 12<00:00:25.920> by<00:00:26.039> 12<00:00:26.070> room<00:00:26.609> which<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.000> have

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
about a 12 by 12 room which I have

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.840 
about a 12 by 12 room which I have
mentioned<00:00:27.720> earlier<00:00:29.269> and<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.660> need<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.850> short

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
mentioned earlier and I need that short

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.340 
mentioned earlier and I need that short
throw<00:00:33.030> distance<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.870> big<00:00:34.079> screen

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
throw distance to get that big screen

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
throw distance to get that big screen
from<00:00:34.820> very<00:00:35.820> short<00:00:35.880> distance<00:00:36.420> away<00:00:36.540> basically

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
from very short distance away basically

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
from very short distance away basically
throw<00:00:37.320> distance<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.860> means<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.030> have

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
throw distance just means you don't have

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
throw distance just means you don't have
to<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.360> very<00:00:39.480> far<00:00:39.780> away<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:41.370> screen<00:00:43.070> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to be very far away from the screen to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.660 
to be very far away from the screen to
get<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> nice<00:00:44.550> big<00:00:44.789> picture<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.960> think

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
get that nice big picture which I think

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
get that nice big picture which I think
the<00:00:47.670> throw<00:00:47.940> distance<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.570> throw<00:00:48.899> ratio

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the throw distance on this throw ratio

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
the throw distance on this throw ratio
is<00:00:49.879> about<00:00:50.879> 0.72<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.840> 1<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.649> very

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is about 0.72 to 1 so it's very very

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
is about 0.72 to 1 so it's very very
short<00:00:53.699> ultra<00:00:54.390> portable<00:00:54.570> projector<00:00:55.260> comes

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
short ultra portable projector comes

that but it doesn't really bother me too

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.780 
that but it doesn't really bother me too
much<00:02:23.150> which<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:23.750> means<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.230> can<00:02:24.670> shift<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
much which just means you can shift the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.840 
much which just means you can shift the
lens<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.330> down<00:02:26.980> which<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.700> have

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
lens up and down which here you you have

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.509 
lens up and down which here you you have
a<00:02:28.880> little<00:02:29.030> bit<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.269> functionality<00:02:30.019> with<00:02:30.140> that

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
a little bit of functionality with that

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.979 
a little bit of functionality with that
with<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.640> remote<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.330> move<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.750> or<00:02:32.930> down

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
with the remote you move it up or down

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.440 
with the remote you move it up or down
but<00:02:33.519> not<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.580> big<00:02:34.760> thing<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.000> me

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
but not a big thing for me

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.790 
but not a big thing for me
it<00:02:35.540> does<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.900> adjustable<00:02:36.350> feet<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
it does have adjustable feet on the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.400 
it does have adjustable feet on the
bottom<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:38.180> get<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.570> lift<00:02:39.340> comes<00:02:40.340> with<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:41.410> VGA

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
bottom to get that lift comes with a VGA

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.500 
bottom to get that lift comes with a VGA
to<00:02:42.769> component<00:02:43.580> cord<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.239> if<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.420> don't<00:02:44.570> have

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
to component cord so if you don't have

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.670 
to component cord so if you don't have
an<00:02:47.510> HDMI<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.410> come<00:02:48.590> into<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.570> then<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:51.110> use

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
an HDMI to come into it then you can use

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.809 
an HDMI to come into it then you can use
component<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:53.420> VGA<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.280> very<00:02:55.280> good<00:02:55.400> additions

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
component to VGA so very good additions

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.229 
component to VGA so very good additions
for<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.430> very<00:02:58.670> bright<00:02:58.910> room

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
for that but I have a very bright room

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.280 
for that but I have a very bright room
here<00:02:59.769> we've<00:03:00.769> got<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:00.890> turned<00:03:01.100> on<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.610> got<00:03:01.760> my<00:03:01.880> ps3

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
here we've got it turned on I got my ps3

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.520 
here we've got it turned on I got my ps3
on<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:04.040> very<00:03:04.519> bright<00:03:04.790> room<00:03:05.150> window

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
on it a very bright room window

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.069 
on it a very bright room window
I<00:03:06.590> believe<00:03:07.130> it's<00:03:07.390> 2500<00:03:08.390> lumens<00:03:08.570> which<00:03:08.930> is

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
I believe it's 2500 lumens which is

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.009 
I believe it's 2500 lumens which is
pretty<00:03:09.260> good<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:11.090> little<00:03:11.390> bit<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.630> ambient

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
pretty good so a little bit of ambient

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.259 
pretty good so a little bit of ambient
light<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:13.160> little<00:03:13.459> bit<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.730> sunlight<00:03:13.910> shining

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
light a little bit of sunlight shining

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.640 
light a little bit of sunlight shining
and<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.540> doesn't<00:03:14.810> really<00:03:14.900> affect<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.320> picture

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
and it doesn't really affect the picture

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.069 
and it doesn't really affect the picture
right<00:03:15.860> now<00:03:16.150> bright<00:03:17.150> light<00:03:17.390> right<00:03:17.600> directly

about ten feet away
right<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:06.360> projector<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:06.989> probably

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
right now the projector is probably

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.850 
right now the projector is probably
about<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.530> ninety<00:04:08.400> six<00:04:08.700> inch<00:04:08.879> screen<00:04:09.209> right<00:04:09.420> now

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
about a ninety six inch screen right now

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.440 
about a ninety six inch screen right now
so<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.099> that's<00:04:11.250> about<00:04:11.340> five<00:04:11.790> feet<00:04:12.030> from<00:04:12.299> the

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
so and that's about five feet from the
