own little filter here now this
rainwater<00:00:16.010> it<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.220> know<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.550> freshly

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
rainwater it you know it's just freshly

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.490 
rainwater it you know it's just freshly
collected<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:19.020> rainwater<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
collected and it was rainwater so I I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.080 
collected and it was rainwater so I I
don't<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.519> would<00:00:23.580> contain<00:00:23.910> any

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
don't know if it would contain any

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.630 
don't know if it would contain any
microbes<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.930> even<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.619> does<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.460> will

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
microbes but even if it does this will

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.429 
microbes but even if it does this will
be<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.210> grain<00:00:27.359> brew<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.869> it'll<00:00:28.109> get<00:00:28.230> boiled

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
be an all grain brew so it'll get boiled

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.730 
be an all grain brew so it'll get boiled
for<00:00:28.680> an<00:00:28.800> hour<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.449> figure<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
for an hour I figure I don't have to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740 
for an hour I figure I don't have to
worry<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.009> filtration<00:00:32.640> microbe<00:00:33.300> treatment

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
worry about filtration microbe treatment

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.889 
worry about filtration microbe treatment
because<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.020> will<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.320> boiling<00:00:34.559> them<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:35.899> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
because I will be boiling them out so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
because I will be boiling them out so
what<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> did<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.950> made<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.250> own<00:00:38.280> Oh<00:00:38.489> makes

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
what I did was I made my own Oh makes

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970 
what I did was I made my own Oh makes
you<00:00:38.850> filter<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> bottling<00:00:40.800> bucket

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you filter here it is a bottling bucket

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.910 
you filter here it is a bottling bucket
I<00:00:41.370> filled<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.420> polyester<00:00:43.050> batting<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I filled it with polyester batting and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.810 
I filled it with polyester batting and
put<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> big<00:00:45.180> washed<00:00:45.510> rock<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> it's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
put a big washed rock in it so it's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.369 
put a big washed rock in it so it's
completely<00:00:48.390> full<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> batting<00:00:50.300> then<00:00:51.379> I'm

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
completely full of batting then I'm

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
completely full of batting then I'm
going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.030> just<00:00:54.030> pour<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.989> water<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:57.329> see

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
going to just pour the water in and see

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
going to just pour the water in and see
if<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.109> comes<00:00:58.320> clean<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.890> spigot<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.609> have<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
if it comes clean out spigot I have a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.590 
if it comes clean out spigot I have a
feeling<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.870> probably<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
feeling it probably will this is one of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.740 
feeling it probably will this is one of
my<00:01:04.400> collections<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> rainwater<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.570> my

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
my collections of rainwater here in my

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.550 
my collections of rainwater here in my
old<00:01:06.950> Coleman<00:01:07.950> thermos<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.320> show<00:01:10.500> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
old Coleman thermos and I can show you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
old Coleman thermos and I can show you
that<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.790> i<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.900> i<00:01:13.049> take<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> lid

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that actually i think if i take the lid

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
that actually i think if i take the lid
off<00:01:15.439> filtering<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> rain<00:01:16.680> water<00:01:16.920> through<00:01:17.479> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
off filtering the rain water through you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
off filtering the rain water through you
can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.840> most<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> dirt<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> came<00:01:20.130> out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
can see most of the dirt that came out

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
can see most of the dirt that came out
of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> rain<00:01:20.790> water<00:01:21.030> actually<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.960> already

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of the rain water actually has already

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.580 
of the rain water actually has already
settled<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.680> bottom<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:25.560> i

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
settled to the bottom so you know i

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.690 
settled to the bottom so you know i
don't<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:25.920> there's<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.400> much

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
don't think there's going to be much

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.020 
don't think there's going to be much
problem<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.409> I've<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.560> my

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
problem with this and then I've got my

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
problem with this and then I've got my
mice<00:01:30.049> whatever<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.619> many

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
mice whatever that is how are many

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.340 
mice whatever that is how are many
gallons<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.540> giant<00:01:33.750> fermenter

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
gallons that is in that giant fermenter

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010 
gallons that is in that giant fermenter
over<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.790> that's<00:01:35.790> full<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> Alex<00:01:36.570> rainwater

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
over there that's full of Alex rainwater

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.660 
over there that's full of Alex rainwater
so<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> filter<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.290> through<00:01:40.290> my

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
so I'm going to filter this through my

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.640 
so I'm going to filter this through my
polyester<00:01:41.670> batting<00:01:44.360> bottling<00:01:45.360> bucket

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
polyester batting bottling bucket

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.410 
polyester batting bottling bucket
and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.590> will<00:01:50.710> go<00:01:50.860> from<00:01:51.010> there<00:01:51.420> straight

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and then it will go from there straight

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.120 
and then it will go from there straight
into<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:53.880> root<00:01:54.880> pot<00:01:55.650> so<00:01:56.650> let's<00:01:56.830> see<00:01:56.950> how<00:01:57.100> it

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
into the root pot so let's see how it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:18.420 
into the root pot so let's see how it
goes<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:16.920> think<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.100> pretty<00:02:18.250> good

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
goes there I think that's pretty good

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.880 
goes there I think that's pretty good
filtration<00:02:18.790> there<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.620> don't<00:02:20.620> see<00:02:20.770> any

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
filtration there I don't see any

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.030 
filtration there I don't see any
particles<00:02:21.370> or<00:02:21.550> anything<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.989> it's<00:02:23.590> all<00:02:23.770> soft

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
particles or anything and it's all soft

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.060 
particles or anything and it's all soft
grade<00:02:24.310> water<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.910> yeah<00:02:25.570> pitting<00:02:26.380> on<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.560> ph

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
grade water so yeah pitting on the ph

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.220 
grade water so yeah pitting on the ph
and<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.670> don't<00:02:28.360> know<00:02:28.480> about<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.780> middle<00:02:29.050> pocket

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and I don't know about the middle pocket

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.500 
and I don't know about the middle pocket
or<00:02:29.530> anything<00:02:29.770> else<00:02:30.209> hopefully<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.420> to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
or anything else hopefully it's going to

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.040 
or anything else hopefully it's going to
make<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.660> beer<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:34.270> while<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:34.750> draining

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
make a beer and while this is draining
