00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
a good start to the season but fully

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.420 
a good start to the season but fully
expect<00:05:00.669> them<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.940> pull<00:05:01.090> things<00:05:01.240> together<00:05:01.480> and

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
expect them to pull things together and

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.310 
expect them to pull things together and
and<00:05:03.430> hopefully<00:05:04.060> make<00:05:04.210> make<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> run<00:05:05.110> at<00:05:05.140> the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
and hopefully make make a run at the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.170 
and hopefully make make a run at the
playoffs<00:05:05.530> if<00:05:05.860> they<00:05:05.980> can<00:05:06.190> dug<00:05:06.760> themselves<00:05:06.910> a

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
playoffs if they can dug themselves a

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.420 
playoffs if they can dug themselves a
little<00:05:07.270> bit<00:05:07.480> of<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.660> hole<00:05:07.840> but<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.890> offense<00:05:09.280> is

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
little bit of a hole but that offense is

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.250 
little bit of a hole but that offense is
really<00:05:09.610> stout<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.390> defense<00:05:10.750> does<00:05:10.900> not<00:05:10.960> look

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
really stout the defense does not look

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.950 
really stout the defense does not look
great<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:12.430> hopefully<00:05:13.210> we<00:05:13.510> can<00:05:13.660> make<00:05:13.750> some

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
great so hopefully we can make some

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.170
