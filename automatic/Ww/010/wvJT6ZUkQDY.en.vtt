one now right yeah I was at first too

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
one now right yeah I was at first too
but<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> transform<00:01:47.880> until<00:01:48.150> one<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.840> consider

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
but I transform until one so I consider

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.250 
but I transform until one so I consider
myself<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.360> how<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.510> handle

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
myself at the one now how do you handle

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.630 
myself at the one now how do you handle
the<00:01:52.500> expectations<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.160> get<00:01:53.340> built<00:01:53.490> up

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the expectations that get built up

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.770 
the expectations that get built up
around<00:01:53.790> program<00:01:54.150> like<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.660> mean

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
around program like this I mean

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.040 
around program like this I mean
obviously<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.700> program<00:01:57.060> gotta<00:01:57.240> 4shared<00:01:57.750> NC

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
obviously this program gotta 4shared NC

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.330 
obviously this program gotta 4shared NC
tournaments<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.619> although<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.070> guys<00:01:59.190> are

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
tournaments and although you guys are

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.430 
tournaments and although you guys are
young<00:01:59.490> fans<00:01:59.940> will<00:02:00.570> probably<00:02:00.869> expect<00:02:01.170> nothing

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
young fans will probably expect nothing

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.280 
young fans will probably expect nothing
less<00:02:01.470> than<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.800> issue<00:02:02.150> is<00:02:03.150> i<00:02:03.720> like<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
less than that issue is i like it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.290 
less than that issue is i like it
because<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.770> means<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.220> they<00:02:05.850> put<00:02:06.030> us<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
because that means that they put us in a

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.419 
because that means that they put us in a
position<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.780> working<00:02:07.110> harder<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:08.250> as

from must place that's how our defense
yeah<00:03:32.879> this<00:03:33.449> is<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.829> we<00:03:34.829> can<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.010> kind<00:03:35.280> of

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
can say that i'm working on getting

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.180 
can say that i'm working on getting
better<00:03:45.000> i<00:03:45.419> can't<00:03:46.109> say<00:03:46.169> i'm<00:03:46.410> at<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> best<00:03:46.919> line

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
better i can't say i'm at the best line

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.460 
better i can't say i'm at the best line
of<00:03:47.310> defense<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.790> can<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.449> better<00:03:48.629> as<00:03:49.079> long<00:03:49.260> as<00:03:49.290> I

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
of defense I can do better as long as I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.289 
of defense I can do better as long as I
learn<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.739> technique<00:03:50.190> more<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:51.090> all<00:03:51.180> the

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
learn to technique more and all the

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.330 
learn to technique more and all the
principles<00:03:51.810> I'll<00:03:52.440> be<00:03:52.680> there<00:03:52.829> but<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.280> now

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
principles I'll be there but right now

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.819 
principles I'll be there but right now
i'm<00:03:53.669> quite<00:03:53.910> sure<00:03:53.940> i<00:03:54.419> feel<00:03:54.690> come<00:03:55.019> on<00:03:55.199> monday<00:03:55.379> so

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
i'm quite sure i feel come on monday so

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.439 
i'm quite sure i feel come on monday so
much<00:03:55.949> over<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.310> effort<00:03:56.699> and<00:03:56.970> then<00:03:57.269> also

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
much over this effort and then also

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.059 
much over this effort and then also
technique<00:03:58.049> i<00:03:58.230> mean<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.739> seems<00:03:58.980> like

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
technique i mean because it seems like

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.220 
technique i mean because it seems like
defends<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.579> lot<00:03:59.669> about<00:03:59.790> ever<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.660> defense<00:04:01.079> is

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
defends a lot about ever the defense is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.689 
defends a lot about ever the defense is
more<00:04:01.500> effort<00:04:01.889> than<00:04:01.919> technique<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.519> that's

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
more effort than technique and that's

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.580 
more effort than technique and that's
what<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.150> guess<00:04:03.419> a<00:04:03.449> lot<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.780> people<00:04:03.900> really

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
what I guess a lot of people really

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.659 
what I guess a lot of people really
probably<00:04:05.549> understand<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:07.160> if<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.489> go

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
probably understand but if you just go

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.420 
probably understand but if you just go
hard<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.139> just

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
hard and you just

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.059 
hard and you just
feeling<00:04:10.969> spots<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:11.569> things<00:04:11.829> your<00:04:12.829> technique

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
feeling spots and things your technique

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.890 
feeling spots and things your technique
can<00:04:13.280> be<00:04:13.310> off<00:04:13.609> sometimes<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.329> that<00:04:14.780> would

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
can be off sometimes but that would

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.590 
can be off sometimes but that would
always<00:04:15.230> on<00:04:15.439> help<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.220> out<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.880> it's<00:04:17.180> more<00:04:17.359> it's

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
always on help you out so it's more it's

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.240 
always on help you out so it's more it's
a<00:04:17.660> lot<00:04:17.810> more<00:04:17.840> effort<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.500> energy<00:04:18.769> than

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
a lot more effort and energy than

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.849 
a lot more effort and energy than
technique<00:04:19.820> when<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.329> comes<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.570> Defense<00:04:20.900> give

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
technique when it comes of Defense give

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.879 
technique when it comes of Defense give
us<00:04:22.009> a<00:04:22.100> scouting<00:04:22.370> report<00:04:22.550> on<00:04:23.050> yourself<00:04:24.050> all

any weaknesses he can work more on his
IQ<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.620> little<00:04:45.889> bit<00:04:46.009> more<00:04:46.190> or<00:04:46.550> his<00:04:46.849> his<00:04:47.750> decision

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
IQ a little bit more or his his decision

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.040 
IQ a little bit more or his his decision
making<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.650> little<00:04:48.770> bit<00:04:48.919> more<00:04:49.130> but<00:04:50.090> that's<00:04:50.960> the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
making a little bit more but that's the
