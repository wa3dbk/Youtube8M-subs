00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.990
 of something very new that I 'm taking today and they're 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.460
 hearing aids and urban years think'in 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.419
 as you can see there is the box and there it says and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.420
 urbanize and to show them what it says 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.730
 zinc in 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.490
 without a story meiro did not give me what 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.040
 want to call the color since they see that 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.140
 it's like a tomato color other can 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.500
 say it's a little pink but it 's because 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.500
 light and that and here they appear as the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.120
 the north east and you know when 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.280
 they will choose a color 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.629
 stay and turn around this appears what 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.400
 would be the the cable of the hearing aids 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.670
 double something called transkei 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 bow that you can change it for 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.880

 very dj heart and if we go to the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.299
 back side another image of 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.909
 hearing aids and things that are 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 like bringing the headphones in the subject 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.170
 in tribes that just talked to you 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.480
 also the sound that to share the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.190
 music that you are listening to 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.520
 this so that the hearing aids can be 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.520
 Bend 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.250
 this is guarantee 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.990
 the color of the cable 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.430
 the specific numbers 3.5 mm 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.880
 I do not know how that is said and the microphone 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.270
 what for iphone samsung cell phones 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.270
 blackberry 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.430
 two 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.600
 if we turn to the other side it appears what 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.680
 is the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:28.810
 after youth that is such a heart and 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:32.080
 well let's start by opening the face 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.340
 well let's start to open it in a box 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.340
 so it opens yes 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.250
 good 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.160
 and as you see here there is nothing and here it says 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:02.720
 the page here in nothing nothing nothing and then 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.370
 It puts you like this design 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.069
 it's something abstract 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.200
 then we open this 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:18.500
 and there the hearing aids appear 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:23.140
 Carlos, as you can see, here are the hearing aids 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.140
 there you can see what it says 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.770
 I'm not sure why I do not think the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.220
 camera detect very well that this is something 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.720
 solid 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.680
 stella 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.080
 Here we have how you can see that they are very 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.810
 very comfortable 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.819
 This is the same as leather 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.069
 pads 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.609
 the sound has recommended me very well 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.609
 a lot of sound and I've tried it 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.609
 charmed 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.170
 there you can see that there can be the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.610
 cable 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.030
 for 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:10.910
 stable is the big one of 6.3 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.910
 millimeters the 6.3 and here the 3.5's I think 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.709
 so let's go let's go on and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.800
 here the box appears 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:28.520
 then we open this and here we are going to 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.520
 appear what is 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.980
 the wire 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.990
 there you can see it 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.950
 the cable design is the same as the color 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.520
 of the tomato 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.630
 and has this elastic so that for 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.230
 stable be longer and at the same time 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.590
 short here we see that it is also of 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.590
 something 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.320
 I do not know what this is, I'm going to see 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.340

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.340
 for him 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.690

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:30.380
 and you can see it 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:36.210
 and if we keep opening this we can see 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:39.860
 which is a sticker of the logo of the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.860
