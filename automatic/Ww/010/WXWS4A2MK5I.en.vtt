00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
gonna want to make a cube and now with

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
gonna want to make a cube and now with
the<00:00:51.660> cube<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> sighs<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.340> however

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the cube you can just sighs it however

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.200 
the cube you can just sighs it however
you<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:55.190> I'm<00:00:56.190> gonna<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
make a sphere now you can do this with

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.359 
make a sphere now you can do this with
any<00:01:02.270> any<00:01:03.680> objects<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.250> it

any any objects I'm just going to do it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.250 
any any objects I'm just going to do it
with<00:01:05.460> these<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.840> come<00:01:07.080> out

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
with these two because they come out

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890 
with these two because they come out
really<00:01:07.290> nice<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.540> I'm<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
really nice and I'm just going to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359 
really nice and I'm just going to
increase<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> segments<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> sphere<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
increase the segments on the sphere a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.660 
increase the segments on the sphere a
bit<00:01:12.680> then<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
bit then what you're going to do is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
bit then what you're going to do is
right<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> click<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> here

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
right here you're going to click on here

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060 
right here you're going to click on here
and<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> pool<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:19.950> you're

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and go to pool and then what you're

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.710 
and go to pool and then what you're
going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> dragging<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> sphere<00:01:21.420> first

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going to do is dragging the sphere first

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
going to do is dragging the sphere first
and<00:01:22.549> then<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.000> cube<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and then the cube so what it does is it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.630 
and then the cube so what it does is it
makes<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.520> sphere<00:01:26.759> kind<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> an<00:01:27.450> indent<00:01:28.409> on

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
makes the sphere kind of an indent on

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.719 
makes the sphere kind of an indent on
the<00:01:29.640> cube<00:01:30.270> itself<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.250> remove

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the cube itself so you can just remove

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
the cube itself so you can just remove
the<00:01:32.790> sphere<00:01:33.150> around<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.570> any<00:01:33.750> anyway<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the sphere around in any anyway and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.010 
the sphere around in any anyway and
let's<00:01:35.250> say<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> make<00:01:36.150> kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.750> weird

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
let's say you want to make kind of weird

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
let's say you want to make kind of weird
edges<00:01:38.060> or<00:01:39.060> something<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.869> see<00:01:42.869> like

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
edges or something you can just see like

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.730 
edges or something you can just see like
that<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:44.689> like<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.810> nice<00:01:49.200> kind

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that or like this it just as a nice kind

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.710 
that or like this it just as a nice kind
of<00:01:49.920> effect<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.909> general<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
of effect in general and you can do a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.710 
of effect in general and you can do a
lot<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.259> such<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.310> modeling<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.390> stuff

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
lot with this such as modeling and stuff

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.280 
lot with this such as modeling and stuff
like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.219> but<00:01:56.219> yeah<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.909> pretty<00:01:57.119> much<00:01:57.390> all
