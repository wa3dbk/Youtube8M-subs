 nothing else on the internet they think they are not going to 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.590

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.660
 l'aquila folder bar and in the folder 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.190
 mobile 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.410
 after here it's not going to happen 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.030
 folders this in this case I believe her 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.970

 enter it enter the logo where 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.480
 they downloaded their game in this case I 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.220
 like what it is downloads and 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.080
 you can only drag it 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.970

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.230
 nothing else you put here in the bar 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.210
 bottom that will show them the breakthrough 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.130
