there called on site we've built in our
own<00:00:18.750> server<00:00:19.109> controls<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.820> appreciate

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
own server controls so we appreciate

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.300

really how difficult and fiddly setting
up<00:00:23.460> servers<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.590> simplicity

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

in<00:00:26.490> itself<00:00:26.789> start<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.930> stop<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
in itself start and stop so you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.740 
in itself start and stop so you
shouldn't<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.539> too<00:00:30.660> many
