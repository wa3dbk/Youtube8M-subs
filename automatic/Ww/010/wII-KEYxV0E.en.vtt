00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi guys is that blog from Amanda brought 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 night and today I came to do a video review 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.259
 about a book everyone's talking about 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.610
 everything as then what is this here and is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.260
 good 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 Before I speak a little bit here 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.800
 story is just to make it light 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.619
 So it's for those who do not know it's on the blog. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 posted me and lu and I already have one 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 divergent gift made by including 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 if you are watching on youtube it is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.610
 clicking on the link will be in the same post 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.640
 and I'm going to check it out and have a look 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.360
 cool see the different on the same 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.960
 thing 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.270
 He's in business so there's the tip. 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.870
 is to leave the blog address down there 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.739
 Now, going back to what matters is good. 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.690
 this here is a huawei dystopia and here 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.210
 in this history the society divided in 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.760
 five factions that are they are a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.350
 franchise franchise delegation and audacity 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 good people living these factions 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.750
 have as characteristic so is the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.799
 main problem is very strong of your 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.350
 personality 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.420
 the main feature of this faction 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.640
 or if you are blunt you only 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 Speak truth if you are of denial you are 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.250
 extremely to 3 to 1 and so goes 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.380
 the story is told by the beatriz is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 wrong from her point of view and she 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.070
 He was born in the delegation and here in this 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.590
 when you turn 16 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.900
 Do you take an aptitude test? 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.710
 tell which fax is right for you 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.960
 price is not personalities and actress is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.409
 test and something happens 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.460
 different in her test because the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.259
 result of that is divergent is what 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.840
 happens in fact is that each phase of the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.969
 test eliminates a faction and then at the end 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.439
 it was not easy to perceive a faction that 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.439
 It's the faction that you 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.480
 It happens that it happens that 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.320
 three factions remain 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.840
 so then it's not the bag there 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.360
 tori said that they make her apply 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.510
 the test says that it is divergent and that it 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.600
 You can not tell this to anyone and that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.100
 This is super dangerous and she does not know 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.140
 exactly what it means to be 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.310
 divergent but she knows it is dangerous and 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.200
 that she does not have to stay with her mouth 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.350
 Closed, I can not tell anyone. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.270
 Good, she ends up in this doubt. 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 Cindy and I do not know if I stay in my 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.850
 faction your world because if it if it 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 chooses for another faction is means 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.510
 let the family leave their friends behind 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.950
 huh 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.520
 but at the same time does not feel 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.700
 completely part of the navigation in the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.740
 mexico she does the things she was born 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.600
 there and have to do not because she feels 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.810
 that it is concluded and that it 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.540
 making know things like that then it is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.060
 kind of what happens in conflict 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.700
 Yes, and then I 'll talk more because otherwise 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.650
 will end the expointer 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.390
 but I really liked the book I found 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.000
 very cool, I really liked the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.880
 book couple on the 4 track 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 when they are really cool chemistry 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.700
 and I really enjoyed the narrative is very 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.760
 Fluid type, you spent an afternoon reading 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.820
 One night, and you do not even know. 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.180
 so it is very fluent and I liked it very much 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.640
 it's a whole but a lot of people compare 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.150
 with the ravenous games and can not 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.060
 compare with the schedules because so to the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.770
 same context and young people and although 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.540
 be completely different 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.820
 I liked more ravenous games than 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.880
 divergent from one of them are as in 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.950
 reservation I do not remember but I like to see more 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.130
 but I found the history of both 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.410
 more and better built than 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.140
 I do not know this one does not depend on with 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.030
 the proceedings the thing came from a 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.709
 better way 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.790
 but I still really liked the 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.850
 I thought it was cool, I really liked the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.310
 Personal sadness of paula network is not 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.670
 little girl 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:18.320
 had been right you're not going to take anything 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.730
 is to put a stranger that she comes 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.530
 decided and I know very strong is the 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.630
 you're still going to be so he would have 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.100
 been cool it reinforces that you but 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.669
 fact is that there is no crisis has this thing 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.180
 I do not think he plays but I liked him more. 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.550
 floor than 500 but he's really cool and 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.230
 so I found the characters all 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.780
 that's how they got it all very well 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.310
 I paid tribute to his theater. 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.280
 well built so you can see 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.610
 more sides of their personality 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.760
 other law and so are they but not 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.860
 Then there are two months, so it's more than 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.780
 six times that draw my attention 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.639
 It's also a character I think AndrÃ© 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.150
 eric if I'm not mistaken because you have 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:06.760
 so I loved it, I thought it was fine 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.760
 cool this first new adin ash it 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.060
 I like so're villains 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:18.350
 Anyway, I really liked the forum too. 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:22.789
 because he is not that character so 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.430
 kind of like he's a personality 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.919
 cool so do not talk too much because you do not 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.470
 I want to give out too can without 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.940
 I want to but I liked the book a lot 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.610
 will be quite cool Testoni found 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.010
 I think it's like this, I've missed it. 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.760
 develop a lot but I think 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.010
 This is for the next book so I 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.330
 I do not think that the others will leave the 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.710
 goose so you can see that you still have 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.740
 a lot to happen 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.460
 if you finish without a face it will not 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.630
 a lot of things have been happening so far 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.350
 although one thing I do not 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.419
 I liked it the end, I will not talk at all. 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.310
 but at the end the end of this level 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.460
 do not make me desperate for 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.050
 next month that I like I do not know if 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.150
 You know the question but I like to stay. 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.820
 desperate is continuation 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.560
 when technology or series and it does not 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.110
 happened in this one even though you 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.760
 finish 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.260
 knowing that there is still plenty of water to 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.310
 roll still has a lot to 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.790
 really happen 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.430
 I hope I'm not even the other one. 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.470
 but he did not leave me without no end. 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.300
 left me thus with this need to 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.430
 read the next 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.690
 so much so that here is on my shelf a 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.120
 drone 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.770
 but I really liked it, I think it's worth it 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.990
 If you liked ravenous games, you 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.180
 you will probably like divergent 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.950
 halo like it more 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.870
 I said I said that she likes it more 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.690
 fun than ravenous games 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.570
 I do not but it's very good, very cool. 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:51.960
 Very good storytelling helps a lot 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.140
 so that what they learn and live 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.880
 holds you from beginning to end is are you have 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.320
 always something going on you 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.230
 who always knows what's going to happen 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.420
 then you run out of connection and it's 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.900
 very good, I did not like it very much and I 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.840
 I recommend it to anyone who likes this genre and 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.410
 I think everything I found it all in the dose 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.180
 some romance as an action to know 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.580
 All right, tempered. Teaching right dose. 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.890
 It's not much, it's too far, and it has to 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.380
 focus on the case the whole time but 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:27.960
 same time it only has a better focus 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:29.220
 them and at the same time is not only kind not 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.410
 It's just something that has to happen to us. 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.860
 you know that well-tempered problems in this 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:38.610
 there meaning many characters of the case 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:44.310
 especially I hope you guys 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:48.900
 I like the video and the book and leave 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:52.020
 comments and suggestions do you feel 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.060
 free to debate about the faith it seems 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.920
 We're here, I'm going to leave it at 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.600
 blog for those who want to follow because 

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.690
 also because youtube does not want your blog 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.160
 who wants to follow the blog link is 

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:06.410
 I hope that you guys have 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.410
 liked and until the next
