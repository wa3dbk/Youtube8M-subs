00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 this is the new blackberry z10 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.330
 powered by the new operating system 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.360
 blackberry 10 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.300
 first of all the first thing that can be done 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.090
 note that the phone has no keys 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.430
 the interface has been designed for this purpose 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.860
 to give full control to the user 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.109
 and therefore from the moment I go 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.359
 to wake up to wake up from standby 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.850
 the phone I full control of that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.250
 which I'm going to do so I'm in 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.340
 waking up the phone is with one 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.739
 simple gesture I can get to one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.409
 page that shows me the applications 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.280
 right now open in the phone there 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:46.729
 then are the other pages where I find the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.360
 various applications installed on the 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:54.199
 phone is something to note that therefore 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.690
 I can open the various applications 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 always close them with a simple gesture 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.190
 it is important to consider that we have 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.040
 chosen to give maximum space to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.259
 application content so it is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.960
 possible at the time I go to 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.490
 open them 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.400
 have the application in full screen 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.810
 but I can always have full control 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.540
 of the interface and for example I can with 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.060
 this gesture quickly or go to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.619
 simply see the time or in the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.020
 moment when maybe he was saying a new one 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.509
 message check what are the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 notifications related to the message I have 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.649
 received I may have received a new one 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.390
 email could receive a message on 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.619
 facebook and so on 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.630
 always with full control I can go 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.090
 precisely to not only take a look but 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.330
 if there is something that interests me with a 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.649
 simple gesture I can take a look 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.130
 inside the hard blackberry that is 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.429
 practically the place where all the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.100
 message all my activities around 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.860
 to my contacts take place and therefore 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.450
 I can quickly give 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.700
 take a look or i can complete the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.280
 gesture and enter the reality show 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 and for iab actually right now 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.100
 I'm on the email but the blackberry app 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.019
 contains different types of messages 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.390
 so I can have a view that includes 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.120
 all kinds of messages or I can 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.769
 I'm going to move directly on 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.570
 twitter are on facebook 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.480
 I can see my private messages 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.790
 I can see friend requests e 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.610
 I can directly from the blackberry has ad 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.380
 example do an update or status 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.410
 on facebook or respond to 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.470
 friend request 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.240
 and so on the blackberry app is a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.040
 section that always accessible in 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.020
 any time the device can 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.690
 be on an application page 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.820
 but quickly I can access the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.710
 blackberry needle rather than person 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.350
 be inside an application but the 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.110
 blackberry ab always at the distance of a 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.820
 simple gesture that quickly me 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.920
 then allows you to interact with mine 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.900
 messages there are a whole series of 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.970
 innovative features have not been 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.750
 brought into the device ad 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.650
 example one is the one that allowed us 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.020
 to become famous over the years therefore 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.290
 Blackberry has always been known for 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.300
 the goodness of their own keyboards 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.090
 devices we wanted to keep the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.560
 same philosophy even on a keyboard 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.420
 virtual so for example the keyboard is 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.640
 a keyboard that allows so 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.470
 easy to predict what I am going to 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.040
 write like this writes for example hello 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.410
 how are you as you see already above the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.760
 I already find a suggestion of the word 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.600
 that I can directly with a gesture 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.890
 launch on the screen then write 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.810
 as already on the m predicts me how are you 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.190
 already apple tree suggests without even 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.260
 that the banks then carola or 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.810
 quickly the more I use the device 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.300
 that device learns from my way 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.510
 to write rivers will suggest words that 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.400
 are that they are appropriate to the context 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.860
 at the same time that I could also like 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.830
 as it happens to me to write in multiple languages 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.359
 I don't need to make a difficult of 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.340
 change from one language to another but the 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.799
 its array can handle multiple languages 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.200
 simultaneously then describe is 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:28.480
 we do suggest it awa ly ​​mou out 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.150
 I'm not suggesting orange suggests 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.970
 you digest because a sentence anyway 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.390
 quite common the more I use it the more 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.150
 learns more will happen to me words than 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.919
 are appropriate around the page 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.910
 of applications where among other things 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.770
 I note that these these these 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.539
 frames that we call active frames 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.890
 can be changed 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.130
 from the application then the application 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.289
 will be able to decide what to show to 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.870
 example in the calendar 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.400
 if I closed the calendar by 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.919
 calendasco matically decides to 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.950
 show me the last next appointment 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.950
 that I had to go to which I will have 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.640
 another interesting thing to show e 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.860
 and the ability to have both their own 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.210
 let's say one's working life 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.130
 be it one's personal life 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.900
 within the same device that 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.150
 the only device that allows me to 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.500
 manage both and therefore may have 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.900
 a partition dedicated to work then 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.730
 where is my company maybe it will do me 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.380
 install business applications that 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.120
 totally separate to the personal area 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.660
 what we call blackberry 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.100
 balance 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.950
 right now I 'm on my area 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.770
 staff with a simple gesture I can 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.710
 make the choice appear and I can move 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.070
 on the working part then how 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.430
 see all things are changed and I will have 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:58.840
 my my work and everything 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.940
 without going to intersect with col 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.710
 personal context this will also have to 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.240
 say that the moment I go to 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.880
 decide maybe I'll leave the company 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.860
 the company can safely 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.660
 cancel the perimeter for work 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.350
 and my perimeter instead each area 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:18.380
 staff will remain intact and continue 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:22.430
 another feature we have 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:25.700
 introduced on the blackberry z10 is the 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.720
 blackberry township the qualities in the city 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.430
 is a technology that allows me to 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.350
 maximize to improve 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.560
 performance of my camera in the 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.130
 meaning that here you can see that I have the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.620
 traditional camera or later 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.020
 Camera and times or ship the Room 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.960
 time shift allows me to do 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.450
 photos and when there were more 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.750
 faces within the same photo is 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.000
 You can go to select 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.730
 different faces independently and 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.230
 find the best time 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.940
 the best expression I want 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.430
 insert inside the fota we do 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.710
 an example of children who may be 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.970
 pottery in the photo of five children e 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.660
 clear that children move 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.970
 they smile play it is possible to do the 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.350
 photo is for every single child I will be able to 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.200
 subsidize the face and find the 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.240
 best time maybe coming back 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.980
 each of the children is clear that the 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.020
 final result will be an image that 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.080
 in time it never existed but that I 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.169
 I was able to create thanks to this technique 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.169
 Yup
