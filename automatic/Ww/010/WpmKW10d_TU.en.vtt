00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:13.820
 Greetings and welcome to Earthling Cinema. I am your host, Garyx Wormuloid. The object of 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.860
 this week is Frozen, which has won an Acadamy Award for the top hit "Let It Be" 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.880
 from The Beatles. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.540
 In the film we follow a princess who suffers from a rare human condition called Inexplicable 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.530
 Mutated Ice Forces. Her name is Elsa, but it could just as well have been Milkshake because she 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.870
 gives her sister Anna a brainfreeze. 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.899
 Their parents take Anna to the emergency room for lobotomy. Elsa is concerned that the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.999
 lobotomy might be contagious, so she hides in her room for the rest of the decade. 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.079
 Convinced that they have raised their children well without any form of school 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 or social interaction, the parents go on vacation and die. And after waiting three years and doing nothing 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.999
 in a kingdom ruled by no one, Elsa becomes queen, but her name just had 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.609
 so good Queen Milkshake can be because she brings all the boys to her garden. Anna meets a prince 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.220
 named Hans, and they decide to get married after two conversations, which is their good right 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.480
 as heterosexuals, Anna asks Elsa to keep the date free, but she refuses. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.370
 To prevent someone from calling her Milkshake again, Elsa walks away. She builds 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.850
 a new castle for herself with Airco and let the country be snowed under forever. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.150
 In any case, Anna still meets an average attractive age 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.840
 suitable boy named Kristoff, who agrees to risk his life to take her up the mountain 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 in exchange for a carrot. Along the way they meet Olaf, Elsa's illegitimate son, who 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.130
 show them the way to Elsa's castle. 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.760
 Anna asks Elsa to come back, which is in fact Elsa's biggest irritation, so she zaps Anna again 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.190
 and let her new boyfriend kick out proverbially. Kristoff takes Anna 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 back to the emergency room, where a standby doctor declares that Anna's heart 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.280
 is frozen with a capital B, and it can only thaw by an "act of true love", such as 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.270
 when someone doesn't throw away this month's Quarks Illustrated before you take it out 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:13.360
 Karen. Kristoff leaves Anna at home so that Hans can give her a little C12H22O11. 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 But Hans doesn't want to give her anything because of the lice. It appears that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.540
 he is the bad guy and just wants to be the king, so he locks up Elsa for treason and Anna for 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.500
 symmetry. Olaf helps Anna escape and tells her to kiss Kristoff, since kissing 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.420
 the only thing she is good for. She thought "it doesn't matter" but then she sees Elsa 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.720
 problems, so she performed an "act of true love" on her, and not in the dirty way Karen. 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.190
 And just like Huey Lewis, Elsa realizes the power of love, which suddenly enables her 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.090
 turning back the winter and proving once and for all that it is hip to be the odd one out. 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.239
 Frozen is a musical about the dueling qualities of the two most loved elements on earth, 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.790
 a song about ice and fire, if you want. Oh well, I wouldn't know why not. Anna is becoming 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.069
 associated with fire that indicates warmth and passion. She has fiery red hair and freckles 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.709
 or sunspots on her shoulders that she should have checked for certainty. They 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.630
 uses fire as a weapon against the horses. When Hans revealed to Anna that he was her alone 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.540
 but for her sincerity, he extinguished the fire and with that he extinguishes the passion that Anna had 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.770
 for him. 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.680
 Elsa is associated with ice cream, she is cold and rational and thinks it is the answer to life 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.470
 is to inhibit her feelings and on our planet she wouldn't be wrong either because of feelings 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.700
 the death penalty stands. She isolates herself, exchanging her traditional robe for a revealing one 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.250
 tight-fitting, transparent dress, all with a small budget. It suggests liberation 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.760
 maybe even sexual liberation, but at what price? 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.290
 Only by embracing her sister's love can Elsa find satisfaction in her life 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.390
 and happiness that only comes with social solidarity or a good piece of chocolate. The film 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.629
 seems to suggest that independence is a mistake, similar to Disney's 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.910
 mass culture. All people need a connection, so one 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.660
 solitary person is seen as incomplete and must be "made". Like the medical staff 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.959
 said, "We need each other to fix ourselves and complete". Easy for it to say 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.169
 they are already around. 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.210
 Frozen, on the other hand, is progressive in the sense that the heroic redemption comes in the form of 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.710
 sister love instead of a prince or a frog or whatever. The saying: "Love 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.210
 at first sight "is proven by Hans to be insignificant and misplaced 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.030
 just like Karen. And even with a promising admirer such as Kristoff, there is still no question of one 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.350
 wedding. They look soft. Mmm, so softly. Supplementary to convervative messages 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.740
 the door another recurring motive, something that people use when they are too tired to move on 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.820
 to slide through walls. At the start of the film, the two princesses are stuck in a closed kingdom 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.510
 gates. And of course there is the door that separates the sisters during their strangely impassive 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.020
 youth. As soon as she becomes the homeowner, Elsa brags about how she will handle legal advisors. 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.300
 Anna later asks her to do the opposite. 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.680
 One of the last sentences of the film is "I love the open gates, we will never go again 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.050
 The subtext is clear here: Elsa will no longer exclude her sister and it 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.290
 kingdom will be vulnerable to attack forever. This was Garyx Wormuloid for Earthling Cinema.
