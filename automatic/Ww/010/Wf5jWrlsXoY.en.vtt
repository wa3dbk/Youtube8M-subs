00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hey, how are you? I'm fine with you today. 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 I came to talk about the product on the internet 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.000
 that promises to grow hair 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 accelerate hair growth 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 this product grows so does the shampoo 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.969
 the mask and has several others 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 produtinhos only in the case only have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.070
 champagne the mask and this product here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.710
 is made in the Dominican Republic is then 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.529
 he calls grows by the comus and alone and not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 there are the ones we used to write normal, right? 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 and it is a physiotherapeutic treatment 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 which consists of the use of natural plants 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.829
 for hair growth is here 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.290
 back here he has a way 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.010
 innovative with extracts and active 100% 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.350
 natural resources needed for good 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 here in front speak conditions mec 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 to repair your visibility made good 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.140
 my impressions 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 I think we talk about a product 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 We have at least using the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.039
 product a long time ago I'm all 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.879
 in this product here for more or less 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.500
 month 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.780
 And yes, I noticed that he helped 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 Grow hair, I'll leave it to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 here you are seeing right now 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.460
 that's how my hair was before 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.299
 achieve this photo're here is I dye 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 hair dyed hair fifteen fifteen 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.630
 January and here is today showing the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.080
 root is about an inch 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 root rock and for me this is enough 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 because because my hair grows slowly 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.189
 It's clear that so your hair grows 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.740
 a mixture of several things including 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
 good food eat vegetables like 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.409
 fruits and healthy guaruba including 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.090
 physical exercise including a routine of 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.960
 good life and not if you are a person 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.640
 sedentary and how all wrong and that goes 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.100
 to reflect on your hair then understood 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.390
 shampoo just for him will not do miracle 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 ok then ok 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 What I think of shampoo it really 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.140
 When you pass, you have super hair. 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.860
 soft and you feel when you take it 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.920
 so the thread gets stronger but 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.160
 it seems that he is more the word peace 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.440
 sealed knows he gets the best of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.330
 do not pass the hand like that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.460
 being felt and brittle and sat 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.830
 feel at least for me that he gave 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.870
 A force in my son is your lava. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.970
 hair every day but with shampoo here I 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.100
 I do not need to wash everyday 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.200
 It's now taking me because it's too much. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.870
 heat but when it's not too hot I 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.610
 did not need the root does not get oily 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.650
 unlike before I took all 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.390
 day that risks very oily so I 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 I noticed that he also controls the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.860
 movie unit is only is as follows 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 this shampoo by itself 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.580
 if you do not use a good conditioner 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.580
 after him the gun hair looks like 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.470
 one puxeta because he is very strong 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.180
 stop and he's very strong so it's 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.350
 You need to have a good time. 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.350
 conditioner 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.600
 or you also use here if 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.820
 this one here the mask comes written that 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.000
 You should leave 15 minutes in your hair. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.130
 here comes the big question helps to grow 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.770
 I think the mask does not help 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.540
 Grow up to clean something. 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.060
 even it 's nice 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.620
 okay you take care of the wire and such but 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.800
 Pass the cream in case I step here 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.920
 down the sea ​​already grown wire goes 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.310
 help keep beautiful hydrated silky 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.870
 It's going to help not to leave a message. 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.010
 because the shampoo does leave a little bit 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.830
 resected 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 so it will help but grow the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.160
 hair I do not know if here really 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.110
 helped to grow 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.120
 I so in my opinion I can not 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.470
 say if it helped to grow because 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.690
 At this time I'm using the same 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.610
 here's a three times I use it 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.320
 as a moisturizing mask 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.810
 so I spend and so every 15 days 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.700
 once a week just understood this one 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.950
 not this one, it's written that you have 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.320
 that using at least three months is 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.380
 start to make some effect so I 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.780
 I have the right quarterback all day. 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
 yes day no case and wash your hair day 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.709
 yes, no, no 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.070
 so I quite liked the shampoo that 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.080
 although I left him a little bit 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.570
 resected I realized that he rescued 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.700
 movie although I leave a message I do not know 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.310
 how to explain this but so can 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.979
 repair my old videos like tava 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.600
 so the very aspect of the end of my 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.979
 hair knows it was much better 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.870
 happy now no 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.330
 besides being a little lower and 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.240
 so you avoid more silky and you see that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.729
 the best- kept filter understood and yes 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.620
 I think it was because of the shampoo and 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.979
 comparing the same one of chile there in the video 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.930
 for you to see my root is that it had 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.270
 painted on January 15th 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.650
 a month ago I painted what I'm painting 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.919
 I've been using this type for a month. 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.510
 here is already an effect because in two 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.640
 months to my holy root, nor to 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.099
 half of what was in that root video 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.380
 and now also in the middle is very large 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.560
 already grew more than one centimeter 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.930
 so yes I think it was because of 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.099
 shampoo if even I can not say 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.229
 that it was because of food because 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.849
 This is a month I used the shampoo I 'm 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.770
 living in sao paulo then also in 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.780
 however also at night really like 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.789
 a natural evening snack but a 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.099
 food so good 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.410
 so I think I have a diet 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.450
 Our great one knows to do some 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.830
 difference to my hair grow 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.840
 so in my opinion shampoo mask 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.300
 great chanco actually strengthen my 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.390
 hair and it helped in the growth but expensive 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.140
 Great, I recommend a lot of the mask. 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.510
 shampoo 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.030
 the price was a bit healthy I bought in 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.729
 free market these two here was 60 and 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.440
 with freight and eighty reais what is 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.470
 pretty salty, right? 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.050
 for someone who was there I was accustomed 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.140
 I use the same shampoo as well 20 reais in 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.770
 maximum these two here come out 80 reais 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.750
 so it's very expensive and the mask she is like this 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.520
 How did you tell the network a lot? 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.080
 You can never put your hand in it. 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.190
 inside the mask because it goes 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.260
 making her lose her chances 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.360
 so I'll get you a little spoonful 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.000
 spoonful of plastic tea, right? 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.220
 that the pec already gives so is from here to here the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.440
 my whole hair is very consistent 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.250
 You know, it's very thick. 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.780
 hair 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.270
 That's it folks if you're thinking 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.760
 in something that helps to grow hair that 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.890
 will leave strong your recommends but that 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.400
 the shampoo this is not an advertisement is 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.840
 making it clear and then this 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.279
 If you liked this video, do not 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.289
 forget to evaluate because it is very 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.080
 important for me it's good to leave your 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.909
 game down here if you want 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.909
 It's a specific makeup video. 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:39.919
 hair tips of something can leave 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.439
 that the comments are good too 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.949
 a super kiss and until the next video 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.949
 bye Bye
