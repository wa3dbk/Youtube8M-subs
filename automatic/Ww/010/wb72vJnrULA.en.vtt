00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
useful at the beginning of the game now

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.540 
useful at the beginning of the game now
what<00:00:36.840> jang-soo<00:00:37.230> thing<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.040> obviously<00:00:38.399> see

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
what jang-soo thing is you obviously see

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.740 
what jang-soo thing is you obviously see
me<00:00:38.670> doing<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> background<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> moment

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
me doing in the background the moment

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.299 
me doing in the background the moment
but<00:00:39.809> let<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:39.989> explain<00:00:40.140> basically<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.129> do

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
but let me explain basically what you do

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.619 
but let me explain basically what you do
you<00:00:41.550> report<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> requires<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> have

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you report this requires you to have

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.690 
you report this requires you to have
stim<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.739> tactical<00:00:44.070> ability<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
stim so that is your tactical ability so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.160 
stim so that is your tactical ability so
for<00:00:44.879> cloak<00:00:45.030> users<00:00:45.329> out<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.480> you're<00:00:46.079> going

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
for cloak users out there you're going

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
for cloak users out there you're going
to<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> swap<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to want to swap it out and what you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
to want to swap it out and what you
basically<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.300> after<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.230> run<00:00:49.440> with

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
basically do is after you will run with

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.910 
basically do is after you will run with
stim<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.730> use<00:00:51.420> jumps<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.230> maintain<00:00:52.800> your

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
stim you then use jumps to maintain your

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.439 
stim you then use jumps to maintain your
momentum<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.640> allows<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.329> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
momentum and it allows you to kind of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.569 
momentum and it allows you to kind of
carry<00:00:54.719> yourself<00:00:55.140> forward<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:56.399> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
carry yourself forward I really really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.430 
carry yourself forward I really really
fast<00:00:56.789> pace<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> imagine<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
fast pace so if you imagine or if you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.229 
fast pace so if you imagine or if you
kind<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.070> refer<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> hip<00:01:00.090> idea

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
kind of see I refer back to the hip idea

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.540 
kind of see I refer back to the hip idea
beginning<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.930> Nexus<00:01:01.410> rather<00:01:02.100> being<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
beginning on Nexus rather being in the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
beginning on Nexus rather being in the
game<00:01:02.699> I'm<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> spawn<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.229> stim<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
game I'm right off the spawn I stim I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
game I'm right off the spawn I stim I
sprint<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.850> run<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> after<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
sprint I will run and after that I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660 
sprint I will run and after that I
jumped<00:01:07.470> every<00:01:07.590> single<00:01:08.130> time<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> hit<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
jumped every single time I hit the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.640 
jumped every single time I hit the
ground<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.750> move<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.439> fast

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
ground and I can move really really fast

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.109 
ground and I can move really really fast
so<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> imagine<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.369> typically<00:01:11.909> your

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
so if you imagine that typically your

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
so if you imagine that typically your
enemy<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.540> assume<00:01:12.840> you'll<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.740> X

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
enemy will assume you'll be at X

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
enemy will assume you'll be at X
location<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:15.060> you've<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
location by the time you've kind of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.969 
location by the time you've kind of
moved<00:01:15.630> forward<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.140> spawn<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.830> can

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
moved forward out your spawn you can

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:17.960 
moved forward out your spawn you can
obviously<00:01:17.040> get<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> drop<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.820> because

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
obviously get the drop on them because

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
obviously get the drop on them because
you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.330> move<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.840> faster<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.500> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you can move a lot faster and you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.350 
you can move a lot faster and you can
get<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.460> much<00:01:20.640> quicker<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.180> means

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
get there that much quicker which means

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.820 
get there that much quicker which means
you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.630> obviously<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.200> vantage<00:01:22.439> point

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you can obviously get your vantage point

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.440 
you can obviously get your vantage point
or<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.250> behind<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.330> if

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
or you can get behind them you know if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
or you can get behind them you know if
it's<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.900> fracture<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.799> right

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it's on a fracture you can get right

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's on a fracture you can get right
underneath<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.509> know

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
underneath that kind of you know

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
underneath that kind of you know
building<00:01:28.049> area<00:01:28.290> where<00:01:28.439> delta<00:01:28.680> T<00:01:28.860> come<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.159> or

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
building area where delta T come out or

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.010 
building area where delta T come out or
an<00:01:29.670> exercise<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> was

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
an exercise you can see here I was

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
an exercise you can see here I was
halfway<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.590> alleyway<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.220> hadn't

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
halfway down the alleyway if I hadn't

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
halfway down the alleyway if I hadn't
hit<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.640> lamppost<00:01:32.850> um<00:01:33.650> but<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
obvious and run start the game this will

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
obvious and run start the game this will
give<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.560> good<00:01:37.680> advantage

give your really really good advantage
and<00:01:38.250> obviously<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> middle<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and obviously if you're in the middle of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
and obviously if you're in the middle of
a<00:01:39.869> game<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.530> could<00:01:40.619> obviously<00:01:40.799> allow<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
a game then it could obviously allow you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.469 
a game then it could obviously allow you
to<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.340> back<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> action<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.210> much

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to get back in the action that much

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
to get back in the action that much
quicker<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.320> even<00:01:43.439> use<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.890> escape

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
quicker or you can even use it to escape

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
quicker or you can even use it to escape
of<00:01:44.399> things<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.729> you're<00:01:44.880> being<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.720> shot

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of things if you're being you know shot

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.630 
of things if you're being you know shot
out<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> intellect<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.310> harder<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
out of intellect to be a lot harder to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.910 
out of intellect to be a lot harder to
kind<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.880> hit<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.750> bouncing<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.680> fast

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
kind of hit a bouncing really fast

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
kind of hit a bouncing really fast
moving<00:01:50.220> target<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> be

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
moving target so I'm just to be

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
moving target so I'm just to be
completely<00:01:52.350> clear<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.640> order<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
completely clear what you do in order to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
completely clear what you do in order to
do<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> use<00:01:55.470> Tim<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
do this is you have to use Tim and you

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.990 
do this is you have to use Tim and you
sprint<00:01:56.759> towards<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> wall

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
sprint towards a wall

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.090 
sprint towards a wall
wall<00:01:58.150> run<00:01:58.360> while<00:01:58.810> stimming<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.500> then<00:01:59.950> when

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
wall run while stimming and then when

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100 
wall run while stimming and then when
you<00:02:00.190> come<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.580> jump<00:02:00.760> off<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.120> wall<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.930> have

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
you come and jump off the wall you have

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.480 
you come and jump off the wall you have
to<00:02:02.230> make<00:02:02.380> sure<00:02:02.410> you<00:02:02.620> hit<00:02:02.770> jump<00:02:03.070> every<00:02:03.460> time

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
to make sure you hit jump every time

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.060 
to make sure you hit jump every time
every<00:02:04.120> single<00:02:04.780> time<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:04.990> hit<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.320> ground<00:02:05.440> so

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
every single time you hit the ground so

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.400 
every single time you hit the ground so
effectively<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:07.150> know<00:02:07.240> run<00:02:07.690> jump<00:02:08.170> and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
effectively is you know run jump and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.010 
effectively is you know run jump and
jump<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.340> jump<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.660> keep<00:02:10.780> going<00:02:10.840> like

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
jump and jump and you keep going like

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.840 
jump and jump and you keep going like
that<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:12.010> does<00:02:12.190> take<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> look<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> bit<00:02:12.700> getting

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
that it does take a look a bit getting

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.100 
that it does take a look a bit getting
used<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.570> see<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.840> couple<00:02:14.050> of
