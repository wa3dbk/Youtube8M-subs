are calling it we've had a tremendous
amount<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.389> snow<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.110> under<00:00:14.040> three<00:00:14.400> weeks

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
amount of snow in just under three weeks

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.990 
amount of snow in just under three weeks
and<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.360> means<00:00:15.630> ice<00:00:16.560> dams<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.250> lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> people

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and that means ice dams a lot of people

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.960 
and that means ice dams a lot of people
have<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.539> tremendous<00:00:19.410> amount<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.770> snow<00:00:20.130> built

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have a tremendous amount of snow built

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.990 
have a tremendous amount of snow built
up<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.449> their<00:00:21.869> roofs<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.580> when<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.789> into

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
up on their roofs and when you get into

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880 
up on their roofs and when you get into
a<00:00:24.029> freeze<00:00:24.390> thaw<00:00:24.660> cycle<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:25.650> huge

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a freeze thaw cycle you get these huge

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.179 
a freeze thaw cycle you get these huge
icicles<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.060> ice<00:00:27.869> dams<00:00:28.199> most<00:00:28.859> people

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
icicles and you get ice dams most people

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.700 
icicles and you get ice dams most people
want<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> blame<00:00:29.580> their<00:00:29.760> roofer<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.619> when<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
want to blame their roofer and when you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
want to blame their roofer and when you
have<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> leak<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.369> guess<00:00:32.669> that's<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.940> natural<00:00:33.420> but

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
have a leak I guess that's a natural but

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
have a leak I guess that's a natural but
you've<00:00:34.170> got<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> remember<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.730> roof<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you've got to remember that your roof is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
you've got to remember that your roof is
not<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> hull<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> ship<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.829> took

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
not like the hull of a ship if you took

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069 
not like the hull of a ship if you took
your<00:00:38.250> house<00:00:38.460> turned<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> upside<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
your house turned it upside down and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.690 
your house turned it upside down and
tried<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> float<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> water<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.520> would

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
tried to float it in the water it would

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
tried to float it in the water it would
not<00:00:41.910> float<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:43.020> watertight

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
not float because it's not watertight

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
not float because it's not watertight
and<00:00:44.309> when<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.730> water<00:00:44.940> backups<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.960> your

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and when you have water backups on your

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
and when you have water backups on your
roof<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:47.100> water<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.210> find<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> way

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
roof that water is going to find a way

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.080 
roof that water is going to find a way
and<00:00:48.960> even<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> newer<00:00:49.950> roof<00:00:50.309> well

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and even if you have a newer roof well

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
and even if you have a newer roof well
what's<00:00:51.300> causing<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.930> generally<00:00:52.680> what

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
what's causing this generally what

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.819 
what's causing this generally what
happens<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.610> he's<00:00:54.120> escaping<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.559> house

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
happens is he's escaping from your house

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
happens is he's escaping from your house
up<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> Attic<00:00:57.059> through<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> eaves<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
up into the Attic through the eaves and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
up into the Attic through the eaves and
so<00:00:58.050> forth<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:59.129> causing<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.149> area<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
so forth and it's causing that area to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
so forth and it's causing that area to
become<00:01:00.840> warmer<00:01:01.500> than<00:01:01.920> 32<00:01:02.489> degrees<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
become warmer than 32 degrees which is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
become warmer than 32 degrees which is
causing<00:01:03.539> melting<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.830> snow<00:01:05.159> melts<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
causing melting as that snow melts and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.000 
causing melting as that snow melts and
becomes<00:01:05.729> water<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.780> comes<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.350> toward<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
becomes water it comes down toward the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
becomes water it comes down toward the
soffits<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.850> house<00:01:09.060> where<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
soffits on your house where it's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
soffits on your house where it's
actually<00:01:10.110> colder<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.830> refreezes<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> that's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
actually colder and refreezes and that's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.270 
actually colder and refreezes and that's
when<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.810> giant<00:01:13.080> icicles<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.830> ice

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
when you get these giant icicles and ice

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.670 
when you get these giant icicles and ice
backups<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> gutters<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> beyond<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
backups in the gutters and beyond and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
backups in the gutters and beyond and
when<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> water<00:01:17.159> keeps<00:01:17.460> coming<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:17.850> from

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
when that water keeps coming down from

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
when that water keeps coming down from
the<00:01:18.390> higher<00:01:18.540> parts<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> roof<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.979> has

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the higher parts of the roof it has

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.039 
the higher parts of the roof it has
nowhere<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.270> finds<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.689> way<00:01:21.720> through

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
nowhere to go so it finds a way through

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
nowhere to go so it finds a way through
well<00:01:22.680> how<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.369> let's<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:23.970> take<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
well how do we know this let's go take a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.330 
well how do we know this let's go take a
look<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> garage<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.560> house<00:01:25.830> there's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
look at a garage this is a house there's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
look at a garage this is a house there's
heat<00:01:26.610> inside<00:01:26.970> there's<00:01:27.270> melting<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.810> on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
heat inside there's melting going on

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.050 
heat inside there's melting going on
take<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> garage<00:01:29.490> you'll<00:01:29.790> see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
take a look at a garage you'll see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
take a look at a garage you'll see
virtually<00:01:30.900> no<00:01:31.079> icicles<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.950> an

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
virtually no icicles because it's an

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.450 
virtually no icicles because it's an
unheated<00:01:32.369> area<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> here's<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.110> garage<00:01:37.890> you'll

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
unheated area so here's a garage you'll

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100 
unheated area so here's a garage you'll
notice<00:01:38.820> there's<00:01:39.030> no<00:01:39.180> icicles<00:01:39.750> because

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
notice there's no icicles because

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410 
notice there's no icicles because
there's<00:01:40.290> no<00:01:40.439> heat<00:01:40.680> source<00:01:40.950> inside<00:01:41.520> there's<00:01:42.270> no

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
there's no heat source inside there's no

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
there's no heat source inside there's no
heat<00:01:42.689> escaping<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.380> through<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> roof

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
heat escaping up through the roof

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
heat escaping up through the roof
there's<00:01:44.729> no<00:01:44.850> melting<00:01:45.390> there's<00:01:45.689> no<00:01:45.869> ice<00:01:46.049> dams

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there's no melting there's no ice dams

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
there's no melting there's no ice dams
so<00:01:47.149> what<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.640> short

for<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.300> visit<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.780> can<00:02:13.959> use<00:02:14.170> our<00:02:14.500> thermal

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
for a visit we can use our thermal

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
and see if that's adequate but sometimes

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.340 
and see if that's adequate but sometimes
even<00:02:30.580> with<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> newer<00:02:31.000> roof<00:02:31.299> with<00:02:31.870> soffit

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
even powered vents it's not enough to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.050 
even powered vents it's not enough to
exhaust<00:02:38.350> all<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.799> heat<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.250> keep<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.760> attic

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.110 
cool enough another possible solution
would<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.470> different<00:02:45.430> insulation

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
would be to have different insulation

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.449 
would be to have different insulation
put<00:02:46.360> into<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:46.810> attic<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:48.220> would<00:02:48.340> be

great advantages of that it makes your

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.400 
great advantages of that it makes your

roof last longer and it really should

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.110 
roof last longer and it really should
tighten<00:03:05.799> up<00:03:05.859> that<00:03:06.100> area<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.579> prevent<00:03:06.970> my

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
tighten up that area and prevent my

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
tighten up that area and prevent my
stamps<00:03:07.540> from<00:03:07.630> happening<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:08.260> there's<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.739> lot

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
