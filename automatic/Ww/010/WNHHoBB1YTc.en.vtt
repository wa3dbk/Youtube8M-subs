00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
size hole I need I'm sure they have to

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.960 
size hole I need I'm sure they have to
get<00:02:01.869> some<00:02:02.110> air<00:02:02.349> though<00:02:02.500> they<00:02:03.399> do<00:02:03.549> get<00:02:03.700> some

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
with a water flowing I'm just not sure

which as plants bill is pretty low so I
don't<00:02:13.569> really<00:02:13.750> want<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.349> lot<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> air

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
don't really want a lot of air

there<00:02:37.730> might<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.450> probably<00:02:38.599> better

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
there might be it's probably better

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.350 
there might be it's probably better
wasted<00:02:39.379> put<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> hole<00:02:40.159> in<00:02:40.280> there<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.819> want<00:02:41.239> to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
wasted put a hole in there but I want to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.930 
wasted put a hole in there but I want to
deal<00:02:41.540> without<00:02:41.690> having<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.739> fight<00:02:43.010> any<00:02:43.310> tools

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
deal without having to fight any tools

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.780 
deal without having to fight any tools
not<00:02:44.659> even<00:02:44.930> screwdriver

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.600 

now<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.330> top<00:02:51.659> I<00:02:51.930> pre-cut<00:02:52.439> almost<00:02:53.069> all<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> way

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
now the top I pre-cut almost all the way

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.640 
now the top I pre-cut almost all the way
because<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.629> hard<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> hold<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> camera<00:02:55.470> in

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
I've had these stacked

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.830 
I've had these stacked
eight<00:03:49.310> high<00:03:49.610> but<00:03:50.090> I'm<00:03:50.180> not<00:03:50.330> going<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.510> do<00:03:50.660> that

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
eight high but I'm not going to do that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.380 
eight high but I'm not going to do that
here<00:03:52.060> because<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.270> don't<00:03:53.360> have<00:03:53.450> room

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.270 

no<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.200> one<00:03:59.350> doesn't<00:03:59.380> have<00:03:59.680> water<00:03:59.980> into<00:04:00.220> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
no that one doesn't have water into the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.470 
no that one doesn't have water into the
bucket<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.610> holes<00:04:00.819> with<00:04:01.030> bottom<00:04:01.300> doesn't

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
bucket the holes with bottom doesn't

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.570 
bucket the holes with bottom doesn't
have<00:04:01.660> holes<00:04:01.840> in<00:04:01.990> it

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
have holes in it

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.070 
have holes in it
and<00:04:03.580> as<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.300> can<00:04:04.390> see<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.920> water<00:04:06.160> itself<00:04:07.080> the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
and as you can see the water itself the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.720 
and as you can see the water itself the
advantage<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.800> this<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.340> don't<00:04:09.490> have<00:04:09.550> to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
advantage to this is you don't have to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.510 
advantage to this is you don't have to
water<00:04:09.940> every<00:04:10.209> ceiling<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:11.040> every<00:04:12.040> day<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
water every ceiling up every day you

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.940 
water every ceiling up every day you
know<00:04:12.730> instead<00:04:13.030> of<00:04:13.090> doing<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.360> eight<00:04:13.600> times

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
know instead of doing this eight times

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.620 
know instead of doing this eight times
this<00:04:14.950> part<00:04:15.340> on<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.520> top<00:04:15.580> that<00:04:16.239> trickles

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
this part on the top that trickles

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.580 
this part on the top that trickles
through<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.049> area<00:04:17.290> itself<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.720> roots<00:04:20.019> drink

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
through that area itself the roots drink

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.980 
through that area itself the roots drink
what<00:04:20.709> they<00:04:20.739> want<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:22.270> have<00:04:22.480> to<00:04:22.600> do<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.840> at

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
what they want you have to do this at

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.320 
what they want you have to do this at
least<00:04:23.169> two<00:04:23.320> times<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.680> day<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:24.160> do<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.090> three<00:04:25.300> or

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
least two times a day I do it three or

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
least two times a day I do it three or
four<00:04:25.419> if<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:25.810> could

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
four if I could

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.220 
four if I could
especially<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> environment<00:04:28.480> with<00:04:29.080> low

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
especially in a environment with low

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.080 
especially in a environment with low
humidity<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.770> all<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.370> got<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.580> do<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.790> pork

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
humidity so all you got to do the pork

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.720 
humidity so all you got to do the pork
there<00:04:34.270> again<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.660> change<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.110> lids<00:04:35.550> from<00:04:36.550> the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
there again is change the lids from the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.690 
there again is change the lids from the
empty<00:04:37.060> one<00:04:37.240> with<00:04:37.390> no<00:04:37.570> holes<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:39.100> full<00:04:39.400> one<00:04:39.610> with

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
empty one with no holes to full one with

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.330 
empty one with no holes to full one with
no<00:04:39.850> hood

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.280 

and<00:04:46.820> that's<00:04:47.000> all<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.420> got<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.660> do<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.870> water<00:04:48.080> it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
and that's all you got to do to water it

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.020 
and that's all you got to do to water it
stack<00:04:49.220> it<00:04:49.340> eight<00:04:49.490> hike<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.300> whatever<00:04:52.030> even

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
stack it eight hike it whatever even

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.670 
stack it eight hike it whatever even
with<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.450> fodder<00:04:53.690> seeds<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.320> everything<00:04:54.590> and

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
with the fodder seeds and everything and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.020 
with the fodder seeds and everything and
it's<00:04:54.830> still<00:04:55.040> not<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.310> heavy

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.490 

so<00:04:59.030> there's<00:04:59.210> your<00:04:59.360> watering<00:04:59.690> you<00:05:00.050> need<00:05:00.380> to

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.900 
throw away the water once a day the
water<00:05:02.750> gets<00:05:02.960> real<00:05:03.140> nasty<00:05:03.440> after<00:05:03.920> three<00:05:04.820> or

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
water gets real nasty after three or

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.810 
water gets real nasty after three or
four<00:05:05.120> times<00:05:05.740> up<00:05:06.740> going<00:05:07.100> through<00:05:07.310> there

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:17.260

now here's the little bit of a more

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.390 
now here's the little bit of a more
automated<00:05:20.360> system<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:21.110> here<00:05:21.319> this<00:05:22.130> has<00:05:22.370> a

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
automated system I have here this has a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.059 
automated system I have here this has a
pump<00:05:22.759> in<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:24.139> bottom<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:25.910> koi<00:05:26.780> pond<00:05:27.080> pump<00:05:27.380> it

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
about much money even for an automated

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.409 
about much money even for an automated
system<00:05:51.340> there's<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.400> little<00:05:52.669> design<00:05:53.030> flaw<00:05:53.389> I

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
system there's a little design flaw I

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.249 
system there's a little design flaw I
have<00:05:53.690> here<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.770> center<00:05:55.720> tubs<00:05:56.720> don't<00:05:57.080> get

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
have here the center tubs don't get

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.219 
have here the center tubs don't get
quite<00:05:57.949> as<00:05:57.979> much<00:05:58.280> water<00:05:58.580> as<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:59.569> outside<00:05:59.960> ones

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
quite as much water as the outside ones

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.170 
quite as much water as the outside ones
do<00:06:00.409> I<00:06:00.470> think<00:06:00.590> that's<00:06:00.860> because<00:06:01.069> of<00:06:01.430> you<00:06:01.970> have<00:06:02.150> a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
do I think that's because of you have a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.839 
do I think that's because of you have a
venturi<00:06:02.630> effect<00:06:02.780> across<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.590> top<00:06:03.860> of<00:06:04.669> the

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
venturi effect across the top of the

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.760 
venturi effect across the top of the
second<00:06:05.240> tee<00:06:05.419> it<00:06:05.900> actually<00:06:06.229> tries<00:06:06.470> to<00:06:06.590> suck

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
second tee it actually tries to suck

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.180 
second tee it actually tries to suck
water<00:06:06.830> but<00:06:07.280> I'm<00:06:07.699> gonna<00:06:07.880> cure<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.360> with<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:09.190> PVC

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
water but I'm gonna cure that with a PVC

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.460 
water but I'm gonna cure that with a PVC
manifold<00:06:11.030> probably<00:06:11.539> next<00:06:11.690> week<00:06:11.810> but<00:06:12.349> it

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
manifold probably next week but it

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.920 
manifold probably next week but it
doesn't<00:06:12.740> matter<00:06:12.889> they<00:06:13.069> grow<00:06:13.250> anyway<00:06:13.870> so<00:06:14.870> the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
doesn't matter they grow anyway so the

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.749 
doesn't matter they grow anyway so the
roots<00:06:15.139> don't<00:06:15.440> clog<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.979> bottom<00:06:16.310> of<00:06:16.580> the

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.660 

and<00:07:17.640> this<00:07:17.910> is<00:07:18.030> the<00:07:18.150> bag<00:07:18.360> I<00:07:18.510> got<00:07:18.950> that's<00:07:19.950> sweet

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
and this is the bag I got that's sweet

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.380 
and this is the bag I got that's sweet
it<00:07:21.030> was<00:07:21.920> dink<00:07:22.920> it<00:07:23.070> was<00:07:23.160> 13<00:07:23.580> bucks<00:07:23.850> for<00:07:24.090> 50

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
it was dink it was 13 bucks for 50

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.870 
it was dink it was 13 bucks for 50
pounds<00:07:24.540> of<00:07:24.840> it<00:07:24.960> I<00:07:25.550> calculated<00:07:26.550> that<00:07:26.700> it<00:07:26.820> would

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 
pounds of it I calculated that it would

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.990 
pounds of it I calculated that it would
take<00:07:26.940> that<00:07:27.360> would<00:07:27.570> be<00:07:27.690> enough<00:07:27.990> for<00:07:28.200> 50<00:07:28.770> days

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 
take that would be enough for 50 days

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.940 
take that would be enough for 50 days
for<00:07:30.000> the<00:07:30.120> animals<00:07:30.480> that<00:07:30.510> I<00:07:30.660> got<00:07:30.870> now<00:07:31.590> this<00:07:31.770> is

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:31.950 
for the animals that I got now this is

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.060 
for the animals that I got now this is
used<00:07:32.310> as<00:07:32.520> a<00:07:32.580> supplement
