00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
the time manipulation device now not to

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.219 
the time manipulation device now not to
give<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.850> too<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> storyline

Victor which is kind of confusing

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.719 
Victor which is kind of confusing
because<00:01:42.450> Victor<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.079> back<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> 1950s<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
because Victor was back in the 1950s so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.819 
because Victor was back in the 1950s so
yes<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> time<00:01:45.840> travel<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.560> forth

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
yes there is time travel back and forth

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
yes there is time travel back and forth
between<00:01:47.189> present<00:01:47.759> day<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.479> 1950s

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
between present day and the 1950s

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.039 
between present day and the 1950s
actually<00:01:50.100> generally<00:01:50.520> speaking<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.570> island

actually generally speaking the island

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
actually generally speaking the island
were<00:01:52.170> naturally<00:01:52.829> shift<00:01:53.250> back<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.640> forth

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
were naturally shift back and forth

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.080 
were naturally shift back and forth
between<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.659> 1950s<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.680> present<00:01:56.159> day<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

thing
gaming<00:02:14.209> since<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.140> antigravity<00:02:15.769> gun<00:02:16.340> in

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
gaming since the antigravity gun in

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.589 
gaming since the antigravity gun in
half-life<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.159> do<00:02:19.280> various<00:02:19.639> things<00:02:19.730> just

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
half-life it can do various things just

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.259 
half-life it can do various things just
name<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> few<00:02:21.079> here<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.499> can<00:02:21.709> age<00:02:21.920> items<00:02:22.400> that

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
name a few here it can age items that

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.660 
name a few here it can age items that
have<00:02:23.420> been<00:02:23.450> subjected<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> e<00:02:24.319> 99<00:02:24.859> so<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.489> can

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
have been subjected to the e 99 so I can

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.940 
have been subjected to the e 99 so I can
age<00:02:25.790> both<00:02:26.060> forwards<00:02:26.749> and<00:02:26.870> backwards<00:02:27.379> which<00:02:27.799> is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
age both forwards and backwards which is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.949 
age both forwards and backwards which is
really<00:02:28.159> cool<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.939> can<00:02:29.389> do<00:02:29.510> something<00:02:29.810> called

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
really cool it can do something called

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.470 
really cool it can do something called
deadlock<00:02:30.409> which<00:02:30.950> causes<00:02:31.639> an<00:02:31.760> area<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.359> be

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
deadlock which causes an area to be

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.009 
deadlock which causes an area to be
timeless<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.049> it's<00:02:33.200> like<00:02:33.349> you're<00:02:33.680> inducing<00:02:34.430> a

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
timeless so it's like you're inducing a

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.470 
timeless so it's like you're inducing a
singularity<00:02:36.019> in<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.409> certain<00:02:36.620> area<00:02:36.859> so<00:02:37.730> some

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
singularity in a certain area so some

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.839 
singularity in a certain area so some
enemies<00:02:38.810> are<00:02:38.930> coming<00:02:39.200> along<00:02:39.439> and<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.310> do

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
enemies are coming along and you can do

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.610 
enemies are coming along and you can do
the<00:02:41.030> deadlock<00:02:41.389> on<00:02:41.540> them<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.260> take<00:02:42.500> them

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
the deadlock on them and just take them

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.190 
the deadlock on them and just take them
out<00:02:42.769> because<00:02:42.950> if<00:02:43.189> frozen<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.609> time<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.200> you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
out because if frozen in time and you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.619 
out because if frozen in time and you
can<00:02:45.349> also<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:45.680> impulse<00:02:46.219> which<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.419> a

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
can also do impulse which is just a

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.309 
can also do impulse which is just a
energy<00:02:48.200> push<00:02:48.469> to<00:02:48.950> kill<00:02:49.340> off<00:02:49.519> or<00:02:49.930> push<00:02:50.930> enemies

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
energy push to kill off or push enemies

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.500 
energy push to kill off or push enemies
away<00:02:51.439> and<00:02:51.889> there<00:02:52.609> are<00:02:52.699> some<00:02:52.849> other<00:02:53.120> cool

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
don't have an auto a mun fortunately but

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.449 
don't have an auto a mun fortunately but
since<00:03:34.939> the<00:03:35.150> manual<00:03:35.930> aim<00:03:36.229> is<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.680> dead-on<00:03:36.949> it's

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
since the manual aim is so dead-on it's

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.990 
since the manual aim is so dead-on it's
actually<00:03:38.120> kind<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.870> neat<00:03:39.109> that<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.560> can

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
actually kind of neat that you can

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.610 
actually kind of neat that you can
smoothly<00:03:41.000> shoot<00:03:41.720> someone<00:03:42.019> without<00:03:42.199> the<00:03:42.470> auto

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
smoothly shoot someone without the auto

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.580

aim<00:03:43.060> also<00:03:44.060> there's<00:03:44.239> no<00:03:44.359> cover<00:03:44.629> system<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.439> it's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
aim also there's no cover system so it's

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.349 
aim also there's no cover system so it's
kind<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.799> like<00:03:45.889> Call<00:03:46.129> of<00:03:46.159> Duty<00:03:46.519> just<00:03:47.060> crouch

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
kind of like Call of Duty just crouch

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.289 
kind of like Call of Duty just crouch
behind<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:48.109> boxes<00:03:48.530> or<00:03:48.799> maybe<00:03:49.729> you<00:03:50.120> could

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
behind the boxes or maybe you could

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.509 
behind the boxes or maybe you could
crouch<00:03:50.569> behind<00:03:50.599> some<00:03:51.379> shattered<00:03:51.799> boxes<00:03:52.310> which

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
crouch behind some shattered boxes which
