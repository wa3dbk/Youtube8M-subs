it yeah so actually I can see why do you
remove<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.280> cuz<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> like

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
remove this cuz it was it's kind of like

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.710 
remove this cuz it was it's kind of like
I<00:01:42.930> guess<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.430> pointless<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I guess not not pointless but it's a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
I guess not not pointless but it's a
really<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.530> short<00:01:46.799> mission<00:01:47.310> man<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
really really short mission man you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
really really short mission man you
think<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> there's<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.780> much

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
think about it like and there's not much

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
think about it like and there's not much
of<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.200> challenge<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.950> other<00:01:50.130> than<00:01:50.340> just

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
of a challenge to it other than just

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.670 
of a challenge to it other than just
like<00:01:50.820> pulling<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> car<00:01:52.140> from<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.350> trail

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
like pulling the car from the trail

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.440 
like pulling the car from the trail
train<00:01:53.130> tracks<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> real

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
train tracks it's not like a real

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.929 
train tracks it's not like a real
mission<00:01:54.930> although<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> does<00:01:56.159> introduce<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
mission although it does introduce the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.170 
mission although it does introduce the
tow<00:01:57.210> truck<00:01:57.659> though<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.710> guess<00:01:59.340> maybe<00:01:59.670> Davos

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
tow truck though so I guess maybe Davos

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.719 
tow truck though so I guess maybe Davos
it's<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.719> kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.049> purpose<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.560> yeah<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it's all kind of purpose but yeah as I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's all kind of purpose but yeah as I
say<00:02:03.030> um<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.710> could<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:04.979> been<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
say um you know it could have been that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
say um you know it could have been that
you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> space

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you know just because the space

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
you know just because the space
constraints<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:07.770> were<00:02:07.860> looking<00:02:08.129> at<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
constraints they were looking at the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
constraints they were looking at the
most<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.750> new<00:02:09.989> things<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
most you know my new things and the you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.970 
most you know my new things and the you
thought<00:02:11.190> about<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.610> mission

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
thought about this mission

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.589 
thought about this mission
isn't<00:02:12.430> really<00:02:12.610> done<00:02:12.730> port<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.450> just

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
isn't really done port and so we just

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.930 
isn't really done port and so we just
take<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.959> out<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.769> I'm<00:02:15.040> yeah<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.580> mission

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
take it out so I'm yeah this mission

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.399 
take it out so I'm yeah this mission
would<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.150> made<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:18.489> car<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.360> said<00:02:19.930> place

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
would have made the the car I said place

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.589 
would have made the the car I said place
have<00:02:21.010> five<00:02:21.400> missions<00:02:22.000> which<00:02:22.209> would<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.510> been

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
have five missions which would have been

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.750 
have five missions which would have been
really<00:02:22.930> long<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.379> that's<00:02:24.099> interesting<00:02:24.370> buzzer

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
really long so that's interesting buzzer

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.390 
really long so that's interesting buzzer
say<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.180> pretty<00:02:25.420> short<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.500> guess<00:02:27.220> that's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
say it's pretty short so I guess that's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.830 
say it's pretty short so I guess that's
probably<00:02:27.519> why<00:02:27.760> they<00:02:27.879> took<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.090> out<00:02:28.299> ultimately

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
probably why they took it out ultimately

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.650 
probably why they took it out ultimately
so<00:02:29.230> yeah<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:30.220> that's<00:02:30.549> yeah<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.849> there<00:02:34.540> we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
so yeah that's that's yeah so there we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:45.600 
so yeah that's that's yeah so there we
go

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.179 

and<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:47.000> get<00:02:47.230> $5,000<00:02:48.230> for<00:02:48.379> doing<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.739> mission

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
and we get $5,000 for doing that mission

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.670 
and we get $5,000 for doing that mission
so<00:02:49.549> once<00:02:50.209> again<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.689> with<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.959> zero<00:02:51.230> chain

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
so once again like with the zero chain

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.059 
so once again like with the zero chain
um<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.959> amount<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.379> money<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:54.950> would

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
um the amount of money that you would

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.770 
um the amount of money that you would
have<00:02:55.129> gotten<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.819> this<00:02:56.060> chain<00:02:56.420> would<00:02:56.629> have

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
have gotten from this chain would have

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.690 
have gotten from this chain would have
been<00:02:56.900> obviously<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.349> lot<00:02:57.590> more<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.370> it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
been obviously a lot more so it's

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.080 
been obviously a lot more so it's
interesting<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.239> know<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.959> yeah<00:03:00.859> and<00:03:01.220> that's

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
interesting to know so yeah and that's

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.020 
interesting to know so yeah and that's
the<00:03:02.450> penultimate<00:03:02.900> mission<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.579> next<00:03:04.790> part

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
the penultimate mission so the next part

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.149 
the penultimate mission so the next part
we're<00:03:05.150> gonna<00:03:05.239> do<00:03:05.480> we're<00:03:05.930> gonna<00:03:06.049> rather<00:03:06.769> have

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
we're gonna do we're gonna rather have

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.550 
we're gonna do we're gonna rather have
part<00:03:07.670> seven<00:03:08.239> where<00:03:08.840> we're<00:03:08.989> going<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.409> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
part seven where we're going to do the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.209 
part seven where we're going to do the
mission<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.639> truth<00:03:10.879> is<00:03:11.120> out<00:03:11.269> there<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:12.409> that's

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
mission the truth is out there so that's

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.059 
mission the truth is out there so that's
gonna<00:03:13.879> be<00:03:13.969> a<00:03:14.120> typical<00:03:14.540> one<00:03:14.870> because<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.590> pretty
