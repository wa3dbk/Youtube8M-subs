00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 and greet everyone his trackers a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 link this ghost writer so I make a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.120
 new video on imagined aircraft 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.190
 so now endlessly it's going a bit 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.340
 change server I'm not like 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.250
 you can see it with the cat 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.500
 on the y seguin so more 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 especially eagles games i 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 am on the imaginary faction server 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 kraft and so if I make this video 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 it's first of all to explain the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.539
 long duration of my lack of videos 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.340
 so first of all I have for those who 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 play on the imaginary kraft will be 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.090
 I stopped the videos when I 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 have been moderator on the server 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.399
 so here we have been six months that I 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.329
 am moderator so I feel created the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.360
 January 16th 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.489
 So here we are, we have finally managed 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 gerard install all the stuff of my 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.550
 pc so I had more fraps and then 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.850
 I was a little lazy of the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.340
 reinstall all but the jelly so 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.949
 reinstall and so does this video 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.019
 so that's to tell you I'm planning to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 to make an event on the factions but a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.790
 true want to prepare that I will handle 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 all alone so there are some who 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.900
 are going to say yeah but have safir a bar 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 craven that one warns even to smother 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.830
 the pc like you thing foo 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 except that not so me already I am put 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 okay for six months that's six 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.280
 month that I want to do a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 event like this and here I launch 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 for real because I had already done 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.890
 videos of ads I was not 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 satisfied with me so that's going to be a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:35.159
 real thing so I think it will take place 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.979
 in several times I have some reason the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.900
 name the number of participants so that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.890
 will be the first to send me who are 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.070
 enrolled who will participate therefore 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.930
 I explain her pride levelt and others 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.270
 calls have planned to make a peace event 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.220
 finally so called pvp but me if I 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.490
 do not call it ppp where we can come 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.020
 with the staff that we want and with the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.520
 potions as their wishes with a shadow 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.140
 potato chips that we want the most 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 steve that we want with the sword we 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.360
 so wants the thing that is for me well 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.130
 obviously completely loyal it's very 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.960
 ironic 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 because I think it's not pvp 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.470
 from the moment the staff is not 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.390
 fair finds it completely nil 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.110
 so here I was signed up at the beginning to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.420
 this event 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 after I drank a little more rules and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.960
 I found it nil so I got 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.520
 register the scales in pouring aid 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.090
 why I had to unsubscribe I had 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.590
 make a video 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.750
 so it will have to come in nine men at 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.650
 psychic finally minimum to participate there 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.690
 must have a staff at psy protection 1 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.460
 with a face in a rugby year and the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.290
 eat any kind of food 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.240
 apart from the food that gives beef 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.710
 example like the coke the red bull the 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.360
 apples shit apples from retz all that 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.890
 or blow come with steaks of 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.440
 potato carrots and all that is 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.480
 authorized and therefore I repeat in protection 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.330
 it is necessary at least to have rostov in 9,6 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.520
 protection 1 and a sharp sword a 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.870
 an rugby so you will be able to participate in 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.550
 level it will be done in several hens 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.250
 and the winner will win a divine kit so 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.480
 protection marsters protection 4 in 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.930
 option with a t4 to 2 9 and 5 apples 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.060
 chips 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.790
