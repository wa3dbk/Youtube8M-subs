00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
this little switch here and it moves

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.000 
this little switch here and it moves
across<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:49.660> you<00:00:49.930> can<00:00:50.020> see<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.320> little<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.739> top

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
wit there is a bit laggy and that

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.540 
wit there is a bit laggy and that
doesn't<00:00:56.620> really<00:00:56.739> matter<00:00:56.950> I<00:00:57.219> mean<00:00:57.430> that's

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
doesn't really matter I mean that's

clouds<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.770> so<00:00:59.920> just<00:01:00.160> cycles<00:01:00.820> through<00:01:01.110> this<00:01:02.110> a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
clouds and so just cycles through this a

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
which is a bit weird because they're

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.050 
which is a bit weird because they're
four<00:01:24.610> blocks<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:26.130> greystone<00:01:27.130> doesn't<00:01:27.970> get

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
four blocks and greystone doesn't get

four blocks and greystone doesn't get
knocked<00:01:28.240> off<00:01:29.100> anyway<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.760> i'll<00:01:30.820> show<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.060> how

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
knocked off anyway so i'll show you how

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.340 
knocked off anyway so i'll show you how
that<00:01:31.510> works<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.020> back<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:34.259> we'll<00:01:35.259> just

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
that works in the back and we'll just

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
that works in the back and we'll just
put<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:35.799> off

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.100 

so<00:01:41.140> just<00:01:41.350> couldn't<00:01:41.950> come<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.610> would

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so just couldn't come this in would

base operations this here is the basic

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.510 
base operations this here is the basic
part<00:02:03.040> missing<00:02:03.420> which<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.690> it's<00:02:05.620> you<00:02:06.190> know<00:02:06.280> just

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
doors back off that's pretty much just a

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.070 
doors back off that's pretty much just a
whole<00:03:06.370> heap<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.640> pistons<00:03:07.180> on<00:03:07.690> top<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.989> each

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
whole heap of pistons on top of each

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.210 
whole heap of pistons on top of each
other<00:03:08.260> fishing<00:03:09.070> on<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:10.290> getting<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.920> red

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
other fishing on and getting the red

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.430 
other fishing on and getting the red
stone<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.790> piston<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.540> breaking<00:03:14.320> you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
stone to the piston that breaking you

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.410 
stone to the piston that breaking you
think<00:03:14.680> was<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.890> bit<00:03:15.010> hard<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:16.060> getting<00:03:16.330> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
think was a bit hard and getting the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.949 
think was a bit hard and getting the
time<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.840> right<00:03:17.790> as<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.060> see<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.360> top

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
time and right as you can see that top

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.310 
time and right as you can see that top
one<00:03:20.459> when<00:03:21.459> i<00:03:21.489> eat<00:03:22.000> play<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.450> through<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.989> it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
one when i eat play it through is it

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.350 
one when i eat play it through is it
delayed<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:26.760> that's<00:03:27.760> pretty<00:03:27.940> much<00:03:28.030> all<00:03:28.239> there

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
delayed and that's pretty much all there

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.530 
delayed and that's pretty much all there
is<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.750> or<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:30.550> know<00:03:30.790> being<00:03:31.330> red

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
is to it or just just know being red

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.590 
is to it or just just know being red
stone<00:03:31.780> into<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.110> right<00:03:32.260> steps<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:34.450> then

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
stone into the right steps and then

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.930 
stone into the right steps and then
swinging<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.739> off<00:03:37.320> okay<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:39.400> that's<00:03:39.700> there

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.190 

this<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.060> one<00:03:44.209> other<00:03:44.420> little<00:03:44.630> thing<00:03:44.780> going<00:03:45.080> to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
this is one other little thing going to

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.240 
this is one other little thing going to
show<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:46.420> click<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.540> video<00:03:47.690> here<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:52.130> this

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
show you click the video here so this

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.020 
show you click the video here so this
everything<00:03:52.880> here<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.780> um<00:03:54.100> some<00:03:55.100> little<00:03:55.400> there

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
everything here is um some little there

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.780 
everything here is um some little there
was<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.240> house<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:57.050> when<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.200> added<00:03:57.620> some<00:03:57.790> piston

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
was a house and when I added some piston

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.320 
was a house and when I added some piston
mechanisms<00:03:59.720> inside<00:04:00.730> she<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:01.940> make<00:04:02.180> an

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
mechanisms inside she so make an

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.800 
mechanisms inside she so make an
elevator<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.560> bit<00:04:03.680> weird<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> it's

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
elevator and it's a bit weird so it's

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:15.420 
elevator and it's a bit weird so it's
all<00:04:05.959> in<00:04:06.350> there<00:04:08.620> I'll<00:04:09.620> go<00:04:09.680> around<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.280> it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.159 

there's<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.489> entrance<00:04:16.900> when<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:17.989> have<00:04:18.079> to

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
there's the entrance when you have to

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.380 
there's the entrance when you have to
start<00:04:18.200> an<00:04:18.500> exact<00:04:18.950> center<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:20.030> make<00:04:20.180> this<00:04:20.329> work

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
start an exact center to make this work

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.550 
start an exact center to make this work
otherwise<00:04:21.230> doesn't<00:04:22.070> push<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.460> all<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.730> way

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
otherwise doesn't push you all the way

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.200 
otherwise doesn't push you all the way
well<00:04:24.560> not<00:04:24.710> not<00:04:24.890> the<00:04:24.950> exact<00:04:25.370> center<00:04:25.669> movie<00:04:25.940> in

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
well not not the exact center movie in

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.430 
well not not the exact center movie in
these<00:04:26.510> four<00:04:26.720> pixels<00:04:27.190> um<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.230> push

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
these four pixels um so you just push

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.490 
these four pixels um so you just push
lund<00:04:30.680> oh<00:04:32.020> yeah<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:34.880> not<00:04:35.120> just<00:04:35.419> one<00:04:36.229> after

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
lund oh yeah so it's not just one after

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.620 
lund oh yeah so it's not just one after
another<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:37.550> pushes<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.060> up<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.390> then<00:04:38.419> that

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
another this pushes you up and then that

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.170 
another this pushes you up and then that
pushes<00:04:38.900> across<00:04:39.050> onto<00:04:39.500> this<00:04:39.590> one<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.100> pushes<00:04:41.030> out

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
pushes across onto this one I pushes out

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.030 
pushes across onto this one I pushes out
