00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.729
 again 

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:06.440
 more and more diminished middle class that comes to quito a pablo marrero 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.360
 Miguel Ferrer against the arsenal 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.990
 more imagination is going to take out the finances of this country from tremendous bump 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.839
 the pancha paz public policies of those who have governed us 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.939
 both blue and tricolors the one you want and I purposely come to the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.819
 head since I put them make 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.849
 that comes from a specialist 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.939
 already in the heart 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.979
 You may think it's 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.380
 of the opposition 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.380
 because he has ill will to the president 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.150
 nor politics has a single goal 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.040
 create well-paid jobs so you and your family can live better 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.840
 and for that I'm going to be four things 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.060
 I am going to reduce taxes for those who work produce by generating jobs and 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.160
 I will simplify your payment 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.600
 second 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.080
 I go to the spar in tarrasa totally 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.800
 the taxes we pay 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.440
 I'm going to invest your money better 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.700
 and fourth I will guarantee economic stability to take care of your heritage 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 so first 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.910
 I'm going to lower the income tax rate 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.720
 because the Mexicans that produce that invest that work that generate others 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.900
 jobs should not pay more taxes than those paid elsewhere in the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.430
 world 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 that will allow us to have more investment and more employment that is what I am looking for and for 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.470
 then it will be easier than ever 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.050
 make a statement you can do it simply and without the help of anyone 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.440
 second I'm going to handle in a glass box the money of the people here not having 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.870
 hidden fidecomisos or mysterious boxes you to you to know where you are going to whom 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.700
 spend it how you spend up to the last dime you pay taxes 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.050
 third I will invest better what we have 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.110
 I'm going to invest money what truly klÃ³ker me of the mind 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.070
 you need I will invest in schools 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.480
 and in quality universities for your children 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.070
 I'm going to invest in health 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.479
 not only to continue with the popular insurance if I do not go for health insurance 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.170
 for all because my goal is that no Mexican this without doctors and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.209
 medicines and without treatment and I'll start with all the children that are born 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.649
 when I am president of the republic 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:20.569
 quarter 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 I will also use the money precisely in the communities 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.229
 indigenous people on the roads that are needed in drinking water 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.859
 I'm going to invest the money in the security we need to get back out to 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.469
 the streets with tranquility 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.149
 and fourth point said I'm going to adapt antisana economic stability for 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.839
 what 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:40.899
 to take care of your heritage 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.509
 I will launch the economic stability park will go down the interest rates 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.409
 and you can buy a house 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.019
 so you can renovate your kitchen so you can truly have a car 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.110
 I'm going to lower interest rates so there's more investment in Mexico and 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.439
 there is more employment in synthesis my fiscal policy will be 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.299
 passes taxes for those who produce so that there is more investment more 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.679
 employment and so that we can live better 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:07.659
 it 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.379
 I'm serious
