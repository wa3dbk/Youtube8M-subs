this<00:00:05.040> video<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.460> me<00:00:05.910> drawing<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.770> Dilophosaurus

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
this video is me drawing a Dilophosaurus

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.980 
this video is me drawing a Dilophosaurus
as<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.490> can<00:00:08.580> see<00:00:08.790> I'm<00:00:08.940> already<00:00:09.300> getting<00:00:09.690> into

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
as you can see I'm already getting into

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.140 
as you can see I'm already getting into
the<00:00:10.250> compositional<00:00:11.250> sketch<00:00:11.610> getting<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the compositional sketch getting the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.660 
the compositional sketch getting the
head<00:00:12.330> together<00:00:12.690> putting<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> frills<00:00:14.219> this

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
head together putting in the frills this

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330 
head together putting in the frills this
ah<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.719> drawing<00:00:16.170> actually<00:00:16.680> doesn't<00:00:17.010> involve

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
ah this drawing actually doesn't involve

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
ah this drawing actually doesn't involve
much<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> body<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.090> wanted<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:19.020> draw

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
much of the body I just wanted to draw

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.080 
much of the body I just wanted to draw
the<00:00:19.289> frills<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> head<00:00:20.250> itself<00:00:20.580> spitting

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the frills and the head itself spitting

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.550 
the frills and the head itself spitting
because<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.420> saw<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.689> really<00:00:21.900> cool<00:00:22.199> picture

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
because I saw this really cool picture

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.769 
because I saw this really cool picture
of<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.680> dragon<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:24.180> reminded<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
of a dragon that really reminded me of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
of a dragon that really reminded me of
the<00:00:24.869> Dilophosaurus<00:00:25.619> spitting<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.730> Jurassic

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the Dilophosaurus spitting from Jurassic

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.419 
the Dilophosaurus spitting from Jurassic
Park<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.539> thought<00:00:27.750> I'd<00:00:27.960> do<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.560> own<00:00:28.890> version

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
Park so I thought I'd do my own version

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.049 
Park so I thought I'd do my own version
of<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:30.810> I've<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.309> sketch<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of it so now I've got the the sketch of

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.270 
of it so now I've got the the sketch of
the<00:00:33.510> main<00:00:33.960> bits<00:00:34.320> together<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> decide<00:00:35.130> I'm

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the main bits together I decide I'm

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670 
the main bits together I decide I'm
gonna<00:00:35.460> refine<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> details<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:36.930> putting

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
gonna refine all the details now putting

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
gonna refine all the details now putting
my<00:00:37.920> harder<00:00:38.430> lines<00:00:38.700> putting<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
my harder lines putting in some of the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
my harder lines putting in some of the
detail<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.340> crest<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> uh<00:00:42.930> yeah<00:00:43.850> then<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
detail and that crest so uh yeah then I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.590 
detail and that crest so uh yeah then I
put<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> mouse<00:00:45.739> doing<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.160> lower<00:00:47.760> jaw<00:00:48.180> as

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
put in the mouse doing the lower jaw as

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.939 
put in the mouse doing the lower jaw as
you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> tunnel<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.949> there's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you can see and the tunnel and there's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.670 
you can see and the tunnel and there's
little<00:00:53.309> tiny<00:00:53.760> needle-like<00:00:54.629> teeth<00:00:55.110> because

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
little tiny needle-like teeth because

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.920 
little tiny needle-like teeth because
the<00:00:56.149> Dilophosaurus<00:00:57.149> teeth<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> quite

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the Dilophosaurus teeth is quite

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.810 
the Dilophosaurus teeth is quite
different<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> los<00:00:58.770> Rip<00:00:59.010> Torn<00:00:59.160> tyrant

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
different to the los Rip Torn tyrant

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.049 
different to the los Rip Torn tyrant
Saurus<00:01:00.090> Rex<00:01:00.359> teeth<00:01:00.629> they're<00:01:01.020> very<00:01:01.260> tiny<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
Saurus Rex teeth they're very tiny the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.420 
Saurus Rex teeth they're very tiny the
next<00:01:03.329> part<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> video<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.530> me<00:01:05.040> drawing

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
next part of this video is me drawing

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.859 
next part of this video is me drawing
those<00:01:05.729> frills<00:01:06.920> frills<00:01:08.420> yeah<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.630> guess<00:01:09.780> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
those frills frills yeah I guess you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
those frills frills yeah I guess you
call<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.049> frill<00:01:10.320> yeah<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> real<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.970> all

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
call it frill yeah it is it real so all

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.609 
call it frill yeah it is it real so all
those<00:01:12.930> spikes<00:01:14.540> takes<00:01:15.540> quite<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> long<00:01:16.320> time

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
those spikes takes quite a long time

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.609 
those spikes takes quite a long time
when<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.159> watching<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.700> arm

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
when you're not watching it arm

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.289 
when you're not watching it arm
time-lapsed<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.159> put<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.460> our<00:01:20.640> rendering

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
time-lapsed then we put in our rendering

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
time-lapsed then we put in our rendering
which<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.259> am<00:01:22.530> using<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:23.070> pencil<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> very

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
which I am using my pencil at a very

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350 
which I am using my pencil at a very
flat<00:01:24.780> angle<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> put<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> details<00:01:26.939> in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
flat angle then I put in the details in

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
flat angle then I put in the details in
the<00:01:27.479> mouth<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> darker<00:01:29.600> this<00:01:30.600> video

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the mouth to make it darker this video

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
the mouth to make it darker this video
itself<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:32.869> time-lapsed<00:01:33.869> quick

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
itself is actually a time-lapsed quick

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.789 
itself is actually a time-lapsed quick
version<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.850> an<00:01:36.119> hour<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
version of what is actually an hour and

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.399 
version of what is actually an hour and
30<00:01:37.799> yard<00:01:38.189> minutes<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:39.960> want<00:01:40.229> me

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
30 yard minutes so if you really want me

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649 
30 yard minutes so if you really want me
to<00:01:40.560> upload<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> video<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.390> it's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to upload that video I will just it's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.780 
to upload that video I will just it's
gonna<00:01:42.810> take<00:01:43.049> quite<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.530> time<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
gonna take quite some time and in the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
gonna take quite some time and in the
meantime<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.180> thought<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:46.290> more<00:01:46.530> interesting

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
meantime I thought be more interesting

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.710 
meantime I thought be more interesting
watching<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.610> time-lapse<00:01:48.119> video<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> can

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
watching a time-lapse video so you can

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
watching a time-lapse video so you can
just<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.530> your<00:01:49.649> idea<00:01:50.189> watch<00:01:51.000> me<00:01:51.270> draw

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
just kind of get your idea watch me draw

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620 
just kind of get your idea watch me draw
along<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.409> put<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> scales<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.420> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
along as I put in the scales and this is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.289 
along as I put in the scales and this is
where<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.290> particular<00:01:55.649> drawing<00:01:56.490> gets<00:01:56.820> very

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
where this particular drawing gets very

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.260 
where this particular drawing gets very
detailed<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.170> scales<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.119> especially<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
detailed in scales and especially that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.209 
detailed in scales and especially that
frill<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.899> frill<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> lot

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
frill that frill is going to get a lot

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.889 
frill that frill is going to get a lot
of<00:02:02.460> some<00:02:03.390> spiky<00:02:03.960> scales<00:02:04.939> they<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.479> oh<00:02:06.600> saying

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of some spiky scales they like oh saying

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.020 
of some spiky scales they like oh saying
hola<00:02:07.290> I'll<00:02:07.860> put<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> I'll<00:02:08.340> put<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.879> video

those tiny little lines especially in

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.350 
those tiny little lines especially in
that<00:02:28.420> crest<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.050> around<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.700> frill<00:02:31.330> to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
that crest and around the the frill to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.990 
that crest and around the the frill to
indicate<00:02:32.140> skin<00:02:32.560> texture<00:02:32.950> also<00:02:33.580> putting<00:02:33.819> in

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
indicate skin texture also putting in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.930 
indicate skin texture also putting in
more<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.390> scales<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.220> line<00:02:36.220> folds<00:02:36.850> around

more of the scales and line folds around

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.080 
more of the scales and line folds around
the<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.840> my<00:02:40.840> trademark<00:02:41.800> grid<00:02:42.520> structure

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the I do my my trademark grid structure

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.160 
the I do my my trademark grid structure
for<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.890> snout<00:02:44.890> muscles

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
for the snout muscles

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.110 
for the snout muscles
not<00:02:47.170> muscle<00:02:47.350> skin<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.430> putting<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
not muscle skin and then putting the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.590 
not muscle skin and then putting the
lines<00:02:49.390> around<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.080> crest<00:02:50.380> hood<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:51.480> don't<00:02:52.480> know

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
lines around the crest hood I don't know

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.259 
lines around the crest hood I don't know
how<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.750> explain<00:02:53.140> it's<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> bit<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.950> a

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
how to explain it's just like a bit of a

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.690 
how to explain it's just like a bit of a
bit<00:02:55.269> of<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.480> texture<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.560> then<00:02:57.430> I'm<00:02:57.519> putting

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
bit of a texture to it then I'm putting

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.780 
bit of a texture to it then I'm putting
the<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.920> Tyrus<00:02:59.920> bit<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the that Tyrus bit that the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.520 
the that Tyrus bit that the
Dilophosaurus<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.750> famous<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:04.500> there<00:03:05.500> I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
Dilophosaurus is famous for there I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.410 
Dilophosaurus is famous for there I
messed<00:03:06.100> up<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.310> little<00:03:06.459> bit<00:03:06.610> by<00:03:06.730> erasing<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.269> but

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
messed up a little bit by erasing it but

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.640 
messed up a little bit by erasing it but
after<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> while<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.050> kinda<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.319> looks<00:03:08.590> like

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
after a while it kinda just looks like

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
after a while it kinda just looks like
it's<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> bit<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.190> motion<00:03:09.610> blur<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.120> don't

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
it's a bit of a motion blur so I don't

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.080 
it's a bit of a motion blur so I don't
mind<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.170> much<00:03:11.410> when<00:03:12.100> raising<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.580> this

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
mind that so much when raising it this

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.059 
mind that so much when raising it this
is<00:03:13.450> where<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.660> takes<00:03:13.840> quite<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.290> long<00:03:14.560> time<00:03:14.890> in

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
is where it takes quite a long time in

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.009 
is where it takes quite a long time in
the<00:03:15.190> actual<00:03:15.670> video<00:03:16.000> as<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.390> can<00:03:16.510> see<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.840> is

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
the actual video as you can see this is

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.979 
the actual video as you can see this is
like<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.100> last<00:03:18.310> quarter<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.329> this<00:03:19.510> video<00:03:19.810> so

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
like the last quarter of this video so

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.740 
like the last quarter of this video so
there's<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.350> lot<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.709> arm<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:21.750> indicating

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
there's a lot of arm just indicating

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.550 
there's a lot of arm just indicating
patterns<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.890> detail<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:25.030> go<00:03:25.299> try<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.140> give<00:03:26.440> it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
patterns and detail so go try to give it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.130 
patterns and detail so go try to give it
that<00:03:26.590> um<00:03:27.090> bit<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.239> pattern<00:03:28.540> there's<00:03:28.989> like<00:03:29.110> a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
that um bit of a pattern there's like a

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140 
that um bit of a pattern there's like a
two<00:03:29.500> spiral<00:03:30.070> pattern<00:03:30.430> along<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
two spiral pattern along the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.090 
two spiral pattern along the
Dilophosaurus<00:03:31.870> feel<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.410> noticed<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
Dilophosaurus feel that I noticed and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.340 
Dilophosaurus feel that I noticed and
also<00:03:33.820> using<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.269> lot<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:35.220> triangular<00:03:36.220> scales<00:03:37.350> so

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
also using a lot of triangular scales so

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.810 
also using a lot of triangular scales so
I<00:03:38.380> was<00:03:38.470> basically<00:03:38.769> wanting<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.250> do<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.640> with

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
I was basically wanting to do that with

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.440 
I was basically wanting to do that with
the<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.750> frill<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.320> just<00:03:42.190> lots<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.180> that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
the the frill and just lots of that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.930 
the the frill and just lots of that
basically<00:03:44.190> making<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.519> bit<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.850> a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
basically making that a bit of a

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.830 
basically making that a bit of a
zigzaggy<00:03:46.450> cube<00:03:47.140> um<00:03:48.359> some<00:03:49.359> of<00:03:49.450> them<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> bit

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
zigzaggy cube um some of them a bit

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.690 
zigzaggy cube um some of them a bit
diamond<00:03:50.320> like<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.920> then<00:03:51.040> some<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.340> them<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.519> bit

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
diamond like and then some of them a bit

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.810 
diamond like and then some of them a bit
zig<00:03:51.940> zaggy<00:03:52.359> then<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:53.430> refining<00:03:54.430> all<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
zig zaggy then just refining all the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.210 
zig zaggy then just refining all the
detail<00:03:55.239> from<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.480> point<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:55.989> now<00:03:56.920> what

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
detail from that point on now what

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.340 
detail from that point on now what
you're<00:03:57.400> about<00:03:57.609> to<00:03:57.790> see<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.390> other<00:03:59.049> than

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
you're about to see is other than

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.930 
you're about to see is other than
putting<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.250> extra<00:04:00.579> little<00:04:00.700> fine

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
putting a little extra little fine

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.870 
putting a little extra little fine
