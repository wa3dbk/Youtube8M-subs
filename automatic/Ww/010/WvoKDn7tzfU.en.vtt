clarity<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.080> quite<00:02:07.409> as

clarity I would say it's not quite as

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.219 
clarity I would say it's not quite as
lush<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> Bumi<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.849> Rosewood<00:02:09.299> but<00:02:10.019> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
lush and Bumi as the Rosewood but that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.420 
lush and Bumi as the Rosewood but that
clarity<00:02:12.319> really<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.530> carries<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.040> day<00:02:14.189> on

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
