00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.000
fill the void inside

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
feed the strange plan to hide

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.000
fear the voice outside,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
feel the need to collide

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.500
I aim the face of people merely amused

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.900
and I feel ashamed,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.500
they're all so easily abused

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.400
there's a dark seed hung deep inside,
there's no escape, there's no turning back

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.900
the starving is useless and will just leave you faithless

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.400
embrace the day of your come back,
coz' your power's still intact

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.400
open your hands and grab all you can,
it's for yourself after all

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.000
there's a dark seed hung deep inside,
there's no escape, there's no turning back

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000
lost myself

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.000
out of my thoughts,
into a silent space of truth

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.400
I drain my faith,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.500
tired to have fought
this nameless hunger we try to soothe

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.900
blind you are,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.900
missing what I am inside

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.400
hide until it's time,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:37.000
I rest underground

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.400
confusing the skyline,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.900
I'm laying underneath
trapped around your bruised flesh,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.400
I'm waiting for blood

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.400
poisoning the mankind,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.400
I'm spreading the disease
insufflating power,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
whispering you're mine now

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.500
things running wild and I'm feeling the force,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.500
slowly, I'm going through the perversion of innocence

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.400
fears lost in time 'cause I'm hearing the voice

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.500
shouting,
calling for something that is full of dissonance

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.400
there's a dark seed hung deep inside,
there's no escape, there's no turning back

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.900
the starving is useless and will just leave you faithless

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.900
embrace the day of your come back,
coz' your power's still intact

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.900
open your hands and grab all you can,
it's for yourself after all

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
there's a dark seed hung deep inside,
there's no escape, there's no turning back

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.500
slowly,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I'm drifting again,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500
I disappear,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.500
I'm invisible

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.900
sailing through the silence,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.900
along the lines of fate

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I'm waiting for the moment to arise out of the gaze

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.900
I'm fading away

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.900
into a dark and stinking alley
where the shadows,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.900
oh the shadows
now show me a way close to your soul

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.400
like thundering,
I'm falling,
embracing all I'm meant to be

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:49.000
and I feel some appeasement
when you're in me
