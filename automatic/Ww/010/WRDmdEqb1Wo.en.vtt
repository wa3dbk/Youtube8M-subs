00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 welcome to this little spin off i 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.890
 nilesat freddy's file we will interpret in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.160
 first person 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.860
 fox is the time listening to her 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 thoughts and his desire to escape 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.619
 from solitude 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.619
 today we talk about the desire for fox 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.420
 this place is abandoned by many 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.210
 days that our voices are true 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.329
 pizzeria is really asking is true 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.110
 that we will be abandoned and true that 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.350
 probably no one will want to buy us 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.350
 it is not right to go back in the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.059
 time to understand why I was 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.360
 left alone 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:59.650
 especially because they isolated me 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.250
 inside this room now I remember the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.250
 bite 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.479
 how I wish I hadn't done it I don't know 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.320
 because I did it 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.320
 I only know that cold and others do not 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.860
 They never brought so much attention 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.110
 when I broke the rule but I didn't 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.090
 I want to be alone 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.740
 where can I find another friend 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.990
 animatronic 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.990
 think of it well yes the night watchman 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.570
 I could make friends the others 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.539
 they are trying to take it for some 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.630
 reason they probably want to put it 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:47.049
 inside a costume and make friends with me are 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.670
 a little shy I admit he doesn't stare at me 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.500
 the camera can't even get to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.960
 move 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.580
 it's probably a terrible idea but 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.119
 I have to try 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.799
 I'm tired of being alone and then I am 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.899
 a pirate 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.840
 I have to go get my friend or 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.510
 agree the only thing i'm good at 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.770
 it's more that race 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.420
 Please don't close the door I hope not 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.540
 it's too late 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.700
 yes the door is open I finally have it 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.430
 made in the face of an expression of 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.670
 terror but once it becomes mine 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.010
 friend won't be scared anymore mine 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.740
 new friend and a bit shy he didn't 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.000
 still said nothing but in the end succeed in 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.160
 feeling his joyful company is beautiful 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.920
 have someone to talk to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.250
 I can't wait for you to start telling me 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.250
 something 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.840
 with this I finished the story though 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.760
