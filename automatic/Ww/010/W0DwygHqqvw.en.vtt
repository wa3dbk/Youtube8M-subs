00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.760
 hello how are we here in another 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.120
 video more today we are going to make a 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.940
 tutorial very easy and very fast 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.340
 how to make your own would be had your 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.450
 glue to stick this your figures on 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.610
 your fondant cake or paste paste 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.100
 very very simple me what I am 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.400
 used here is the dust tie 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.180
 what would be this I have recommended a lot 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.090
 much in all the videos this dust that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.390
 is to make in the paste paste taylos 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.450
 there is also the cmc too and it is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.900
 also the gun text of the wilton also 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.290
 it's the same result of these three 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.950
 powders for this job well then here 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.040
 I have this demonstration I already have 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.399
 here prepared look like that you have to stay 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.860
 it does not have to be very liquid or have 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.460
 to be very thick that's how it has 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.480
 to stay our rubber or in our 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 glue for 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.920
 in our cake it is very simple this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 tutorial I already have here pretty 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 because because I use a lot and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.380
 I work a lot very much all this the fondant 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.870
 So they fall, it suits me to have it for 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.350
 a lot of time here you have to have it very 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.570
 well sealed 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.490
 I have in this same that from half 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.210
 of which I ended up here myself 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.670
 I have saved what is my good rubber 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 I'm going to put it aside 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.650
 in this other one that is going to be because nothing 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.110
 more to have these two tubes I put half and 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.270
 those on this side this cap and I'm going to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.869
 work here has to have you 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.939
 a cap that is very well sealed that does not 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.000
 I caught him in the air because they remember that 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.670
 this is to harden and it is done as 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.649
 gelatinous is that they dry very 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 fast if you have it outdoors good 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.700
 let's start what you're going to need 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.190
 is 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:07.770
 medium and spoon here is half of stems 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.500
 and you are going to occupy 5 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.450
 tape facebook here are the others are 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 these tribes point just need what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.250
 which are five of this for half kind of 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.420
 tai here we have it good we go to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.750
 we need first do I already have 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.580
 water here we are going to measure our five 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.560
 this point would not be our tribes 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.130
 five tablespoons a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.130
 two 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.750
 4 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.459
 and here is 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.790
 here I have my 5 facebook.com and 5 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.280
 tablespoons of regular water is water 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.150
 of the refrigerator from which you take 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.150
 good 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.980
 I'm going to grab my media has to be at 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:10.730
 It's not up to the is here, it's like that 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.430
 how it is measured that it has to be flush 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.340
 spoonful is your average disc medium point 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.340
 spoonful here is I'm going to put it 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.790
 and quickly I'm going to shake it I'm going to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.340
 mix try to mix because it's done 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.340
 balls are made balls as lumps 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.040
 let's quickly mix everything 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.920
 Anyway right now if it stays that way 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.920
 as pellets or lumps, it does not matter 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.180
 let's leave and for tomorrow you 're going to 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.180
 be completely 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.760
 It is completely hydrated 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.880
 gelatinous does not last nor very watery either 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.560
 for tomorrow it will be fine as it should be 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.200
 look like the one I just showed you 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.860
 right now it will look like this look 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.709
 they are set as lumps in the water but 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.510
 little by little it is going to break down by itself 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.510
 in the process of time 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.200
 the water is starting to see a little 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.890
 more gelatinous it no longer looks so liquid 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.890
 how it looked 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.900
 here is 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.699
 this is very useful for when you 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.069
 they work for example their designs in their 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.889
 Pastries want to be sticking figures 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.620
 it's very very good very very good is 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.419
 just do the same job the water 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.849
 it also uses a struggle here 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.639
 but this account is a little more 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.220
 safer with this one because it hits more 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.520
 fast still the water sometimes slips 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.800
 in certain this figures or things that you 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.740
 you're hitting and this is a little bit more 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.440
 sticky so it's that you have the best 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.840
 still work quality on your cake 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.270
 in your designs although right now it's going to be 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.020
 impossible to thwart the 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.789
 What will I do'll close well 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.789
 shake it well well well well well 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.449
 we are going to shake it very well but as you 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.990
 I comment 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.340
 This is going to be falling apart through 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.040
 the hours 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.310
 for tomorrow and advance I recommend them 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.500
 still that in 24 hours they do not have to 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.250
 put in the refrigerator can leave them to 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.250
 temperature 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.700
 well here we are going to leave 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.810
 in the end you will have 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:52.740
 this result that would be this is my life 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.100
 well that house look good and gelatinous 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.590
 but not hard there it is and it will give you 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.030
 quite enough time is going to render you 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.100
 this because you will only need it 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.680
 to paste figures what are you 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.150
 working on your background to remember 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.790
 that does not have to hit the air 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.060
 because it dries very soon so it 's that 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.270
 let's continue this and we have a list 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.720
 the other part we're going to let her do 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.600
 your work for 24 hours and ready 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.780
 Well, it was very simple and very fast 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.910
 this tutorial 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.550
 I hope you like it and I know it's going 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.770
 to be very useful this this glue is 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.930
 rubber to work your figures or your 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.050
 flowers or what you work on your 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.490
 cake well thank you very much I hope that 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.830
