wonders<00:01:58.070> next<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.399> some<00:01:59.820> lip<00:02:00.329> colors<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
wonders next I have some lip colors and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
wonders next I have some lip colors and
these<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.610> butter<00:02:03.000> lip<00:02:03.360> glosses<00:02:03.630> from

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
these are the butter lip glosses from

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.280 
these are the butter lip glosses from
NYX<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.340> they<00:02:05.700> look<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.110> are

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
NYX so they look like this and these are

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.430 
NYX so they look like this and these are
some<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> newest<00:02:08.160> ones

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
some of the newest ones

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440 
some of the newest ones
so<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.160> think<00:02:10.430> these<00:02:10.520> are<00:02:10.580> perfect<00:02:10.880> for<00:02:11.210> spring

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
so I think these are perfect for spring

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.060 
so I think these are perfect for spring
and<00:02:11.540> summer<00:02:11.630> because<00:02:12.140> they're<00:02:12.620> very

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
and summer because they're very

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.550 
and summer because they're very
pigmented<00:02:13.520> they<00:02:14.180> smell<00:02:14.540> really<00:02:14.600> good<00:02:14.900> now

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
pigmented they smell really good now

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.440 
pigmented they smell really good now
they're<00:02:15.710> not<00:02:15.860> too<00:02:16.340> long<00:02:16.610> lasting<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.300> your

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
they're not too long lasting on your

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.900 
they're not too long lasting on your
lips<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.290> mean<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.830> doesn't<00:02:19.100> bother<00:02:19.370> me<00:02:19.580> to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
lips but I mean it doesn't bother me to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.090 
lips but I mean it doesn't bother me to
keep<00:02:20.090> reapplying<00:02:20.480> my<00:02:20.780> lip<00:02:20.930> gloss<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.920> just

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
keep reapplying my lip gloss and I just

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.910 
keep reapplying my lip gloss and I just
think<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> color<00:02:22.610> payoff<00:02:22.940> makes<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.080> work<00:02:24.260> so

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
think the color payoff makes it work so

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.420 
think the color payoff makes it work so
these<00:02:25.340> are<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.820> new<00:02:26.240> ones<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.890> first<00:02:28.190> one<00:02:28.400> is

these are for new ones the first one is
angel<00:02:29.180> food<00:02:29.450> cake<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.990> it's<00:02:30.140> like<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.440> nudie

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
angel food cake and it's like a nudie

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920 
angel food cake and it's like a nudie
shade<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.520> think<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.120> one's<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.630> really

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930

which<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> purpley<00:02:38.780> shade<00:02:39.190> which<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.310> think

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
which is a purpley shade which I think

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.830 
which is a purpley shade which I think
all<00:02:40.670> these<00:02:40.940> are<00:02:41.120> going<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.300> look<00:02:41.390> really<00:02:41.600> good

i<00:06:36.429> think<00:06:36.489> this<00:06:36.789> if<00:06:37.089> you<00:06:37.359> don't<00:06:37.569> have<00:06:37.749> this<00:06:37.929> for

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
i think this if you don't have this for

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.169 
i think this if you don't have this for
spring<00:06:38.409> and<00:06:38.439> summer<00:06:38.669> you're<00:06:39.669> missing<00:06:40.059> out

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:40.179 
spring and summer you're missing out

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.629 
spring and summer you're missing out
because<00:06:40.449> it<00:06:41.079> just<00:06:41.379> makes<00:06:41.829> your<00:06:42.039> eyebrows<00:06:42.429> look

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
because it just makes your eyebrows look

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.719 
because it just makes your eyebrows look
perfect<00:06:42.699> and<00:06:43.359> you<00:06:43.719> can<00:06:43.899> also<00:06:44.079> use<00:06:44.259> the<00:06:44.769> brow

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
perfect and you can also use the brow

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.759 
perfect and you can also use the brow
wax<00:06:46.119> that<00:06:46.389> they<00:06:46.569> have<00:06:46.779> or<00:06:47.079> the<00:06:47.259> little<00:06:47.409> pot

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:47.769 
wax that they have or the little pot

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:50.219 
wax that they have or the little pot
with<00:06:48.219> the<00:06:48.369> wax<00:06:48.579> in<00:06:48.879> it<00:06:48.909> to<00:06:49.539> keep<00:06:49.689> your<00:06:49.899> eyebrows
