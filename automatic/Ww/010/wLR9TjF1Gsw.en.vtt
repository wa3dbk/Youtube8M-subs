the compact bus and light bulb so now

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.420 
the compact bus and light bulb so now
the<00:01:34.350> first<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.220> make

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the first thing you want to do is make

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.179 
the first thing you want to do is make
sure<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:38.420> neutralize<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.979> capacitor<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
sure you neutralize the capacitor so I

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.670 
sure you neutralize the capacitor so I
use<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.700> screwdriver<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.960> touch<00:01:43.320> people's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
use a screwdriver to touch people's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.310 
use a screwdriver to touch people's
positive<00:01:44.250> terminal<00:01:45.180> together<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:46.110> will

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
positive terminal together that will

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.830 
positive terminal together that will
neutralize<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.579> capacitor<00:01:48.420> once<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> do

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
neutralize the capacitor once you do

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.100 
neutralize the capacitor once you do
that<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.470> cut<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.909> capacitor<00:01:51.689> out

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that you can cut the capacitor out

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.080 
that you can cut the capacitor out
okay<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> don't<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:53.070> shocked<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
okay so you don't get shocked now you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
okay so you don't get shocked now you
can<00:01:54.270> save<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> capacitor<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.259> other

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
can save the capacitor for other

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260 
can save the capacitor for other
projects<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:57.119> don't

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
projects was I'm going to do they don't

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:06.360 
projects was I'm going to do they don't
mean

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.210 

okay<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.430> once<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:08.000> remove<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:08.590> capacitor<00:02:09.590> I'm

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
okay so once I remove that capacitor I'm

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.900 
okay so once I remove that capacitor I'm
gonna<00:02:10.429> use<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:11.000> on<00:02:11.440> my<00:02:12.440> project<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.370> keep<00:02:13.700> that
