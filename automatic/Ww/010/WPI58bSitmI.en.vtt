00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.500
 then we are asked to project me 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 all the people we're going to go to now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 interview that I collaborate in this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.689
 big project then asks me how 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.680
 is going 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.970
 they looked great as you can see 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.619
 argument the best the box rearrange 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.790
 how it takes to load them in alessandro 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.410
 davide claude giorgio massimo and all 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 this collaborates to the realization 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.399
 project is not a project if I say tk 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.680
 a project of all these 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.379
 groups that will give the big one a hand 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 success of this extraordinary evening 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.120
 then alessandro is a great man 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.770
 that will end this great evening 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.059
 I think it's success announced 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.449
 imperative interaction we are having 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.580
 with everyone and it is very and very union of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.170
 and group and we firmly believe this 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 project, however, then later with the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 super combating in the year selections 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.790
 next one 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 and it is a project that applies very well 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.689
 because the people they agreed to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.640
 collaborate for the situation are i 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.990
 best in univano in Italy then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.390
 surely it will be a success 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 feel the evening will be extraordinary but

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.320
 giorgio castoldi 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.110
 we are obviously talking about pro fighting and 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.700
 especially the importance of having one 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.950
 important stride to involve the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.139
 best athletes especially Italians 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.389

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.960
 as a spokesperson for prof. prof 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.280
 we are proud to say, to say the least 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.930
 part in this great event where 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.689
 michele paffetti is making some 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.729
 really heavy guys efforts me 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.189
 I only realized today at the meeting 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.680
 what he is putting all come to monza 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.969
 because it will be real boys show 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.300
 now we cannot give advances 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.949
 but there is a hot fight that there are so many 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.110
 the surprises that will come nissim e 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.969
 they will surprise you here not to be missed 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.580
 I think it's a unique event in his 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.960
 genre part style holland the two of the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.800
 afternoon boys and two in the afternoon 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.569
 we start with in the fight and they will be 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.849
 already level at 11 noon 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.520
 imagine what can be us in the evening 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.259
 as pro fighting we are proud of 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.819
 collaborate with this acronym with the 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.789
 boutique in agreement with michele paffetti 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:37.060
 with his staff and participate in super 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:40.479
 koman which I believe is the arrival for a 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.400
 athlete but not the finish which is the end for 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.770
 a beginning for a law of something 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.379
 big because super kombat is true 22 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.439
 November to monza from the show but then 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.819
 what will follow is a project that 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:55.089
 in my opinion not to whom as in 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.229
 next days we will discover the fi card 

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:00.669
 we do n't want an amen 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.110
 unfortunately it cannot be shortly shortly 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.930
 we will find out everything ok 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.990
 don't miss monza November 22nd then 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.000
 we continue and with maximum tolini e 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.430
 nothing what do you think about this 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.289
 project but I think only in large 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.899
 this point given that with the music makes 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.149
 we must always think only big 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:21.430
 then he just thought why the facts are 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:24.129
 these sandals with us as to what 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.610
 which concerns standards is an opportunity 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.610
 unrepeatable 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.389
 for many this is a point of arrival 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.210
 day is instead here we are leaving 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.280
 already with a project maybe already for the 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.400
 next year the sun from here to one 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.680
 visibility I also think of the world 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.000
 no type of event has ever offered there 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.220
 sandra will be a meeting this 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.900
 then we just have to renew 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.669
 the invitation to everyone to buy tickets 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.710
 before they are exhausted and come 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.180
 obviously on November 22nd in c 2 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.610
 November everyone at monza the voyeur 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.250
 then he asks me for a final joke but 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.750
 final place that I am proud point 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.870
 to have set up this team 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:08.349
 fantastic boutique has always appeared 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.880
