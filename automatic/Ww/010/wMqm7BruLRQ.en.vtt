so<00:02:06.219> I'm<00:02:06.430> going<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.880> actually<00:02:07.800> take<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.830> one

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
so I'm going to actually take that one

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.339 
so I'm going to actually take that one
instead<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> cheapest<00:02:10.149> offer<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.959> so

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
instead of the cheapest offer so so

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.900 
instead of the cheapest offer so so
we're<00:02:11.470> going<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.650> allow<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.860> airline<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.550> to

we're going to allow the airline to to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.449 
we're going to allow the airline to to
have<00:02:13.030> phase<00:02:13.330> different<00:02:13.780> ways<00:02:13.989> of<00:02:14.260> giving<00:02:15.099> more

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
have phase different ways of giving more

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.059 
have phase different ways of giving more
information<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> point<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.870> sale<00:02:17.140> fur<00:02:17.769> to

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
information to the point of sale fur to

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.809 
information to the point of sale fur to
sell<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.150> any<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:20.019> essence<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.890> equipping

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
sell so any in essence is it equipping

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.290 
sell so any in essence is it equipping

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
types of functions that airlines are

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.970 
types of functions that airlines are
using<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.940> their<00:02:28.450> websites<00:02:28.840> today<00:02:29.530> it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
using on their websites today it's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.009 
using on their websites today it's
equipping<00:02:30.430> them<00:02:30.519> with<00:02:30.580> similar<00:02:31.360> function<00:02:31.750> it

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
equipping them with similar function it

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.110 
equipping them with similar function it
cannot<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.500> identical<00:02:33.340> because<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.790> selling

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
cannot be identical because the selling

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.820 
cannot be identical because the selling
process<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.540> slightly<00:02:34.750> adapted<00:02:35.349> but<00:02:35.680> what

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
process is slightly adapted but what

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.160 
process is slightly adapted but what
we're<00:02:35.980> doing<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.480> end<00:02:37.630> delivering

for<00:03:49.630> him<00:03:49.889> so<00:03:50.889> what<00:03:51.040> we<00:03:51.160> did<00:03:51.340> with<00:03:51.519> tickler<00:03:51.819> Zach

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
for him so what we did with tickler Zach

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.809 
for him so what we did with tickler Zach
says<00:03:52.299> we<00:03:52.810> developed<00:03:53.319> a<00:03:53.440> solution<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:54.160> meant

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
says we developed a solution that meant

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.910 
says we developed a solution that meant
he<00:03:54.910> didn't<00:03:55.389> have<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.569> change<00:03:55.989> anything<00:03:56.590> he

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
he didn't have to change anything he

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.720 
he didn't have to change anything he
does<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.670> basically<00:03:58.859> adapted<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.980> GDS<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.639> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
does we basically adapted the GDS to the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.910 
does we basically adapted the GDS to the
way<00:04:00.880> they<00:04:01.090> work<00:04:01.389> and<00:04:01.690> they<00:04:02.200> said<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.620> made<00:04:02.799> it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
way they work and they said that made it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.920 
way they work and they said that made it
a<00:04:03.010> lot<00:04:03.130> easier<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:04.030> lot<00:04:04.150> less<00:04:04.209> costly<00:04:04.720> to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
a lot easier and a lot less costly to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.539 
a lot easier and a lot less costly to
work<00:04:05.079> for<00:04:05.290> their<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.829> GDS<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.400> that's

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
work for their with the GDS and that's

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.720 
work for their with the GDS and that's
why<00:04:06.670> now<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.000> have<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:07.389> much<00:04:07.510> success
