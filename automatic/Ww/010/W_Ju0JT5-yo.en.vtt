 mute to our TV and then click 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.720
 on input and see if ours 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.280
 TV interacts correctly

 we can manage dvd and blu ray tv 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.090
 the interface is pleasant as already mentioned 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.149
 we have the possibility to switch on 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.579
 turn off the TV until about 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.409
 four meters away at least me 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.210
 up to 4 meters but I didn't have any 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.689
 kind of problem just point the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.270
 television like you see click e 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.680
 the TV has been turned off 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 we turn it back on you see it without any kind 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 of problem we have rekindled it possible 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.700
 we have the remote control on 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.680
 this application 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.849
 completely and completely because we have 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.459
 the possibility of managing ours 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.780
 not all favorite channels 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.400
 because the TV really looks at it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.840
 really just looks sad 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.500
 days to test the phone 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.500
 possibility to manage the volume 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.689
 possibility to manage the mute 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.170
 possibility to manage the exchange rate change 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:45.639
 channel 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.379
 let's try also the one you see we have 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.519
 changed channel without any kind of 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.530
 problem 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.019
 we also have the possibility to manage 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.970
 the push button bay for changing the 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.720
 change channel and manage the last channel 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.459
 which we have we have sought 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.709
 let's try that too 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.650
 we return to five and see we are 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.139
 back to channel 5 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.659
 in addition to this clicking input we will have the 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:17.859
 ability to manage as you can 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.780
 see all the various sections of 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.419
 TV input so if 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.680
 for example we want to go on sky to go 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:28.389
 on other things we can safely 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.310
 do it directly from our all 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.979
 our phone without needing to 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.239
 use the remote control because not 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.690
 supports for example the function 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.720
 by clicking less we have all the varies 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.959
 various push-button panel with the possibility of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.790
 click for example on com to manage 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.970
 see the menu here is the menu 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:57.030
 TV's main possibility of 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.030
 also manage network with the pad 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.860
 all the various section also of the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.230
 TV possibility to click then i 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.069
 menu go back in the selection 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.879
 get out have five classic buttons 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.829
 of the TV here it is you see i 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.829
 five classic colored buttons 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:28.010
 let's go now let's see the second one 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.949
 way to interact with the TV 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.800
 the second type of interface it puts 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.310
 which imposes a simplified interface 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.080
 with the ability to change channels e 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.639
 change volume only by dragging the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.169
 wheel this wheel upward 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.550
 down or sideways 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.280
 in addition to that we always have the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.169
 possibility to manage all the various 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.789
 canary changes possibility go into the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:55.130
 usual menu to manage the various inputs and the 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.560
 default channel this application 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.560
 you can even if it can also reach 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.360
 let's change a little channel you see without 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.410
 any kind of problem 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.520
 this application can also be had 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:16.520
 exiting in the screen lock by clicking the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.500
 home button that it works a lot 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.750
 well if not for the impossibility of 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.389
 turn the TV on or off from 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.130
 from this interface anyway 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.740
 ability to change volume change 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.610
 channel and see we change channel without 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.410
 any kind of problem and possibility 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.320
 also to return to the application 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.300
 full much very quickly you see 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.150
 our screen lock remains here 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.050
 pressing beyond that we could also 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.030
 manage quick remote from the curtain 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.800
 Notifications will certainly take us a lot 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.810
 much space the problem is the same as 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.990
 we can't turn off the TV 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.180
 or turn it on for I think for a bacchus of 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:02.930
 system directly here 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:05.300
 clicking the power button but anyway 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.000
 is a great way to check 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.639
 very quickly our remote control 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.860
 this application with its battery 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.780
 this use of the phone as a remote control 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.569
 with its battery absolutely not because 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.159
 however it transmits impulses 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:22.249
 only when we will recommend then 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:24.020
 it is not a continuous thing there is not at all 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:28.159
 a continuous synchronization between the 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.960
 phone is the TV 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.779
 these all we do not have the management of 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.689
 for example of teletext for example 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.719
 directly from the terminal we do not have 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:43.340
 the management of the programs that will be the 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:45.349
 evening the same day as other others 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.539
 applications like that but I can 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.300
 to ensure that it is really good for 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.009
 simply manage the television 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.419
 having the phone at hand maybe not 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.560
 wanting to get up to take the 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.020
 TV remote 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.340
 on the opposite side of the sofa what 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.099
 even fun to turn off TVs 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:05.710
 in the bars for this is all a greeting from 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.710
