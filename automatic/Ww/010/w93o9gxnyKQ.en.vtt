00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.550 

here's<00:00:02.180> the<00:00:02.389> old<00:00:02.510> engine

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.110 

step<00:00:06.560> off<00:00:06.740> this<00:00:07.010> one<00:00:07.310> he<00:00:07.610> was<00:00:07.700> on<00:00:07.850> the<00:00:08.000> other

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
step off this one he was on the other

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.459 
step off this one he was on the other
engine<00:00:08.510> we<00:00:08.600> had<00:00:08.750> to<00:00:09.400> stuff<00:00:10.400> didn't<00:00:10.730> match<00:00:10.880> up

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
engine we had to stuff didn't match up

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:20.130 
engine we had to stuff didn't match up
so<00:00:12.469> our<00:00:13.040> body<00:00:13.310> had<00:00:13.580> to<00:00:13.700> go<00:00:13.850> on<00:00:14.090> the<00:00:14.360> new<00:00:14.480> one<00:00:14.660> did

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.750 

one<00:00:20.650> for<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:20.890> RAM<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.830> see<00:00:24.160> this<00:00:24.430> is<00:00:24.610> the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
one for the RAM you see this is the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.720 
one for the RAM you see this is the
actual<00:00:24.940> old<00:00:25.390> engine<00:00:25.900> right<00:00:26.050> here<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:27.310> my<00:00:27.490> hand

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
actual old engine right here in my hand

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.860 
actual old engine right here in my hand
that's<00:00:27.970> left<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.660> my<00:00:29.070> number<00:00:30.070> one<00:00:30.250> piston<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.490 

that's<00:00:35.440> what<00:00:35.740> you<00:00:35.860> see<00:00:36.070> right<00:00:36.250> there<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:38.110> you

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
that's what you see right there and you

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:47.090 
that's what you see right there and you
can<00:00:38.620> see<00:00:38.880> down<00:00:39.880> there<00:00:40.180> I<00:00:40.210> guess

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.220 

over<00:00:48.100> here

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.380 

there's<00:00:51.530> my<00:00:51.769> old<00:00:51.800> oil<00:00:52.399> pan<00:00:52.699> from<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.120> engine

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
there's my old oil pan from this engine

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.950 
there's my old oil pan from this engine
from<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.170> old<00:00:54.350> engine

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.160 

and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.640> there's<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.880> engine<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.990> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and then there's the engine from the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.030 
and then there's the engine from the
salvage<00:01:01.740> yard<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:02.250> there

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
salvage yard right there

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.190 
salvage yard right there
and<00:01:05.320> went<00:01:06.320> ahead<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:07.600> did<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.660> compression

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
and went ahead and I did a compression

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.220 
and went ahead and I did a compression
check<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.930> seven<00:01:11.930> out<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.200> eight

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
check and seven out of the eight

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.540 
check and seven out of the eight
cylinders<00:01:12.800> have<00:01:13.010> zero<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:15.500> number<00:01:15.980> seven

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
cylinders have zero and the number seven

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.440 
cylinders have zero and the number seven
solar<00:01:16.850> at<00:01:17.300> 20<00:01:18.260> psi

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
solar at 20 psi

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.260 
solar at 20 psi
right<00:01:21.049> now<00:01:21.200> I've<00:01:21.409> got<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.759> hose<00:01:22.759> hooked<00:01:22.939> up<00:01:23.150> to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
right now I've got a hose hooked up to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.609 
right now I've got a hose hooked up to
the<00:01:23.390> number<00:01:23.659> one<00:01:24.020> cylinder<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:26.439> I'm<00:01:27.439> going<00:01:27.590> to

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
the number one cylinder and I'm going to

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.780 
the number one cylinder and I'm going to
energize<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.259> compressed<00:01:30.259> air<00:01:30.790> hang

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
energize it with the compressed air hang

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.460 
energize it with the compressed air hang
on<00:01:31.909> one<00:01:32.119> second<00:01:32.570> I'll<00:01:32.659> get<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.049> hose<00:01:33.229> on

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
on one second I'll get this hose on

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:50.420 
on one second I'll get this hose on
there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.000 

all<00:01:51.430> right<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:51.880> we<00:01:51.970> got<00:01:52.120> energized<00:01:52.690> air<00:01:53.620> cover

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
all right so we got energized air cover

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.060 
all right so we got energized air cover
through<00:01:54.280> there

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.480 

right<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.910> we<00:01:58.060> got<00:01:58.180> air<00:01:58.420> coming<00:01:58.690> out<00:01:59.490> here

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
right here we got air coming out here

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.529 
right here we got air coming out here
building<00:02:00.910> up

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.770 

all<00:02:09.989> right<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.829> just<00:02:11.819> give<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> an<00:02:12.239> idea<00:02:12.390> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
all right so just give you an idea that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.570 
all right so just give you an idea that
it<00:02:12.930> actually<00:02:13.140> is

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.990 

it<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.170> it's<00:02:21.470> blowing<00:02:22.130> away<00:02:22.190> so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
it is right and it's blowing away so

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.090 
it is right and it's blowing away so
there<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.360> go<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.440> have<00:02:24.560> air<00:02:24.740> coming<00:02:24.950> out

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
there you go do you have air coming out

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100 
there you go do you have air coming out
of<00:02:25.130> PCV

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
of PCV

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.350 
of PCV
or<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:28.130> go<00:02:28.340> whichever<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.240> like

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
or you go whichever one that is like

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.100 
or you go whichever one that is like
yeah<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.510> remember

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
yeah I remember

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.059 
yeah I remember
come<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.590> over<00:02:31.830> here

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
come on over here

00:02:33.069 --> 00:03:09.170 
come on over here
you<00:02:33.519> got<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.879> kill<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.019> plug<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.409> up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.160 

so

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.320 
so
mechanic<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.099> I'm<00:03:13.370> talking<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:14.000> about<00:03:14.120> it

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
mechanic that I'm talking to about it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.540 
mechanic that I'm talking to about it
he's<00:03:15.020> come<00:03:15.260> out<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.590> poked<00:03:15.830> around<00:03:16.010> at<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.489> a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
he's come out and poked around at it a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.920 
he's come out and poked around at it a
little<00:03:16.670> bit

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
little bit

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.289 
little bit
telling<00:03:18.530> me<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:19.069> most<00:03:19.700> likely<00:03:20.150> this

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
telling me that it's most likely this

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.809 
telling me that it's most likely this
motor<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.780> jumped<00:03:21.140> I'm<00:03:21.349> pretty<00:03:21.739> bad<00:03:24.819> that's

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
motor is jumped I'm pretty bad that's

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.140 
motor is jumped I'm pretty bad that's
about<00:03:26.090> all<00:03:26.239> we<00:03:26.420> can<00:03:26.540> gather<00:03:26.720> from<00:03:27.140> it

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
about all we can gather from it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.040 
about all we can gather from it
that's<00:03:29.720> all<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.900> got<00:03:30.170> right<00:03:30.200> now

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.750 

I<00:03:34.140> guess<00:03:34.710> we'll<00:03:34.890> see<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.550> say

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
I guess we'll see here what you say

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.270 
I guess we'll see here what you say
Thanks
