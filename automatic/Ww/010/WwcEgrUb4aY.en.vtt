 primer potion alive with what I did the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.560
 base will have used this fantastic 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.950
 foundation of which soon 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.530
 we will talk in my opinion that the minor powder 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.510
 by goch the color is 0 0 4 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.550
 I put it did a little concealer but 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.770
 I could also avoid this in black 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:24.320
 no no no no no but this but where 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:27.170
 six of meat to me and I at this time 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.950
 powder I put it takes with the eg 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 this ritual face I used this 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.570
 bronze here 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.880
 this to debora's bronzing 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:46.160
 this was 03 and then a break of max 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.040
 meanwhile also seen the garniers here it is 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.830
 here then the max blush this is 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.800
 called flora power 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.790
 this is the color and it is written like this in 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.410
 French and power in English then 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.410
 eyebrows with the historic pencil 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.150
 anastasia berliski os 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.280
 then if I'm not mistaken enough I didn't put it 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.550
 I've already done it at the base 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.890
 then we start from the base to the hour on 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.720
 the whole eye will go to put a color 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.430
 gold or fastback from the naked 2 but 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.910
 that if I'm not mistaken chopin and the naked 1 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.709
 with this golden color and voila in the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.300
 external fold of the eye from the niche 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.519
 1 I go instead to use bach and with 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.720
 a small brush I will put bach 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.670
 also below, step up again 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.239
 more color I go to put in the pool 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.560
 here in the outer street I put some 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.540
 snakebite and I have already faded 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.860
 I changed my mind I'm not going to put 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.260
 nothing underneath I just keep on like that 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.090
 I will lose fading by pretty well we already put it 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.790
 also the illuminant since we are there 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.459
 between one and the other 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.610
 I would say I take boutique at the boutique or 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.160
 from the naked 2 this color I was from here 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.440
 put under the eyebrow arch 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.480
 I run after him and what stuff 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.459
 to purple eyeliner I also put 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.010
 the illuminant now we move to 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.729
 eyeliner what 's there I do n't think of you 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.830
 interests that of this turquoise not of 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.100
 I would tell you kiko to make a line 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.050
 beautiful a little that we actually see tie 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.580
 how it comes to me we see what comes out 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.080
 and to say that I am satisfied with the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.570
 result because it is exactly that 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.550
 I had in mind now to put the 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.240
 mascara or mascara let's see some 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.940

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.060
 the other et voila I put the first 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.729
 givhan ski with three balls and then the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.660

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.979
 I have to go to retouch the eyeliner in 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.320

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.380

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.220

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.630

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.410
 that I took from carmen in perfumery 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.760
 that he had 13 euros if I'm not wrong this 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.070
 which is a full size and only costs 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.440
 there is a full size and this one alone 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.420

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.780
 very comfortable anne glass 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.090

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.010
 I take it in my bag I like it 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.610

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.170
 lips 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.270

 turtleneck sweater a mock 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.480
 very simple this if not adherent 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.060
 mistake comes from this yes taken the year 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.290

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.800
 she is short for who cares I like myself 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.850

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.680
 high or maybe I can if it were 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.370
 the thinner it would be the more you don't know 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.530
 anyway pretty eh I put it on 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.360

 me when I fill a bag then 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.930

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.810
 and never changes it 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.860
