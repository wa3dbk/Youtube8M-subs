thank god for the mushrooms lands all

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.190 
thank god for the mushrooms lands all
that<00:02:02.130> stuff<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.659> coordinates

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that stuff so it's at this coordinates

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.340 
that stuff so it's at this coordinates
for<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.549> actually<00:02:06.479> when<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.110> go<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
for that and actually when you go to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.979 
for that and actually when you go to
this<00:02:07.530> mushroom<00:02:07.829> land<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.789> round<00:02:09.060> basically

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this mushroom land just round basically

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.490 
this mushroom land just round basically
underneath<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:11.430> will<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
underneath it there will be a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.440 
underneath it there will be a
a mine<00:02:13.160> shaft<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:14.030> uh<00:02:14.060> let's<00:02:14.600> dig<00:02:14.840> underneath

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
a mine shaft so uh let's dig underneath

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.940 
a mine shaft so uh let's dig underneath
right<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.230> coordinates<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.770> just

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
right here at the coordinates I just

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.300 
right here at the coordinates I just
shown<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.450> stick<00:02:20.900> down<00:02:21.110> not<00:02:21.860> far<00:02:22.100> down

shown you and stick down not far down
actually<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.240> will<00:02:23.450> find<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.260> mine

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
actually and you will find the mine

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.680 
actually and you will find the mine
shaft<00:02:24.860> there<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.670> got<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> lot<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.030> stuff<00:02:26.390> and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
shaft there it's got a lot of stuff and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.860 
shaft there it's got a lot of stuff and
you<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.320> definitely<00:02:27.830> explore<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:29.030> I'm<00:02:29.540> not

most of the stuff and important stuff I
will<00:02:33.470> he's<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> spider<00:02:34.700> spawner<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.900> that's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
will he's a spider spawner and that's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.350 
will he's a spider spawner and that's
what's<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> chest<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.130> i'll<00:02:38.090> show<00:02:38.300> you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the location now on the map the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.250 
the location now on the map the
coordinates<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.880> they're<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.990> map<00:02:42.110> if

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
coordinates it's a they're on the map if

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.570 
coordinates it's a they're on the map if
you<00:02:42.320> can<00:02:42.470> see<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.620> i'm<00:02:42.950> zoom<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.310> there<00:02:43.520> you

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
you can see that i'm zoom in there you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.449 
you can see that i'm zoom in there you
go<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.750> go<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.320> location<00:02:45.440> then<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.280> will

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
go so go to that location then you will

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.180 
go so go to that location then you will
find<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.320> next<00:02:48.320> I'm<00:02:48.410> going<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.680> showing<00:02:48.860> you

find it next I'm going to be showing you
a<00:02:50.260> zombie<00:02:51.260> spawner<00:02:51.500> there's<00:02:52.220> quite<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.489> few<00:02:52.550> of

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
a zombie spawner there's quite a few of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.400 
a zombie spawner there's quite a few of
them<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.060> this<00:02:53.150> map<00:02:53.360> will<00:02:53.630> show<00:02:53.810> your<00:02:53.989> mom<00:02:54.170> look

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
them on this map will show your mom look

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.020 
them on this map will show your mom look
at<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.530> show<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.830> probably<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.130> few<00:02:55.310> more<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:55.970> I

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
at a show is probably a few more so I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.310 
at a show is probably a few more so I
this<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.420> not<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> tree<00:02:56.959> everything

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
this one is not like a tree everything

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.600 
this one is not like a tree everything
just<00:02:57.470> one<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.010> everything<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:58.520> much

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
just one of everything pretty much

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.660 
just one of everything pretty much
lately<00:02:59.170> not<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> never<00:03:00.470> though<00:03:00.650> even<00:03:01.459> though

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
lately not the never though even though

lately not the never though even though
there's<00:03:01.850> quite<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> few<00:03:02.060> blaze<00:03:02.450> rods<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.930> never

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
there's quite a few blaze rods in never

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.320 
there's quite a few blaze rods in never
and<00:03:03.470> there<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.610> just<00:03:04.850> showed<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.030> the

and there I just showed you the
coordinates<00:03:05.570> for<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.170> zombie<00:03:06.320> spawner<00:03:06.470> you

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
coordinates for the zombie spawner you

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.090 
coordinates for the zombie spawner you
stick<00:03:07.220> down<00:03:07.400> from<00:03:07.580> there<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.630> is
