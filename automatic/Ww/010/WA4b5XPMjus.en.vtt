00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 the cosmobot this year was held at the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.040
 cosmocaixa barcelona 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
 we go with the first semifinal between 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.610
 schmidt brack that has not improved in the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.280
 last months against agache touched but 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.230
 Here you see a hick coastal reaching 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 smith this robot has not had big 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.830
 better either but at the algorithmic level 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.109
 he was very adapted to the track of fact 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 Andreu was programming all day in 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.010
 the cosmocaixa barcelona to adapt its 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.199
 track recognition to the circuit that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 emulated the great prize of catalonia in the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.160
 first chase he does touched but 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 came out all pill and hit black and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.800
 in the second round 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.090
 smith black changed tires and got 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 prolong the race for about 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 minutes but little by little gadget or copd 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 hero he came back the second semifinal was 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.920
 between jules that came from madrid and skipper 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.510
 the champion of Castilla-La Mancha 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.040
 Matron came from winning in Robolid in a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.050
 very small circuit with many curves 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 where everything played in his favor however 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 in the science museum of barcelona 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 the big straight benefited the robots 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.250
 they had track recognition here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.930
 we see as jules that premiered a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 acceleration and speed never seen in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.770
 competition ravaged bought killed with 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.770
 pattern tracing some straights 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.620
 that is, and must reach that push and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.940
 awesome backcountry on the 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 repetition the acceleration it picks up and the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.640
 final presaged a complicated duel 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020
 between the Catalan robot of tÃ rrega 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.520
 manufactured by Andrew Marshall 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.119
 although you see in the bottom and jules 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.680
 from madrid that comes out on top 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.900
 the level was very similar as we are going to 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.460
 see in the video that you have in front 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 none went back clearly 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.760
 the average speed of both robots were 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.160
 more or less than 3 meters second was 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.570
 circulating at 6 seconds per round one 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.190
 barbarity with respect to the 9 seconds 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.200
 that were reached early in the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.700
 tomorrow because they improved a lot during 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.100
 all day but not expert is the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.560
 tip speed of jules with 7.5 meters 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.140
 per second at the end of straight it seems 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.940
 I practically flew 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.420
 in fact, look at the end of the straight line 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.200
 jules that for some reason comes out 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.200
 my mother 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.439
 bad luck for the Madrid team that 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.319
 place the control hook with 10 that 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.459
 It was a very reliable and very proven robot 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.800
 a second round would have to see what was going 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.480
 to spend with jules million told us 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.620
 that he did not know why he had 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.319
 produced the problem in the first 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.879
 I tried so they were going a little 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.560
 blindly with the second one and in fact it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.989
 they came out again a penalty because jules 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.730
 is by far the fastest robot 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.200
 a most impressive tip speed 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.400
 that the circuit has never been seen 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.139
 in any case congratulations for 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.420
 gadget or cop ter or andrew marshall 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.700
 that make the category of sprinters 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.969
 in the cosmobot cosmobot thank you very much 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.969
 to all
