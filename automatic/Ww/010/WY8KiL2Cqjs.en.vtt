00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.940
 how the fan goes 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.950
 we are going to see it by October 3-2 of that superior year 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.280
 i the previous one we saw pure fishing 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.399
 for osorno 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:11.809
 clavicle 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.939
 the chain is not a joy that brings us problems 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.979
 but if you do it when determining whether your right and left thigh 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.769
 I realized that they have little problems that they have difficulty locating 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.019
 any decision as a right is left 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.140
 and that because we did not have to know hundreds of taxis that help later 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 for the points sigre chiquilla 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.950
 the fall is a long joy 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.210
 let's remember that wolves on one side have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.970
 a high that the predominance regarding its width of its thickness in space 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.730
 efe your bone the route cost 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.630
 which is going to join the scapula 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.470
 with plutonium co 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.190
 serve serves as a link 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.969
 from a point it grabs from the capu the entity aims to sagarra the sternum and the 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.240
 first 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.530
 it has the form of is exciting to 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.340
 has a way to quote a s 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 iruña from its extremes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.329
 if we look at it from above it is a superior drawing superior victim 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.000
 of a right clavicle 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.360
 this is earlier 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.470
 posterior internal caste and sternum 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.479
 He presented Arcadia in the capture community 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.080
 we see that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.810
 his inner half is conversation him before 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.150
 while its external half 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.950
 is concab forward 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.079
 this is what remains that way of 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.179
 second that italic oo seemed an exciting 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.210
 we describe in it a 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 internal limb 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.430
 a tip this round the inner one is higher the outer one is more ap the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.079
 alarm 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:40.950
 more sheet 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.150
 h tied 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.290
 an upper face that is moving 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.930
 and the lower face 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.180
 a previous edge 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.550
 and a border 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.270
 if the memory in front of the clavicle 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.410
 it is an ordeal appears which gives account this is internal externó 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.730
 lower superior a previous visit 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.880
 the fall is slightly with cava 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.980
 down 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.830
 then like I steal accounts since the right judge left 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.170
 the following way 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.599
 We always say a diver of them I want we have to give 1 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.109
 each of the three spatial parameters 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.909
 something for down river something for randy pratt punished for inside and 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.550
 to the outside 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.389
 it always has to be 1 facing the start 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.870
 then as switches and luque 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.559
 the highest extremity 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.879
 inward and the flattest out 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.279
 as always inferior let's see what 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.910
 it's more with cava 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.409
 asia down 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.090
 and also that your bottom face is going to turn out that I can know if 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.919
 contrary 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.529
 and as a previous post let's see what half 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.020
 the pair the inner half 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.069
 in this way that 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.599
 the convoy is forward let's wait for the three parameters to attend 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.539
 Caligula is right or left 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.569
 that we have inserted into the clavicle 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.010
 very good extremity 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.189
 external insert forward 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.540
 even within ten days ago inserted finds prisoner in are your 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.890
 shoulder muscles 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.619
 that is also going to be inserted into the spine of the scapula 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.399
 digitally 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.399
 comes from the adventure of the ogre high places 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.679
 in all the previous edge without being so pectoral muscle March 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.519
 i at the top is going to insert 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.849
 upwards 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.010
 He said that we had the upper part inc in the top 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.930
 sternocleidomastoid and inward very little the external believed and heard 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.559
 lescano believed and video is a muscle that belongs 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.879
 ap muscles inflate and videos 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.780
 and what gives a muscle more than its offer in the clavicle 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.139
 After his fall, 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.299
 turn around 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.270
 let's finish this is internal these external 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.270
 this is panther these later exactly 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.789
 we see that on the lower face we have a channel that is called lip cases 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.449
 country or insert a very tiny muscle 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.739
 that was searched stressed 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.739
 that goes from there to the first rib 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.239
 and finally cobbler look percent gives garda clavicle that much more 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.300
 reasons to say 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.719
 let's finish 12 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.559
 out with it acromion of the scapula 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.859
 in the joint that is a target other and because as well 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.930
 and in turn is an arturo day because his udders are articulate flat 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.900
 inward articulates with the caress calculate from the handlebar of the sternum 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.719
 with the first costal cartilage and with the first rib 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.979
 in the joint also mobile also of osteoarthritis 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.510
 but that as their substitution joints are concave convex in both directions 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.390
 is a reciprocal lace and this way look how it acts as a nexus 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.970
 between the upper limb and had pendent of the capsule 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.689
 and the thorax anchoring 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:48.849
 very well 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.360
 it's always difficult to know they had external if the trapeze turned today is 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.029
 uncertain before others which is inserted where 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.390
 and in the same way according to spinal scapula 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.490
 he evora his doses of the serious according to the whole and if the other way around 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.349
 then one way 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.349
 i got a lot of piola to remember us in the next 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.729
 so it is inserted 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.850
 the trapeze that comes from caste in the middle the trapeze 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.780
 and outside they are completely then in the spine of the scapula 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.509
 the upper edge 60 tetra price and the lower edge is inserted the 2010 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.779
 and in the clavicle in the anterior part the challenge is inserted in the part 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.139
 later release the 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.849
 trapiche 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.939
 inward then 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.860
 fish in the trapeze and out or peripherally insertion of the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.740
 double 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.110
 I think it's a very fiddle escape to agree which is inserted where 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.240
 trapeze 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.339
 and the Togolese 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.969
 one load there is nothing else to add 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.610
 just greet them 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.990
 successes and see you soon
