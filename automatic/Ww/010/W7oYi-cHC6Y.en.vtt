00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.840
 I just want to say that ranger is not 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.440
 rudi juliani we needed rudi 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.690
 juliani 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.340
 the first few days we needed 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.080
 good mayor in the first few days 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.720
 moreover on was necessary and you here 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.760
 talked about submission and let's talk 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.520
 about our beads and in the face of the elements it 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.350
 there was an incredible hurricane we couldn't all 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.260
 to master we did everything we could to 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.360
 I can't fix it myself 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.020
 submit to rudi juliani did 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.600
 at least one step without approval 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.059
 federal government and ranger 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.570
 ranger ranger did not leave the city he 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.479
 sat sitting in the city and begged for help a 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.190
 help didn't come raiders slowly quite 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.550
 without connection for three days because 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.560
 telephone connection he did not work lemon 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.520
 ties in new york too live it and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.810
 Jules did not know what to do in the hands of jim jam 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 keep calm keep calm you begin 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.100
 speak you start a little distant but 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.560
 it is not surprising it should not be 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.899
 surprisingly surprising that the rich 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.750
 white guy don't care about problems poor 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.720
 in black people they just don't give a damn about arno 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.670
 their life george I like to give them 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 I donâ€™t care about lucy or not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.560
 figurative list of people 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.569
 the tops will say so the owners of this 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.700
 countries are the true owners of this country 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.709
 forget these fools of voters to them 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.319
 the owner of this country doesn't care 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.110
 beggars black people precisely hymen i type 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.880
 wait a minute this is what Karl Marx is with me now 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.310
 say the owners of this side is 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.619
 voters you are mistaken very much 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.869
 countries this is a country voter those who 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.810
 choose a soul gone listen political 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.920
 choices this charade is fiction 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.280
 listen listen to me at least minutes and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.380
 maybe something learned choices and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.620
 political elections give ordinary 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.380
 Americans have the illusion that they have 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.430
 you really have no choice 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.270
 choice in this country 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.720
 since we have touched this topic with my friend 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.060
 he lives in new orleans he is black i 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 recorded word for word what he said 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.090
 I think it is important and he said after 11 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.280
 september i was american now i 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.769
 turned black again 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.750
 I think a stain on the reputation of George 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.080
 Bush Junior will be what he lost 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.269
 a whole generation of black people who 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.220
 maybe it felt like that 11 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.910
 October now I can not believe what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.640
 bought this shit i think we 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.560
 need to look at the black generation 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.230
 people who were born after that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.209
 Great Fucked Up 2005 Before 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.090
 they began to believe in america as they believed 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.739
 after September 11th, that is, I want to do business 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.769
 just clarify that is according to your 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.540
 George Bush does not care about 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.299
 african americans new orleans quit 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.850
 die them so are you different from the new mayor 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.890
 orleana who is also black 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.900
 which did not provide residents with food 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.380
 Power did not prepare buses for 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.180
 aviation george bush first president 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.030
 who nominated a black 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.150
 another state secretary 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.600
 black man appointed secretary and I 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.959
 I think that all the same more important division on 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 classes from clear meaning they have time 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.920
 more value only classes 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.320
 back to Karl Marx again I 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.959
 I think that the class position in America 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.410
 and since the Diet is connected there are no beggars 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.440
 white people in america 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.430
 consider it impossible to talk about class in 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.410
 America is weight accepting the fact that 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.770
 most black people are black people in 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.870
 this country is below the poverty line 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.200
 it's also impossible to say that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.960
 going on in new orleans without that 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.400
 some white conservatives 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.140
 focus on looting and 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.850
 crimes instead 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.930
 focus on that most 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.920
 poor hunted and afraid of each 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.560
 friend but when many many white 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.090
 Americans see what happens in 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.290
 new orleans where 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:41.220
 few black criminals are out 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.530
 control they think of like that behave 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.170
 black people multi me ask a question by 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.840
 about looting do you agree that 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.650
 there are two kinds of looting 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.950
 when people steal food from a store because 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.280
 that die of hunger and may die and 2 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.110
 when people steal a stereo tape recorder you 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.870
 agree that these are two different types 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.520
 looting then people who go out with 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.560
 TVs but no electricity to 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.830
 their cut itself you agree that there are two 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.890
 kind of looting oh well that is by 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.560
 your normal that the president issued 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.560
 ultimatum is absolute inadmissibility and 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.130
 so let your right 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.720
 screamer in liberal media 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.310
 declare this decree gives us the right 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.460
 shoot people without trial 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.310
 as if in the midst of the current crisis in 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.650
 which people are dying with our heads 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.240
 Sew on any black Tyrone 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.230
 who bears from an electronics store 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.230
 a couple of wet columns i think 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.600
 I think Tyrone and so was a couple 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.490
 my own wet columns 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.230
 add 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.790
 real looting in this country and 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.920
 This is when the rich steal from the poor sorry 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.640
 if you don't like truth and talk 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.590
 classes my friend and you can see that constantly 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.900
 rob rich 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:13.890
 led by a bandit us and the Nazis 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:16.440
 president and his government george 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.590
 george you're vkurse for in the course i think you 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.320
 you know this fascism fascism in this country 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.860
 so then the Nazis and thirst wait 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.810
 wait 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.180
 fascists in this country do not march 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.930
 they are dressed in sneakers and 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.640
 T-shirts from smiles all with smiles 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.400
 smiles germany lost 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.720
 second world war but fascism won 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.040
 believe me my friend 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.990
 actually fascism is when a corporation 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.790
 become government it's like 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.560
 what's happening with us and hit 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.810
 sorry forgive my question and george 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.730
 george do you think your looting 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.980
 is it normal or not without looking at and here 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.540
 hurricane normally break in somewhere 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.310
 the end of urine there is no problem with 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.830
 stealing frankly speaking no 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.570
 problems with theft and wait 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.600
 wait a second we're not wrong about this 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:09.090
 It reminds me of the situation with Andrzej deal 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.170
 not that jay was innocent we were all 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.320
 know that he killed his wife 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:16.200
 it's not that marauding is good we 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.000
 we all know that this is a bad thing in priority 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.550
 and the fact is white people 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.170
 upset about the fact that one 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.600
 a black criminal once broke 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:27.390
 law when there are millions of examples 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.740
 reverse also millions of people 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.740
 upset about a few 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.540
 renegades when the spotlight should 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.600
 become more critical crisis here 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.700
 business proportion that's what we mean 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.100
 speaking looting nobody protects 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.410
 marauders george he protects marauders 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.120
 I have nothing like this 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.389
 have 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.389
