00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
bangle I think that it looks really

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.500 
bangle I think that it looks really
pretty<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> mint<00:03:25.200> blue<00:03:25.440> color<00:03:25.830> and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
pretty with like a mint blue color and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.449 
pretty with like a mint blue color and
they<00:03:27.510> had<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.900> also<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.380> like<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> silver<00:03:28.920> with

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
they had this also in like a silver with

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.289 
they had this also in like a silver with
a<00:03:29.489> mint<00:03:29.820> stone<00:03:30.209> too<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.320> adjust<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
a mint stone too so you can adjust the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.400 
a mint stone too so you can adjust the
cuff<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.330> I'll<00:03:33.630> probably<00:03:33.750> wear<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.230> that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
cuff so I'll probably wear it like that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.039 
cuff so I'll probably wear it like that
with<00:03:34.769> my<00:03:34.980> other<00:03:35.220> cuffs<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.900> that's

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
with my other cuffs I think that's

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.590 
with my other cuffs I think that's

think this isn't 60 men's chain and it's

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.400 
think this isn't 60 men's chain and it's
supposed<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.669> be<00:06:06.790> kind<00:06:07.120> of<00:06:07.210> like<00:06:07.390> this<00:06:07.600> but

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
supposed to be kind of like this but

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.900 
supposed to be kind of like this but
just<00:06:08.830> because<00:06:08.950> of<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.340> weight<00:06:09.520> of<00:06:09.640> it<00:06:09.760> it

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
just because of the weight of it it

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.930 
just because of the weight of it it
always<00:06:10.120> falls<00:06:10.540> to<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:10.870> middle<00:06:11.200> so<00:06:12.010> yep<00:06:12.640> it's<00:06:12.820> a
