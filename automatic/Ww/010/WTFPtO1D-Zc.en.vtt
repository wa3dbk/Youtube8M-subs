00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.150 
now what I saw the advantage of being a
strong<00:04:58.670> guy<00:04:59.000> in<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.750> strengthening<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.830> power

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
strong guy in the strengthening of power

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.180 
strong guy in the strengthening of power
using<00:05:01.520> power<00:05:01.850> alone<00:05:02.570> with<00:05:02.780> technique<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.830> I

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
using power alone with technique and I

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.610 
using power alone with technique and I
think<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.700> last<00:05:04.850> fight<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.570> we<00:05:06.260> sure<00:05:06.440> had

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
think the last fight that we sure had

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.770 
think the last fight that we sure had
with<00:05:06.920> Alistair<00:05:07.670> it<00:05:07.970> showed<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.330> difference

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
with Alistair it showed the difference

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.720 
with Alistair it showed the difference
between<00:05:08.870> two<00:05:09.350> heavyweights<00:05:09.800> one<00:05:10.520> who<00:05:10.670> is

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
between two heavyweights one who is

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.570 
between two heavyweights one who is
really<00:05:10.910> strong

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
really strong

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.270 
really strong
and<00:05:12.699> I<00:05:13.060> knew<00:05:13.539> that<00:05:13.569> if<00:05:14.259> I<00:05:14.409> can<00:05:14.470> get<00:05:14.680> Fabrizio<00:05:15.220> to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
and I knew that if I can get Fabrizio to

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.520 
and I knew that if I can get Fabrizio to
start<00:05:15.639> training<00:05:16.120> weights<00:05:16.840> which<00:05:17.139> he's<00:05:17.319> never

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
start training weights which he's never

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.490 
start training weights which he's never
done<00:05:17.800> before<00:05:18.449> that<00:05:19.449> do<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:20.020> beautiful

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
done before that do you beautiful

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
fighter and

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.360 
fighter and
he's<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:21.940> very<00:05:22.360> determined<00:05:22.570> guy<00:05:23.050> he<00:05:24.040> trains

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
he's a very determined guy he trains

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.710 
he's a very determined guy he trains
very<00:05:24.580> hard<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:25.120> then<00:05:25.240> when<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.420> get<00:05:25.570> in<00:05:25.660> the

started<00:05:30.220> that's<00:05:30.700> why<00:05:30.850> I'm<00:05:30.910> saying<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.840> know

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
started that's why I'm saying you know

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.000 
started that's why I'm saying you know
this<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:33.640> an<00:05:33.960> escalation<00:05:34.960> good<00:05:35.620> direction

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
this is an escalation good direction

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.280 
this is an escalation good direction
yeah<00:05:36.430> there's<00:05:36.850> a<00:05:36.940> really<00:05:37.120> good<00:05:37.360> fight<00:05:37.600> it's<00:05:38.200> a

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.980 
yeah there's a really good fight it's a
very<00:05:38.590> tough<00:05:38.800> opponent<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:40.420> think

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
very tough opponent and I think

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.020 
very tough opponent and I think

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
everybody sees that it's a different

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.210 
everybody sees that it's a different
career<00:05:43.240> which<00:05:43.630> he<00:05:44.470> didn't<00:05:44.710> just<00:05:44.800> win<00:05:45.010> he

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220

gave<00:06:04.930> my<00:06:05.170> idea<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.560> said<00:06:05.830> listen<00:06:05.950> there's<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.430> guy

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
gave my idea I said listen there's a guy

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.150 
gave my idea I said listen there's a guy
who<00:06:07.300> it<00:06:07.420> doesn't<00:06:07.900> lift<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.140> lot<00:06:08.260> of<00:06:08.380> weights<00:06:08.530> but

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
who it doesn't lift a lot of weights but

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.010 
who it doesn't lift a lot of weights but
he<00:06:09.280> wants<00:06:09.550> to<00:06:09.580> start<00:06:09.850> training<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.780> think

if he was with your supplements that he

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.780 
if he was with your supplements that he
can<00:06:13.840> really<00:06:14.320> see<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.530> lot<00:06:14.860> of<00:06:14.890> improvement<00:06:15.610> very
