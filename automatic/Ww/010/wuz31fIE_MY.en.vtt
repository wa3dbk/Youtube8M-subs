smooth very easy to maneuver if you look

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.570 
smooth very easy to maneuver if you look
at<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.140> airplane<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.890> see<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.340> there's<00:01:12.520> a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
at the airplane you see that there's a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.020 
at the airplane you see that there's a
lot<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.970> glass<00:01:13.300> in<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:14.190> not<00:01:15.190> only<00:01:15.400> on<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.820> roof

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
lot of glass in it not only on the roof

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.580 
lot of glass in it not only on the roof
and<00:01:16.300> on<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.480> windshield<00:01:16.780> but<00:01:17.110> even<00:01:17.380> at<00:01:17.470> the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
and on the windshield but even at the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.550 
and on the windshield but even at the
back<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.550> wraps<00:01:18.880> around<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.440> can

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
back and it wraps around so that you can

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.960 
back and it wraps around so that you can
look<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.860> straight<00:01:21.070> over<00:01:21.190> your<00:01:21.430> shoulder<00:01:21.850> and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
down and this airplane stalls at 27

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.780 
down and this airplane stalls at 27
miles<00:01:25.060> an<00:01:25.270> hour<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.770> can<00:01:27.010> go<00:01:27.130> low<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.430> you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
miles an hour so you can go low and you

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.970 
miles an hour so you can go low and you
can<00:01:27.820> go<00:01:28.090> slow<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.470> what<00:01:29.650> we're<00:01:29.830> all

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980
