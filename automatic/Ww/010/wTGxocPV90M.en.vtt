00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.350
 h 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.110
 Well, as you saw in the title 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.930
 Mexican drug dealer in large photo 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.060
 5 online and we will see this interest that 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.710
 I already know that it is something that always 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.150
 been in big picture 5 because as already 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.360
 we know what it takes doing the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.460
 story was the youngest good young 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.590
 a man called madrazo which 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.390
 It was the one that had a lot to do with 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.400
 our characters in grain photo 5 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.530
 online then let's move here and go 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.059
 to see what I said ok I said 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.890
 when I was walking the game I realized 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.719
 that there was always a person here from 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.129
 fact there are several and with wolf enters the 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.320
 shirt then they saw the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.239
 shirt they bring and as they see it they are the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.059
 Mexican appearance by skin color and 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.059
 all this and apart from that the house says 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.160
 what a white fountain is doing 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.570
 then something like that says then there we 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.850
 we realize that doing as 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.590
 Mexican and look and I remember that 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.020
 some time ago in mexico said that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.119
 bring this kind of shirts it was like 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.440
 drug trafficker then here I am going to 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.240
 put this is more or less what 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.759
 doing in Mexico next will see a 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.470
 t-shirt like a shirt that was more or 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.540
 less than this I recommend them if 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.940
 they want to see those photos see the lows 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.470
 your circumstances because because at 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.330
 look for this shirt I found images 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.980
 very ugly and how a small audience is created 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.660
 Well, I do not want you to see any of this 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.730
 then there is one rather a t-shirt 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.640
 what the narco said that the narco is like 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.780
 the reductive of the drug trafficker who does not 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.610
 I know it's like saying do not be to a car 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.440
 well here it's not worth they say self-employed 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.420
 I think it's something like a reductive but 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.490
 as you see it has Mexican aspects 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.870
 apart from that he is taking care of the house as 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.430
 of what your boss is doing in which 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.710
 live inside then here we give ourselves 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.290
 realize that big car 25 takes many 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 what are the cultures and everything 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.220
 this here they try to give the greatest 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.320
 realism putting them to be 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.210
 Mexican drug traffickers and I also 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.880
 has realized something that the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.920
 Maikel does the cleaning is a Mexican 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.690
 then I say how can they take the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.130
 culture and everything and put it in a game 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.380
 there is also a mexican mariachi that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.060
 they say nothing those who use us de grades and 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.130
 all that and I say look at this game is very 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.739
 well done take cultures there is a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.420
 virgin as if it were Mexicans there 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.220
 for a bar and everything then is something 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 quite father not that they take quite 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.430
 in fact cultures is something 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.020
 so I like it big enough 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.180
 big cars 5 because 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.860
 and it's going to be done row is a game that does not 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.050
 takes into account the gap cultures of the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.240
 things because he 's so crazy then that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.710
 liked this view as they are the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.660
 just curious about one thing they 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.310
 I wanted to teach and as you see they all bring 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.140
 like the same type of shirt that brings 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.700
 like the raised collar this keep on 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.860
 like the neck lifted then like 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.450
 come here what we have are several things 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.130
 and apart from who is the one who lives here is 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.930
 very ostentatious for what I see because 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.460
 you have at home very big and look here 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.620
 they were what I told them look at the one 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.300
 here cut the plants curiously is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.760
 Mexican and one thing I do not try to 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.350
 offend, far less or nothing at all 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.300
 Mexicans because, as you see, I am 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.980
 mexican only I brought you this simple 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.570
 curiosity because the truth is something 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.220
 pretty weird how can you tell 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.410
 of the fashions that Mexicans have 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.450
 some things like that then it's something 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.950
 quite funny and apart as you see this 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.270
 you can see that he quite likes 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.400
 hair because here is like to 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.730
 have horses and how everyone sees them in their 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.080
 home have Mexican traits and the truth 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.020
 it's something that looks pretty father not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.850
 quite father then let's see a 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.490
 little bit more here how are you seeing has 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.320
 enough things the truth in your case not 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.270
 it's a very big house as you see it 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.890
 barn has new city things is 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.720
 something for what I like quite big 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.150
 because it takes into account the culture 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.650
 Mexican that influences the angels for 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.180
 put it in your game and look pretty 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.250
 Real also realize when 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.310
 they made the big picture 4 how they take in 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.709
 things account the new york 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.420
 fashions some things and how are the hot 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.459
 dogs that I had told them there are 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.320
 very much new york 'and gears auto 4 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.390
 They put a lot and here as they see it 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.100
 they take into account everything the aspects 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.360
 cultures religions take on everything in 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.160
 account apart from what I saw as a church 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.720
 that looks a lot like the ones here 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.220
 so that's what makes me pretty 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.620
 illusion is that it makes me pretty 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.080
 nice in big auto 5 then then 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.030
 it's simply an interest that I wanted them 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.950
 show a little curiosity but more 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.410
 that nothing is like rockstar realizes 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.630
 of cultures not only yours but that 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.730
 also from other countries as they ask for ideas 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.700
 that there are Mexicans who make such 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.530
 things the truth that yes it is a little 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.419
 we say racism but it's a bit 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.160
 that if they realize their culture and 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.230
 Well, it's not criticized, we're not going to 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.610
 that they put the one who cuts the step 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.010
 Mexican will give you is nothing 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.690
 critique is bad if I were there for the 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.700
 street killing is actually more criticizable 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.229
 our character that the one who cuts the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.400
 plants then you just liked it 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.800
 this interest 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.850
 as it is a reference of us take it 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.770
 something wrong or it's just a strawberry one 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.539
 reference bicha and if they are the simple 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.729
 reference has nothing to do 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.740
 then but you liked it was a 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.479
 reference therefore not so much a reference 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.250
 of two games but a reference to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.050
 a culture and because I do not think this 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.940
 it's pretty good of what big facto 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.800
 take into account cultures all that 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.509
 there's also here I've seen that out there 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.520
 there is an American who is saying that 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.039
 they created that country that would leave the 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.810
 illegal then here I see quite a few 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.580
 things that there are racist people in the 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.199
 game so to speak and there are people 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.419
 Mexican that's something I like 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.760
 pretty I think it gives a very 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.020
 accurate and very real to the game then he 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.940
 I hope you liked today's video 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.729
 one way the only thing I wanted to bring 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.830
 how they see it then that shirt that is 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.419
 I was very similar to this one, I hope 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.770
 have liked the video and not forget like 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.840
 favorites subscribe to the channel if not 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.260
 are subscribed without more than saying 9 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.260
 dismissal
