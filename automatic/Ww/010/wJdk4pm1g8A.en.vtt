00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.859
 and beauty people talk 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.109
 good today I 'm here in the brief 4 but it's not 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.820
 a live mtv I 'm bringing a 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.250
 video a little different from the ones already 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.939
 brought in the channel that is something that I 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.939
 I promised a long time already for you is is that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.920
 give some tips on how to improve on the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.120
 bs-4 how to play as well as like the game 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 Because at the beginning of the game I did not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.239
 I knew then play no shit calls 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.730
 I liked it but then I learned 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.230
 to play because I got to know 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.230
 the best multiplayer 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.660
 I really am one I liked the most 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.190
 Face I fell in love with the roof trf4 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.980
 So, without further ado, we'll start there. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.159
 and the tips 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 good first what you have to 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.030
 put on the head 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.979
 You do not go when you start the game. 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 You're not going to start killing everyone. 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 It does not help you then forget it's 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.189
 everything you've learned in multiplayer and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.729
 put a thing to your head learn to 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.689
 to move around in the game without moving 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.329
 this game and you're nothing you do not 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.369
 You still have to go out there in the face. 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.180
 trying to kill everyone the same make in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.530
 start does not work you always have 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.570
 to learn to move around 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 if you think you know how to move 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.829
 they also did not have enough of this 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.460
 So we always have to be 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.549
 learning these new things as well 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.159
 What is your skill and if is this 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.450
 always side by side layout move 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.000
 its yours that i in bs-4 i think not 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.110
 no you do not need to focus as much as on 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.490
 movement 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.810
 but it's good of course that 's good you have to 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.990
 have a skill 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.620
 but I think the first thing you need 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.030
 in this game is really movement is 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.300
 That's really good 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.310
 is also not disputing the faces 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.460
 I did not realize what I think in 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:30.370
 console is the beque on xbox select on ps3 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.130
 so it 's because it has a touch it has 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.200
 advantages of exporting because in addition to 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.310
 You've only seen the car of yours. 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.250
 team 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.170
 so they will also help you with the package 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 a doctor is also important in this game 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.760
 You're always throwing this way on the floor. 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.580
 I can also use two packets 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.330
 but if I do not know if this is advantage 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.340
 I what I'm using these days 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.670
 but I do not think it's much advantage 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.070
 You use this so I'll take my 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.770
 Any questions after I told you? 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.350
 the glitz site is also good you use 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.570
 It's very good, it's network beach for who 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.910
 some do not know anything for you 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.620
 to protect you from knowing if it's 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.890
 that it is more difficult than 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:21.670
 hit the F3DM map of the containers not 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.540
 remember the name now had a blindness 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.980
 said long time already this is staying on top 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.510
 of containers sometimes because you handle 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.989
 the guys up while they're coming from 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.680
 down and that's really good 94 help 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.470
 much but who saves the maps you 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.480
 can always be on top and the cars 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.489
 underneath it then it is not always that 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.610
 You'll get it but it helps. 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.060
 also granada you have three grenades 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:57.430
 when nothing mini then always remains 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.950
 I look at the Pope in an eye on gameplay and 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.470
 also a map is very good you always 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.049
 have to keep an eye on him because he will 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.850
 help I'll give you a lot of 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.620
 where such 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.050
 - where is your team if you're near 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.500
 You're far, so it's an eye for support. 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.820
 in the game's multiplayer apologize is 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.920
 and also his weapon, I think 24 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.230
 that the benfica did this did not have much 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.830
 importance but in this b is very 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.410
 important you get used to with your gun 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.830
 so take a gun and it will only help 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.080
 she only plays with her for you 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.260
 learn to play with her if it's okay to pick up 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.100
 uses the same it is an example of this I 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.800
 I give so that there're 971 I think if the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.220
 her name I played more with them than 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.350
 to them and 23 and even after I opened 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.660
 in itself that many consider as a 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.540
 best weapon the game has the staff was 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.160
 competitive playing with her I realized 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.010
 the difference that I think this is the 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.500
 The most striking difference is that it is 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.780
 that the retreat the retreat is more down 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.280
 you can handle better but 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.710
 ending up inside her is very good in my 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.570
 opinion and then to do so 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.290
 and comparing the best weapons of the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.740
 game to give you tips on them 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.780
 but this is a little more forward one 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.040
 A little but I can talk to you 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.230
 The choice thus makes use of attachments or 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.220
 You'll use it on your weapons. 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.840
 I do not think it makes much difference 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.440
 after you take the mothers so do not 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.570
 It will make a lot of difference so it goes 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.680
 leave better or worse, God, you alone 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:48.960
 You have to get used to it even if you go. 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:52.110
 there does not matter and also the modules that the 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.390
 more games and it's good for you to learn this 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.270
 which greatly increases your skill is that of 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.520
 I will also mine because it is not that 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.830
 thing of vehicle such a strong emotion 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.690
 very big then 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.450
 one is a little tight 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:10.020
 maps you can learn more 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:13.290
 game playing these ways I do not 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.770
 there are many Serbs still with these modes 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.770
 but it's good some you think it's not easy 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.740
 but advises you will play and now 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.720
 I get a file boom this is book 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.170
 b car goes doing up with the banks 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.020
 but nothing that disrupts the gameplay the hip 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.520
 file in this game is good very good even 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.120
 no pc 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.640
 It's kind of close up so close. 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.280
 try to aim already has a riff in the face 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.740
 using any laser that you 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.860
 use and is already good - indicated that they 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.960
 neighbor and it 's fine but I advise 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.720
 This green that is English I think acts 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.420
 laser that makes you take out a 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.490
 A little bit faster also has some 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.960
 attachments you always have to pay 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.690
 attention to what you will say in your 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.990
 gun because sometimes you want some 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.520
 thing is not good but it either ends up 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.650
 getting used to 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.720
 or if you have something that you think is 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.720
 Good, but you do not get used to it 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.090
 so this is nice if you liked the 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.160
 tips only I advise 5min worked 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.380
 I hope they work with you if you 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.600
 liked the video to leave your like your 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.240
 Favorite I'll stay around later. 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:28.820
 I'll make two more tips for you. 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.820
 beauty then this is it with the low
