hey guys welcome to a quick blend of
minecraft<00:00:05.520> tutorial<00:00:06.029> today<00:00:06.750> I'm<00:00:06.960> gonna<00:00:07.109> go

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
minecraft tutorial today I'm gonna go

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.169 
minecraft tutorial today I'm gonna go
over<00:00:07.350> how<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.649> append<00:00:08.099> objects<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.790> also<00:00:08.910> how

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
over how to append objects and also how

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:09.950 
over how to append objects and also how
to<00:00:09.240> use<00:00:09.510> them

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
to use them

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.410 
to use them
cloth<00:00:10.559> simulations<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.250> cloth<00:00:11.429> physics<00:00:11.849> -<00:00:12.059> in

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
cloth simulations and cloth physics - in

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.749 
cloth simulations and cloth physics - in
all<00:00:12.870> minecraft<00:00:13.500> animations<00:00:14.009> basically<00:00:14.519> so

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
all minecraft animations basically so

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.960 
all minecraft animations basically so
I'll<00:00:15.240> cover<00:00:15.570> adding<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> crafting<00:00:17.010> table<00:00:17.279> using

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I'll cover adding a crafting table using

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.849 
I'll cover adding a crafting table using
appending<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.660> then<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.470> ahead<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
appending and then going ahead and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
appending and then going ahead and
making<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.369> quick<00:00:20.640> cloth<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> go<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.510> top<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
making a quick cloth to go on top of it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.769 
making a quick cloth to go on top of it
and<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.640> making<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> simulation<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.539> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and just making the simulation for it I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
and just making the simulation for it I
might<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:25.920> quickly<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> make<00:00:26.760> flags

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
might go over quickly how to make flags

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.730 
might go over quickly how to make flags
cuz<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.510> pretty<00:00:27.869> straightforward<00:00:28.349> as

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
cuz that's pretty straightforward as

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.229 
cuz that's pretty straightforward as
well<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.279> yeah<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.810> open<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.050> blender<00:00:31.439> first

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
well so yeah if I open up blender first

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.470 
well so yeah if I open up blender first
and<00:00:33.290> just<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.530> default<00:00:34.950> scene<00:00:35.360> turn<00:00:36.360> on

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and just with the default scene turn on

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.440 
and just with the default scene turn on
screencast<00:00:37.020> keys<00:00:37.460> hit<00:00:38.460> X<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.879> delete<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> cube

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
screencast keys hit X to delete the cube

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.180 
screencast keys hit X to delete the cube
and<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> append<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.070> what

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and to append if you don't know what

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
and to append if you don't know what
this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.820> linking<00:00:42.239> objects

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this is it's just linking objects

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.529 
this is it's just linking objects
between<00:00:43.129> different<00:00:44.129> scenes<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.390> know

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
between different scenes or you know

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
between different scenes or you know
just<00:00:45.570> putting<00:00:46.079> something<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.489> blender

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
just putting something from one blender

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
just putting something from one blender
file<00:00:48.030> into<00:00:48.360> another<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.020> making<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.039> copy<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
file into another and making a copy of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
file into another and making a copy of
it<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.730> won't<00:00:50.879> affect<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.270> original<00:00:51.739> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it so it won't affect the original so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
it so it won't affect the original so
your<00:00:52.920> file<00:00:53.129> append<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> shortcut<00:00:54.690> shift

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
your file append or the shortcut shift

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.549 
your file append or the shortcut shift
f1<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.910> locate<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.140> file<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
f1 and then just locate the file you

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.080 
f1 and then just locate the file you
want<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> append<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.550> append<00:00:59.910> my

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
want to append so I'm gonna append my

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.389 
want to append so I'm gonna append my

basically all you need to do is select

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
basically all you need to do is select
the<00:01:09.600> object<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.950> also

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the object one here but you can also

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
the object one here but you can also
append<00:01:11.400> different<00:01:11.700> things<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.479> more

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
append different things like more

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.340 
append different things like more
precise<00:01:13.049> things<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.560> mash<00:01:14.280> lab<00:01:15.180> image<00:01:15.540> what

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
precise things like mash lab image what

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
precise things like mash lab image what
if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.009> object<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.729> basically<00:01:18.150> all

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
if you want but object is basically all

if you want but object is basically all
of<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:19.049> except<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.880> material<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
of them I think except like material and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
of them I think except like material and
I<00:01:21.659> believe<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.020> append<00:01:22.890> no<00:01:23.549> groups<00:01:23.850> as

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I believe you can append no groups as

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
I believe you can append no groups as
well<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.570> how<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.200> did<00:01:25.650> my

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
well which was actually how I did my

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
well which was actually how I did my
compositing<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> ravine<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:28.020> same

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
compositing for a ravine it was the same

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380 
compositing for a ravine it was the same
all<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.470> through<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.729> yeah<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> used

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
all the way through and so yeah I used

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.810 
all the way through and so yeah I used
that<00:01:30.540> technique<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> objects

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that technique but if you go to objects

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
that technique but if you go to objects
and<00:01:32.970> choose<00:01:33.420> whatever<00:01:33.659> file<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.200> want<00:01:34.439> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and choose whatever file you want it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.200 
and choose whatever file you want it's
all<00:01:34.740> names<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> choose

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
all names I'm just going to choose

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
all names I'm just going to choose
crafting<00:01:36.689> table<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.340> right<00:01:38.340> click<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.820> select

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
crafting table and right click to select

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
crafting table and right click to select
it<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.810> well<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:41.009> thing<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it to make it well the only thing you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.370 
it to make it well the only thing you
select<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.509> got<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> yellow<00:01:42.960> outline<00:01:43.170> I

no sorry selection to cursor and I'll
just<00:01:50.340> put<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> center<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
just put it in the center and if you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.980 
just put it in the center and if you
render<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.770> quickly<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:54.659> should<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
render this quickly it should have a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
render this quickly it should have a
texture<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> packed<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
texture because I packed all of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.950 
texture because I packed all of the
textures<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> yeah

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
textures and yeah

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.590 
textures and yeah
so<00:01:59.960> all<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.259> have<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.439> do<00:02:00.740> -<00:02:01.250> well<00:02:02.149> do<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.329> cloth

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
so all you have to do - well do a cloth

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.679 
so all you have to do - well do a cloth
simulation<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:03.549> other<00:02:04.549> planes<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.329> go<00:02:05.450> shift

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
simulation is other planes to go shift

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.029 
simulation is other planes to go shift
eight<00:02:05.990> add<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:07.070> plane<00:02:07.850> hit<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.679> use<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.830> blue

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
eight add a plane hit and use this blue

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.820 
eight add a plane hit and use this blue
arrow<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.429> drag<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.789> up<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.420> then<00:02:12.349> just<00:02:12.650> go

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
arrow to drag it up and then just go

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.430 
arrow to drag it up and then just go
into<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.130> top<00:02:13.310> view<00:02:13.610> hit<00:02:14.209> tab<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.810> subdivide

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
into the top view hit tab and subdivide

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.199 
into the top view hit tab and subdivide
it<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.519> has<00:02:16.790> 16<00:02:17.390> faces<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.670> well<00:02:19.670> 16<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.150> 16

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
it so it has 16 faces on well 16 by 16

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.270 
it so it has 16 faces on well 16 by 16
basically<00:02:21.050> which<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.290> how<00:02:21.380> many<00:02:21.530> pixels<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.160> in

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
basically which is how many pixels is in

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.479 
basically which is how many pixels is in
a<00:02:22.340> Minecraft<00:02:22.819> block<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.630> think<00:02:24.430> by<00:02:25.430> default

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
a Minecraft block I think by default

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.390 
a Minecraft block I think by default
anyway<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.209> once<00:02:27.140> you've<00:02:27.260> done<00:02:27.410> that<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:28.190> tap

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
anyway so once you've done that just tap

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.809 
anyway so once you've done that just tap
out<00:02:28.489> with<00:02:28.550> edit<00:02:28.880> mode<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.519> there's<00:02:31.519> nothing

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
out with edit mode and there's nothing

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.970 
out with edit mode and there's nothing
really<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.660> can<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.680> get<00:02:33.830> rid<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
really to it you can just get rid of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.800 
really to it you can just get rid of
this<00:02:34.130> quickly<00:02:34.370> make<00:02:35.209> sure<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.480> select<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
this quickly make sure you select the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.729 
this quickly make sure you select the
plane<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.410> go<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.010> cloth<00:02:38.200> right<00:02:39.200> click<00:02:39.440> sex

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
plane and go to cloth right click sex

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.699 
plane and go to cloth right click sex
the<00:02:40.310> objects<00:02:41.239> it's<00:02:41.750> interacting<00:02:42.230> with<00:02:42.349> sorry

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
the objects it's interacting with sorry

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.670 
the objects it's interacting with sorry
and<00:02:42.970> make<00:02:43.970> sure<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.269> on<00:02:44.330> collision<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.019> you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and make sure it's on collision and you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.140 
and make sure it's on collision and you
don't<00:02:45.950> need<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.160> tweak<00:02:46.400> any<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.760> settings

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
don't need to tweak any of the settings

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.520 
don't need to tweak any of the settings
really<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.569> hit<00:02:47.780> all<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.140> play

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
really you just hit all a to play

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.430 
really you just hit all a to play
through<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.860> timeline<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:50.569> all<00:02:50.720> reacts

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
through the timeline and it all reacts

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.660 
through the timeline and it all reacts
with<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.370> object<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.180> real<00:02:53.329> time<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:55.519> can

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
with the object in real time and you can

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.360 
with the object in real time and you can
also<00:02:55.819> go<00:02:56.239> ahead<00:02:56.329> and<00:02:56.480> move<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:57.250> whichever<00:02:58.250> way

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
also go ahead and move it whichever way

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130 
also go ahead and move it whichever way
you<00:02:58.459> want<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.819> it'll<00:02:59.000> still<00:02:59.239> reacts<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.870> that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
you want and it'll still reacts in that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.039 
you want and it'll still reacts in that
way<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:01.579> that's<00:03:01.790> all<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.060> well<00:03:02.600> that's<00:03:02.780> really

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
way and that's all I well that's really

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.930 
way and that's all I well that's really
how<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.440> did<00:03:03.739> my<00:03:03.859> crafting<00:03:04.250> table<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.640> works<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
how I did my crafting table it works the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.180 
how I did my crafting table it works the
same<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.150> capes<00:03:05.540> except<00:03:06.410> capes<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:06.920> need<00:03:07.069> to

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
same for capes except capes you need to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.039 
same for capes except capes you need to
do<00:03:07.310> collision<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.150> pinning<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.660> stuff<00:03:08.870> which

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
do collision and pinning and stuff which

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.860 
do collision and pinning and stuff which
I'll<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.319> into<00:03:09.380> when<00:03:09.799> I'm<00:03:09.890> making<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.220> flag

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
I'll get into when I'm making the flag

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.140 
I'll get into when I'm making the flag
but<00:03:11.870> yeah<00:03:11.989> that's<00:03:12.109> it<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.940> basic<00:03:13.940> cloth

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
but yeah that's it for basic cloth

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.729 
but yeah that's it for basic cloth
simulation<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.959> add<00:03:15.079> a<00:03:15.319> subsurf

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
simulation you can add a subsurf

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.099 
simulation you can add a subsurf
modifier<00:03:15.769> if<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.489> want<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.600> smoothen<00:03:18.019> it

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
modifier if you want just to smoothen it

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.229 
modifier if you want just to smoothen it
out<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:20.480> can<00:03:20.660> smooth<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.049> here<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:23.090> yeah

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
out you can smooth it here and yeah

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:23.800 
out you can smooth it here and yeah
that's<00:03:23.450> it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
that's it

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.949 
that's it
and<00:03:23.920> finally<00:03:24.920> if<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.280> go<00:03:25.459> ahead<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.970> make<00:03:26.090> quick

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
and finally if I go ahead and make quick

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.870 
and finally if I go ahead and make quick
flag<00:03:27.350> as<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.799> said<00:03:28.040> I'm<00:03:28.130> not<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.459> text<00:03:28.670> or

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
flag as I said I'm not going to text or

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
flag as I said I'm not going to text or
anything<00:03:29.150> here<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:32.120> make<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.569> pole

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
anything here but just make the pole

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.099 
anything here but just make the pole
sorry<00:03:33.230> real<00:03:33.500> quick<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:34.790> click<00:03:35.060> cube<00:03:35.870> here

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
sorry real quick just click cube here

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.190 
sorry real quick just click cube here
and<00:03:36.230> go<00:03:36.380> shift<00:03:36.620> 8<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.100> then<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.900> make<00:03:38.900> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and go shift 8 and then just make the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.170 
and go shift 8 and then just make the
shape<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:41.470> pole<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.889> flag<00:03:43.130> really<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:43.670> just

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
shape of a pole of a flag really so just

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.099 
shape of a pole of a flag really so just
scale<00:03:44.389> it<00:03:44.420> on<00:03:44.660> different<00:03:44.840> axis<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.560> this

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
scale it on different axis like this

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.789 
scale it on different axis like this
drag<00:03:48.109> it<00:03:48.260> up<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:49.090> think<00:03:50.090> I'll<00:03:50.239> shift<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.690> add<00:03:51.470> a

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
drag it up I think I'll shift a add a

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.680 
drag it up I think I'll shift a add a
plane<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.639> this<00:03:52.700> will<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.090> flag<00:03:53.329> itself

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
plane and this will be the flag itself

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.110 
plane and this will be the flag itself
and<00:03:54.170> rotate<00:03:54.859> it<00:03:55.010> on<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.190> x-axis<00:03:55.579> type<00:03:56.209> 90<00:03:56.660> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
and rotate it on the x-axis type 90 and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.759 
and rotate it on the x-axis type 90 and
just<00:03:59.120> scale<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.720> so<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.079> looks<00:04:00.230> like<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.440> flag

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
just scale it so it looks like a flag

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.300 
just scale it so it looks like a flag
really<00:04:01.130> sort<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.519> z-axis<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:03.310> position

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
really sort and the z-axis and position

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.440 
really sort and the z-axis and position
it

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
it

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.600 
it
like<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.770> then<00:04:07.099> once<00:04:07.250> you've<00:04:07.400> done<00:04:07.550> that

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
like so and then once you've done that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.479 
like so and then once you've done that
go<00:04:08.000> into<00:04:08.599> local<00:04:09.319> view<00:04:09.530> by<00:04:09.920> hitting<00:04:09.950> this

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
go into local view by hitting this

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.270 
go into local view by hitting this
backslash<00:04:10.910> next<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.569> shift<00:04:11.780> key<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.410> just

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
backslash next to the shift key and just

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.860 
backslash next to the shift key and just
subdivided<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> few<00:04:14.150> times<00:04:14.390> doesn't<00:04:14.750> actually

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
subdivided a few times doesn't actually

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.729 
subdivided a few times doesn't actually
matter<00:04:15.230> how<00:04:15.470> many<00:04:15.650> times<00:04:16.900> for<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.959> flag<00:04:18.380> really

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
matter how many times for a flag really

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.129 
matter how many times for a flag really
because<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.280> not<00:04:19.519> a<00:04:19.790> Minecraft<00:04:20.540> object<00:04:21.019> so

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
because it's not a Minecraft object so

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.060 
because it's not a Minecraft object so
it<00:04:21.200> doesn't<00:04:21.410> have<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.530> stick<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:21.980> the

it doesn't have to stick to the

here<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.530> go<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.590> physics<00:04:58.160> go<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.090> cloth<00:04:59.510> and

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
here and go to physics go to cloth and

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.860 
here and go to physics go to cloth and
choose<00:05:01.220> pinning<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:01.850> then<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.240> vertex<00:05:02.600> group

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
choose pinning and then the vertex group

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.500 
choose pinning and then the vertex group
here<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.460> can<00:05:04.610> click<00:05:04.760> all<00:05:04.970> eight<00:05:05.210> it

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
here and you can click all eight it

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.500 
here and you can click all eight it
should<00:05:06.460> do<00:05:07.460> something<00:05:08.000> there<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:08.510> go

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
should do something there you go

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.760 
should do something there you go
see<00:05:11.510> ya<00:05:11.660> but<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.020> only<00:05:12.140> thing<00:05:12.350> you<00:05:12.440> need<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.590> do

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
see ya but the only thing you need to do

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.290 
see ya but the only thing you need to do
now<00:05:12.919> is<00:05:13.130> make<00:05:13.340> this<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.520> collision<00:05:14.000> otherwise

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
now is make this a collision otherwise

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.400 
now is make this a collision otherwise
it's<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:14.750> going<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:14.960> go<00:05:15.080> straight<00:05:15.350> through

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
it's just going to go straight through

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.800 
it's just going to go straight through
it<00:05:15.770> as<00:05:16.550> you<00:05:16.700> can<00:05:16.850> see<00:05:17.060> there<00:05:17.240> which<00:05:17.419> doesn't

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
it as you can see there which doesn't

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.860 
it as you can see there which doesn't
look<00:05:17.870> very<00:05:18.140> realistic<00:05:18.880> so<00:05:19.880> we<00:05:20.479> need<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.750> do

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
look very realistic so we need to do

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.480 
look very realistic so we need to do
select<00:05:21.169> collision<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.979> that's<00:05:22.130> all<00:05:22.310> there<00:05:22.430> is

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
select collision and that's all there is

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.170 
select collision and that's all there is
to<00:05:22.729> it<00:05:23.410> so<00:05:24.410> now<00:05:24.560> we'll<00:05:24.770> react<00:05:25.130> like<00:05:25.910> a

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
to it so now we'll react like a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.810 
to it so now we'll react like a
real-life<00:05:26.750> flag<00:05:27.200> hopefully<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:28.340> then<00:05:28.520> again

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
real-life flag hopefully and then again

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.600 
real-life flag hopefully and then again
you<00:05:28.940> can<00:05:29.060> go<00:05:29.210> ahead<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.510> add<00:05:29.600> a<00:05:29.630> sub<00:05:29.870> surf<00:05:30.610> like

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
you can go ahead and add a sub surf like

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.310 
you can go ahead and add a sub surf like
that<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.940> might<00:05:32.090> like<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.360> bit<00:05:32.630> in<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:32.810> viewport

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
that it might like a bit in the viewport

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.219 
that it might like a bit in the viewport
but<00:05:34.000> when<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:35.090> render<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.390> out<00:05:35.570> if<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:35.990> turn

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
but when you render it out if you turn

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.680 
but when you render it out if you turn
this<00:05:36.470> render<00:05:37.070> up<00:05:37.220> here<00:05:37.430> it<00:05:37.970> should<00:05:38.120> look<00:05:38.240> quite

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
this render up here it should look quite

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.590 
this render up here it should look quite
nice<00:05:38.930> like<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.229> flag<00:05:40.120> see<00:05:41.120> how<00:05:41.210> that's<00:05:41.390> it

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
nice like a flag see how that's it

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.420 
nice like a flag see how that's it
