00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.420
 nice to all the kids and welcome to the 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.120
 my first video and today we are here with a 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.710
 ghost goal 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.059
 other than the goal by muntari alla juve 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.940
 that was a phantom goal 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.410
 this is worse, perhaps not seen from here 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.740
 well so pavia replay me 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.779
 however I give you my impressions 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.240
 this is really a phantom goal 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.020
 anyone who sees it says that a goal 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.189
 ghost because you see the ball coming in 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.800
 clearly on the net 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.329
 and now this incredible I believe 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 this is the best phantom goal that 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.920
 ever existed 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.100
 because the ball enters the net you see 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.630
 that up a lot of air on the line of 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 door and is passed by the ball of 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.879
 very yet the referee does not validate the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 goals 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.520
 because for him there is not and now soon 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:03.320
 we will see that you look here reason 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.939
 the referee and the guards and why but 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.889
 there is little to think about here is a goal 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.380
 phantom, however, must reason 

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:12.289
 because a difficult choice 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.599
 here there will certainly be a nice one 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.999
 loot of money from the team that doesn't 

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.319
 took the goal because it was not given 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.840
 by the 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.310
 I don't know anything if there's money 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.259
 below or not 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.630
 however I only know one thing this is a 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.679
 almost a hundred percent ghost goal 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.889
 even more 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.719
 look carefully look at the 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:38.509
 player hits the ball goes head 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.880
 first on the pole then return inside that yes 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.039
 sees entry inside without new on 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.090
 pole the goalkeeper sees the ball and the para 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.130
 but the goalkeeper 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.749
 I think that in my opinion he thought that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.619
 ball was born first on a pole and then a 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:54.709
 else or patience I have not seen 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.609
 no apparatus and its requirement is enough 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.719
 it is not even this from which one sees well 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.340
 thanks anyway for viewing 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.389
 this video will not see you at the next one 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.389
 video and bye bye
