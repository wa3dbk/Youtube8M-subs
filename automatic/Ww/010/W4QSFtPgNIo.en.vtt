00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and this is the best part here the HDMI

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
and this is the best part here the HDMI
connection<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> latest

televisions<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> idea<00:01:07.619> behind<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
televisions and so the idea behind it is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
televisions and so the idea behind it is
you<00:01:08.400> basically<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.210> USB<00:01:09.479> Drive<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you basically take your USB Drive and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
you basically take your USB Drive and
it's<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.290> two<00:01:10.470> USB<00:01:10.680> ports<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.210> plug

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it's got two USB ports that you can plug

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.760 
it's got two USB ports that you can plug
into<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.049> gonna<00:01:13.140> plug<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
into so I'm gonna plug this into the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.580 
into so I'm gonna plug this into the
back<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.750> basically<00:01:15.960> start

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
back here and this will basically start

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
back here and this will basically start
browsing<00:01:16.920> through<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.970> hard<00:01:18.360> drive<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.930> then

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
browsing through my hard drive and then

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
browsing through my hard drive and then
sort<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.159> content<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.939> me<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.240> a
