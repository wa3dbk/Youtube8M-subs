00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
that has not necessarily been revealed

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.440 
that has not necessarily been revealed
yet<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.610> not<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.909> much<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.239> haven't

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
yet and it's not so much that I haven't

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.240 
yet and it's not so much that I haven't
revealed<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.170> yet<00:02:55.409> it's<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.769> they<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
revealed it yet it's just they do it

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.970 
revealed it yet it's just they do it
just<00:02:56.430> falls<00:02:56.640> into<00:02:56.819> different<00:02:57.209> categories

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
just falls into different categories

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.160 
just falls into different categories
and<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.489> think<00:02:59.760> pattern<00:03:00.299> is<00:03:00.629> one<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.019> them

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
and I think pattern is one of them

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.250 
and I think pattern is one of them

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
art and maybe that's why the stuff

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.000 
art and maybe that's why the stuff
becomes<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:51.629> precious<00:03:52.169> because<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.440> am<00:03:52.560> dealing
