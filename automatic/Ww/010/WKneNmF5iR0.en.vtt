media but i do i laid down a good
blasting<00:00:34.750> on<00:00:34.900> it<00:00:35.050> don't<00:00:35.589> even<00:00:35.680> worry<00:00:35.860> about

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
blasting on it don't even worry about

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.920 
blasting on it don't even worry about
sanding<00:00:36.489> after<00:00:36.729> eat<00:00:36.970> treat<00:00:37.299> because<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
media blast name is going to remove all

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.399 
media blast name is going to remove all
the<00:00:39.430> scale<00:00:39.670> that<00:00:39.790> comes<00:00:40.000> on<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.479> that's<00:00:41.199> all

surface stuff anyways but once the media
blasting<00:00:44.199> is<00:00:44.260> done<00:00:44.440> it's<00:00:44.680> going<00:00:44.769> to<00:00:44.860> have<00:00:45.040> a

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
blasting is done it's going to have a

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.950 
blasting is done it's going to have a
nice<00:00:45.370> gray<00:00:45.760> finish<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.420> then<00:00:46.540> i'll<00:00:46.659> go<00:00:46.690> from

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
nice gray finish and then i'll go from

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.479 
nice gray finish and then i'll go from
there<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.440> I'll<00:00:47.650> polish<00:00:47.830> it<00:00:48.070> down<00:00:48.250> through

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
there and I'll polish it down through

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.850 
there and I'll polish it down through
the<00:00:48.610> through<00:00:49.449> my<00:00:49.540> series<00:00:49.930> of<00:00:49.960> compounds<00:00:50.680> on<00:00:50.769> my

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
the through my series of compounds on my

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.799 
the through my series of compounds on my
polishing<00:00:51.280> wheels<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.699> what<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.570> end<00:00:52.600> up

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
polishing wheels and what you end up

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.259 
polishing wheels and what you end up
with<00:00:52.869> is<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.379> pretty<00:00:54.280> smooth<00:00:54.610> looking<00:00:55.000> finish

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
with is a pretty smooth looking finish

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.359 
with is a pretty smooth looking finish
like<00:00:56.260> what<00:00:56.440> we<00:00:56.530> have<00:00:56.710> right<00:00:56.920> here<00:00:56.979> on<00:00:57.159> this

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:57.369 
like what we have right here on this

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.329 
like what we have right here on this
blade<00:00:57.699> it's<00:00:58.540> just<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.780> nice<00:00:58.960> durable<00:00:59.860> gray

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
blade it's just a nice durable gray

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.399 
blade it's just a nice durable gray
finish<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.420> it's<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.659> lot<00:01:01.780> harder<00:01:01.900> to<00:01:02.110> scratch

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
finish and it's a lot harder to scratch

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.009 
finish and it's a lot harder to scratch
than<00:01:02.650> your<00:01:02.769> typical<00:01:02.860> satin<00:01:03.430> finish<00:01:03.729> or

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
than your typical satin finish or

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.230 
than your typical satin finish or
especially<00:01:05.019> your<00:01:05.500> mirror<00:01:05.710> finish<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.090> we're

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
especially your mirror finish so we're

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.060 
especially your mirror finish so we're
going<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.600> load<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.780> up<00:01:07.960> into<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.350> media

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
going to just load it up into the media

00:01:09.070 --> 00:02:22.980 
going to just load it up into the media
blaster<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:09.700> we'll<00:01:09.910> see<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.060> there

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.900 

so<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.740> can<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:24.010> by<00:02:24.160> looking<00:02:24.190> at<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.790> a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
so as you can see by looking at it a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.580 
so as you can see by looking at it a
very<00:02:25.330> different<00:02:25.750> appearance<00:02:26.170> already

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
very different appearance already

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.810 
very different appearance already
starting<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> look<00:02:27.100> more<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.340> finished

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
starting to look more like finished

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.270 
starting to look more like finished
knife<00:02:27.970> after<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.990> be<00:02:29.200> blasted<00:02:29.710> or<00:02:29.800> sandblast

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
knife after you be blasted or sandblast

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.010 
knife after you be blasted or sandblast
it<00:02:30.490> don't<00:02:31.060> touch<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.270> with<00:02:31.480> your<00:02:31.510> bare<00:02:31.630> hands

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
it don't touch it with your bare hands

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.240 
it don't touch it with your bare hands
because<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.320> oils<00:02:32.590> from<00:02:32.650> your<00:02:32.740> fingers<00:02:32.830> can

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
because the oils from your fingers can

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
because the oils from your fingers can
get<00:02:33.400> down<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> pores<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.300> just<00:02:34.510> created

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
get down in the pores you just created

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.530 
get down in the pores you just created
it<00:02:35.710> can<00:02:35.980> kind<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.820> make<00:02:36.910> your<00:02:37.090> finish<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> little

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it can kind of make your finish a little

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.330 
it can kind of make your finish a little
more<00:02:37.690> difficult<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.110> achieve<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.100> from<00:02:39.250> here

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
more difficult to achieve so from here

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.950 
more difficult to achieve so from here
we're<00:02:39.460> going<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.640> move<00:02:39.760> over<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
we're going to move over to the to the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.140 
we're going to move over to the to the
buffing<00:02:41.830> wheel<00:02:42.010> we're<00:02:42.610> going<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.790> start<00:02:42.940> our

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
buffing wheel we're going to start our

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
buffing wheel we're going to start our
compounds<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> start<00:02:44.260> making<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.650> finish

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
compounds to start making this finish

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.620 
compounds to start making this finish
alright<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.010> with<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.910> kind<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.210> finish<00:02:49.480> I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
alright so with this kind of finish I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.080 
alright so with this kind of finish I
start<00:02:49.930> with<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> brown<00:02:50.320> compound<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.940> you've

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
start with a brown compound if you've

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.580 
start with a brown compound if you've
looked<00:02:52.270> into<00:02:52.420> buffing<00:02:52.840> compounds<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.350> all<00:02:53.470> you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
looked into buffing compounds at all you

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.290 
looked into buffing compounds at all you
know<00:02:53.740> there's<00:02:53.950> Mary<00:02:54.550> different<00:02:55.060> ones

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
know there's Mary different ones

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.870 
know there's Mary different ones
available<00:02:55.830> I've<00:02:56.830> used<00:02:56.860> black<00:02:57.310> magic<00:02:57.790> on

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
available I've used black magic on

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.020 
available I've used black magic on
several<00:02:58.240> different<00:02:58.390> things<00:02:59.520> it<00:03:00.520> works<00:03:00.760> better

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
several different things it works better

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.450 
several different things it works better
for<00:03:01.360> some<00:03:01.960> jobs<00:03:02.170> not<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.650> much<00:03:02.830> for<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.310> I

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
for some jobs not so much for this one I

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.310 
for some jobs not so much for this one I
found<00:03:03.970> going<00:03:04.180> straight<00:03:04.480> from<00:03:04.600> brown<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.140> the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
found going straight from brown to the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.650 
found going straight from brown to the
green<00:03:05.530> chrome<00:03:05.910> gives<00:03:06.910> me<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.090> best<00:03:07.330> finish

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
green chrome gives me my best finish

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.230 
green chrome gives me my best finish
with<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.500> finish<00:03:08.800> but<00:03:09.520> if<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.090> are

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
with this kind of finish but if you are

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.210 
with this kind of finish but if you are
going<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.480> go<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> satin<00:03:11.140> finish<00:03:11.170> or<00:03:11.710> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
going to go for a satin finish or a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.550 
going to go for a satin finish or a
mirror<00:03:12.760> finish<00:03:12.940> now<00:03:13.720> you'll<00:03:14.110> end<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.350> using

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
mirror finish now you'll end up using

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.200 
mirror finish now you'll end up using
some<00:03:14.860> other<00:03:14.950> compounds<00:03:15.520> as<00:03:15.610> well<00:03:15.790> there's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
some other compounds as well there's

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.150 
some other compounds as well there's
plenty<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.540> info<00:03:16.780> belt<00:03:17.050> available<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.740> that<00:03:17.920> I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
plenty of info belt available on that I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.040 
plenty of info belt available on that I

Terry<00:03:20.980> breaks<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.430> down<00:03:21.610> really<00:03:21.820> well<00:03:21.940> as

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
Terry breaks that down really well as

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.960 
Terry breaks that down really well as
far<00:03:22.900> as<00:03:23.020> explaining<00:03:23.620> what<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:23.860> need<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.160> do<00:03:24.670> to

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
far as explaining what you need to do to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.550 
far as explaining what you need to do to
achieve<00:03:25.570> those<00:03:25.900> finishes<00:03:26.320> with<00:03:26.440> those

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
achieve those finishes with those

00:03:26.560 --> 00:04:19.279 
achieve those finishes with those
compounds

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.960 

so<00:04:20.289> you'll<00:04:20.470> see<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.650> after<00:04:21.189> the<00:04:21.340> brown

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
so you'll see just after the brown

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.740 
so you'll see just after the brown
compound<00:04:22.599> we've<00:04:23.139> already<00:04:23.289> got<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.560> lot<00:04:23.949> more

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
compound we've already got a lot more

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.029 
compound we've already got a lot more
even<00:04:25.750> finish<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.319> starting<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.680> shimmer<00:04:26.919> a

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
even finish it's starting to shimmer a

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.520 
even finish it's starting to shimmer a
little<00:04:27.340> bit<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.090> after<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.139> use<00:04:29.229> a<00:04:29.259> brown

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
little bit and after you use a brown

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.140 
little bit and after you use a brown
compound<00:04:29.949> you<00:04:30.039> want<00:04:30.219> to<00:04:30.310> get<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> rag<00:04:30.699> out<00:04:30.909> and

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
compound you want to get a rag out and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.059 
compound you want to get a rag out and
get<00:04:31.569> your<00:04:31.659> acetone<00:04:32.080> give<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.830> really

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
get your acetone give it a really

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.589 
get your acetone give it a really
thorough<00:04:33.490> rub<00:04:33.819> down<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.210> don't<00:04:34.389> want<00:04:34.539> your

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
thorough rub down you don't want your

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.540 
thorough rub down you don't want your
compounds<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.169> mix<00:04:35.319> on<00:04:35.439> the<00:04:35.530> wheels<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:36.370> the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
compounds to mix on the wheels is the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.890 
compounds to mix on the wheels is the
head<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:36.729> your<00:04:36.909> cutting<00:04:37.210> compounds<00:04:37.659> like<00:04:37.750> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
head of your cutting compounds like the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.529 
head of your cutting compounds like the
brown<00:04:38.139> will<00:04:38.889> take<00:04:39.099> this<00:04:39.280> wheel<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.849> then<00:04:40.300> it's

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
brown will take this wheel and then it's

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.820 
brown will take this wheel and then it's
not<00:04:40.659> going<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.870> polish<00:04:41.139> anymore<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:41.680> going

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
not going to polish anymore it's going

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.640 
not going to polish anymore it's going
to<00:04:41.889> cut<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:43.150> be<00:04:43.810> sure<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:43.990> rub<00:04:44.229> it<00:04:44.259> down<00:04:44.349> really

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
to cut so be sure and rub it down really

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.629 
to cut so be sure and rub it down really
well<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:45.069> that<00:04:45.159> you<00:04:45.250> don't<00:04:45.400> mix<00:04:45.520> your

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
well so that you don't mix your

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.730 
well so that you don't mix your
compounds<00:04:46.180> if<00:04:46.719> you<00:04:46.810> do<00:04:46.930> end<00:04:47.080> up<00:04:47.199> mixing<00:04:47.379> on<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
compounds if you do end up mixing on the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.959 
compounds if you do end up mixing on the
wheel<00:04:47.949> you<00:04:48.069> can<00:04:48.219> just<00:04:48.340> end<00:04:48.490> up<00:04:48.550> using<00:04:48.729> that

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
wheel you can just end up using that

00:04:48.969 --> 00:05:18.879 
wheel you can just end up using that
wheel<00:04:49.240> for<00:04:49.479> your<00:04:49.569> heavier<00:04:49.810> compact

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.649 

alright<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:19.759> there<00:05:19.939> you<00:05:20.030> have<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.210> nice

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
alright so there you have it nice

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.800 
alright so there you have it nice
non-reflective<00:05:21.169> flat<00:05:21.979> finish<00:05:22.509> for<00:05:23.509> the<00:05:23.539> blade

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
non-reflective flat finish for the blade

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.779 
non-reflective flat finish for the blade
now<00:05:24.590> we're<00:05:24.919> going<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.069> go<00:05:25.159> back<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.430> do<00:05:25.669> this

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
now we're going to go back and do this

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.279 
now we're going to go back and do this
again<00:05:26.090> with<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.270> buffing<00:05:26.629> wheel<00:05:26.749> so<00:05:26.960> even<00:05:27.199> if

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
again with the buffing wheel so even if

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.709 
again with the buffing wheel so even if
your<00:05:27.669> finishes<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.699> perfect<00:05:29.180> right<00:05:29.360> now<00:05:29.539> as

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
your finishes a perfect right now as

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.480 
your finishes a perfect right now as
long<00:05:29.840> as<00:05:29.990> you<00:05:30.110> look<00:05:30.319> at<00:05:30.499> it<00:05:30.529> and<00:05:31.069> you<00:05:31.129> see<00:05:31.370> that

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
long as you look at it and you see that

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.610 
long as you look at it and you see that
your<00:05:31.669> sandblast<00:05:32.150> was<00:05:32.360> even<00:05:32.719> they<00:05:33.319> will<00:05:33.529> be

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
your sandblast was even they will be

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.369 
your sandblast was even they will be
able<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:33.800> work<00:05:33.949> the<00:05:34.099> rest<00:05:34.279> of<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.550> out<00:05:34.840> yeah<00:05:35.840> of

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
able to work the rest of it out yeah of

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.110 
able to work the rest of it out yeah of
course<00:05:36.590> after<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.919> green<00:05:37.159> crumby<00:05:37.939> going<00:05:38.060> to

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
course after the green crumby going to

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.550 
course after the green crumby going to
go<00:05:38.210> back<00:05:38.389> and<00:05:38.419> clean<00:05:38.719> it<00:05:38.779> off<00:05:38.960> again<00:05:39.319> just<00:05:39.499> like

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
go back and clean it off again just like

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.309 
go back and clean it off again just like
you<00:05:39.680> did<00:05:39.800> after<00:05:39.949> the<00:05:40.069> brown<00:05:40.310> chrome<00:05:40.779> and<00:05:41.779> after

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
you did after the brown chrome and after

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.409 
you did after the brown chrome and after
this<00:05:42.639> we're<00:05:43.639> essentially<00:05:43.909> ready<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.270> start

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
this we're essentially ready to start
