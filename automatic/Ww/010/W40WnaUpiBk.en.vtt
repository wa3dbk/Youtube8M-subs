faith in a quarterback Shane had a good

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.430 
faith in a quarterback Shane had a good
week<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.170> practice<00:00:04.230> he's<00:00:04.890> had<00:00:05.160> good<00:00:05.490> practices

throughout<00:00:07.440> fall<00:00:08.069> camp<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.240> think<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.690> I

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
throughout fall camp and I think that I

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.860 
throughout fall camp and I think that I
talked<00:00:10.559> about<00:00:10.679> earlier<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.940> year<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.360> he

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
talked about earlier in the year and he

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.990 
talked about earlier in the year and he
had<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> good<00:00:13.200> practice<00:00:13.410> last<00:00:13.830> week<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.790> what<00:00:14.940> do

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
again you know mark I think sometimes we

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.519 
again you know mark I think sometimes we
want<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> point<00:00:20.970> finger<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.689> guy<00:00:21.930> because

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
want to point finger one guy because

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
want to point finger one guy because
he's<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> quarterback<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:25.140> think

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
he's a quarterback and I don't think

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.570 
he's a quarterback and I don't think
that's<00:00:25.500> fair<00:00:25.970> I<00:00:27.650> don't<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:28.980> fair<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.720 
that's fair I don't think that's fair I
think<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.240> obviously<00:00:31.340> we<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.700> a

I think that will be an interesting
study<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.370> look<00:02:38.519> at<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.780> didn't<00:02:40.019> have<00:02:40.140> very

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
study to look at we didn't have very

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.559 
study to look at we didn't have very
field<00:02:40.709> position<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.550> put<00:02:41.790> ourselves<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:42.330> poor

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
field position we put ourselves a poor

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.070 
field position we put ourselves a poor
field<00:02:42.930> position<00:02:43.400> on<00:02:44.400> some<00:02:44.760> punt<00:02:45.000> returns<00:02:45.390> and
