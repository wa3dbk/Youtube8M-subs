 terminal that did not bring what was the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.430
 FM Radio

 the previous cross radio fm either

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.690
 we need to install it manually 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.000
 I want to clarify that this tutorial I 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.840
 I 've only tried it on the radio 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.430
 on android 5.0 point 2 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.130
 I do not know if it will work in versions 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.479
 previous operating system 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.060
 but you can try to see if it turns out 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.700
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.009
 download what is the radio apk 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 I'm going to leave it in the description 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.470
 of this video uploaded to mega 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.420
 and let's go to what is adjustments 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.430
 security 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 and check this box that says 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.830
 unknown origins we accept and we go 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 back now go to a browser 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.580
 any files in my case is file 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.580
 explorer 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.770
 and we go to the folder where we have 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.900
 introduced what is the Africa of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.450
 radio 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.460
 let's go here in my case I have it here 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.670
 we give you a click and we give you to install 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.509
 next following the next 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.509
 and install 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.410
 once the radio is installed what 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.860
 we have to do is to open it 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.440
 this radio is the one that brings the axis 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.860
 default 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.630
 that is to say that it will not be necessary 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.960
 use what they are what are the data 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.490
 or the internet only works 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.680
 connecting the headphones to the phone 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.450
 putting it on speaker or listening to 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.450
 normally by hearing aids 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.209
 I'm going to do a test 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.690
 to see that the radio fm works 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.690
