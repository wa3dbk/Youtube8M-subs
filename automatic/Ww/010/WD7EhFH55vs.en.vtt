00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.750
 Good morning my loves we are here at 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.670
 my bathroom one more time because I 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.250
 I want to show you a mask 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.290
 super fast easy that I do here in 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.900
 home with thing this is cheap you 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.900
 should also have on your 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.390
 is to lighten the skin does not lighten in the direction 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.609
 of which it becomes whiter none of this 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.500
 people is just to give a uniform in the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.840
 skin color, I do not use much when 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.160
 hyacinth that was them're no longer giving 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.009
 effect but what I want is not 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.210
 leaving the skin so as equal then 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.760
 once in a while 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.440
 every two months every three months I 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.090
 I make this magic 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.160
 Just how are you using products? 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.190
 when you see the effect 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.080
 It is not so fast and it is not so 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.730
 visible at the first application 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.180
 So overall when I do this magic 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.640
 I ended up doing the 15 days in a row 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.640
 at night to be able to have a result 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.490
 legal and come to get what 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.700
 People are going to do it and I'm going to start washing the 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.479
 covered face use the soap you 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.000
 have to take the hair out of the front 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.619
 I'll use the nikitta beating soap that I 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.250
 I 've shown you for years that it's this. 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.920
 on here 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.380
 it leaves the skin very soft velvety and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.729
 clean but without harming the skin but can 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.240
 be any component that you have in 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.509
 House 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.509
 OK 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.570
 after that the most expensive we'll go 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.630
 to make is basically made of lemon in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.640
 delta of the mandu river he has property 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.490
 bleaches when you've probably already 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.310
 knows but he also has the risk of 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.200
 to stain the skin due to the use of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.840
 same properties then you have to have a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.840
 very careful to do this without 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.450
 sun exposure after're then I see 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.070
 the elections to sleep for the day 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.259
 Next when you wake up wash your face. 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.060
 I also step solar filter to not 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.640
 take the risk of getting skin 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.720
 stained but the risk is small if you 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.550
 do at night because the next day 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 You go there so you'll have residue 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.310
 product on face 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.380
 so I always prefer to do where 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.750
 So, come on, I'll have a little cup. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.420
 meter to use a spoonful of 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.459
 lemon coffee and a spoonful of honey 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.180
 honey for those who have dry skin even because 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:24.110
 has oily skin is wonderful because 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.480
 helps to regenerate it up and it will not have to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.000
 hydration people together after I started to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.040
 wearing the bride's veil had a difference 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.829
 abrupt work and total income mixing 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.750
 these two until forming the ric of the uniform 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.480
 just be careful if you have any sores 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.489
 with a cut on his face because he's going to 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.170
 learn from us knows he does not know if 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.049
 then I get this liquid that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.590
 people did put him in the palm of 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.950
 I'll rub this on my face like it's 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:00.670
 a very brief one of making a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.670
 thin cam more equally 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.750
 avoided the area around the eyes can 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.750
 to arrive so gives you a distance from the 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.100
 and then people I'll keep it at 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.140
 face 20 minutes is between 20 and 30 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.990
 depends on how long I've been and how 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.000
 patience that I 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.400
 that dictation after 20 minutes gives 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.860
 to see that the skin absorbs the product 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.860
 August line but it's even the ball gets 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.630
 pasting because of my okay then 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.370
 Are you doing it at night? I? 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.850
 I recommend that you just wash your face with 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.010
 water to remove all the product and 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.080
 go to sleep, just go 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.800
 name of hydrating the next day 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.720
 morning 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.730
 So you wash again with soap to 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.800
 remove any residue on a sunscreen 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.840
 on the street is how you're doing it 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.400
 Day if you want to do it too I'll go 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.750
 there again with the soap because 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.700
 I said I do not want to leave any residue 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.980
 You can leave me a plate from here. 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.700
 little and new sunscreen in the rojita 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.970
 so let's just get there then people 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.590
 Like I said it's a lightening. 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.080
 progressive in that it will not do 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.420
 desired effect on the first application 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.310
 but in the first application you already 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.690
 notice that the skin gets healthier 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.660
 that she is more is softer because 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.330
 of honey to more than 30 is worth a lot 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.610
 Such a pity , he lost a little time before 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.470
 sleeping doing is something else that I 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.130
 I was remembering that I did not mention it. 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.620
 that if you do not usually choose the face 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.120
 usually over the course of the week if 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.110
 You're one of those people who never 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.210
 it was the action 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.490
 so you need to do an exfoliation 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.350
 before beginning this process 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.660
 need to do every day but at first 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.640
 make an exfoliation before in one 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.470
 video on the channel with go prescriptions 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.370
 home also in the parade before going 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.470
 leave the video here and there yes you 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.860
 apply the mask for 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.170
 product can penetrate better into the skin is 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.300
