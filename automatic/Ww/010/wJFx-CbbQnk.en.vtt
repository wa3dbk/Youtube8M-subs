00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
came out in 1969 which I thought was

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 
came out in 1969 which I thought was
very<00:00:35.190> interesting<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.420> said<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.660> didn't<00:00:36.930> do

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
very interesting so I said I didn't do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.049 
very interesting so I said I didn't do
well<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.380> school<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.520> thing<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:38.940> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
well in school and this thing here is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
well in school and this thing here is
the<00:00:39.210> call<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> cone<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> learning<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> what

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the call the cone of learning and what

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
the call the cone of learning and what
they<00:00:41.040> found<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.879> people<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.480> me<00:00:42.629> don't

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
they found out is people like me don't

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
they found out is people like me don't
do<00:00:43.079> well<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.260> school<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.980> worst<00:00:44.430> way

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
do well in school because the worst way

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
do well in school because the worst way
to<00:00:44.700> learn<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.210> reading<00:00:45.780> those<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> buy<00:00:46.890> my

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
to learn is by reading those you buy my

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
to learn is by reading those you buy my
books<00:00:47.340> keep<00:00:47.579> buying<00:00:47.760> books<00:00:48.000> though<00:00:48.180> okay<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
books keep buying books though okay so I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.439 
books keep buying books though okay so I
didn't<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.520> well<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.730> school<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
didn't do well in school because I'm a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
didn't do well in school because I'm a
very<00:00:51.719> poor<00:00:52.079> reader<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.829> second<00:00:53.219> worst<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
very poor reader the second worst way of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.959 
very poor reader the second worst way of
learning<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.539> hearing<00:00:55.199> words<00:00:55.440> or<00:00:55.770> lecture<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
learning is hearing words or lecture so

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420 
learning is hearing words or lecture so
kids<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> school<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:59.190> do

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
kids like me in school just don't do

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
kids like me in school just don't do
well<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.420> fit<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.230> lot

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
well because I fit a lot

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
well because I fit a lot
I<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.219> lecture<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.510> poor<00:01:03.780> reader

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I don't like lecture I'm a poor reader

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.289 
I don't like lecture I'm a poor reader
so<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> can

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so you can go up in this as you can

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.060 
so you can go up in this as you can
watch<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.840> movie<00:01:06.869> watching<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> demonstration

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
watch a movie watching a demonstration

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.460 
watch a movie watching a demonstration
all<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.510> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.840> passive

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
all this and this is all kind of passive

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
all this and this is all kind of passive
learning<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.250> being<00:01:11.520> hyper<00:01:11.729> active<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
learning so being hyper active and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
learning so being hyper active and
probably<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> DD<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> way<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
probably a DD this is not the way I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
probably a DD this is not the way I
learned<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> reason<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.320> games<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
learned so the reason I like games and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.200 
learned so the reason I like games and
the<00:01:16.979> reason<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> cash-flow<00:01:17.549> game<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the reason a cash-flow game is a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
the reason a cash-flow game is a
valuable<00:01:18.600> teaching<00:01:18.900> tool<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
valuable teaching tool is when you go to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.020 
valuable teaching tool is when you go to
active<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.259> best<00:01:22.590> way<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> learn<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.790> do

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
active now the best way to learn is do

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
active now the best way to learn is do
the<00:01:24.240> real<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.020> instance<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> want

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the real thing for instance if you want

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
the real thing for instance if you want
to<00:01:26.130> invest<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.700> real<00:01:26.880> estate<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.450> best<00:01:27.720> thing

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
to invest in real estate the best thing

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.350 
to invest in real estate the best thing
you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you can do is go do it if you want to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
you can do is go do it if you want to
play<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> stock<00:01:30.930> market<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.439> got<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
play the stock market you got to do it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.200 
play the stock market you got to do it
the<00:01:33.210> second<00:01:33.780> best<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.170> though<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
the second best thing though is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
the second best thing though is
simulating<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> real<00:01:36.570> experience<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.380> what

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
simulating the real experience and what

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
simulating the real experience and what
Arizona<00:01:38.310> State<00:01:38.790> found<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> cashflow<00:01:40.200> game

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
Arizona State found was a cashflow game

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
Arizona State found was a cashflow game
was<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.520> close<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.210> simulation<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> real

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
was as close to a simulation of the real

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.249 
was as close to a simulation of the real
thing<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.549> why<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> say<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.810> game<00:01:46.079> was

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
thing which is why I say the game was

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.020
