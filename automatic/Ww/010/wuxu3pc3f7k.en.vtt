the reason this research is very

the reason this research is very
important<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.720> because<00:00:40.080> animal<00:00:40.740> studies<00:00:41.100> have

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
important is because animal studies have

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.360 
important is because animal studies have
shown<00:00:41.580> that<00:00:41.610> ultrasound<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.630> cause<00:00:42.840> adverse
