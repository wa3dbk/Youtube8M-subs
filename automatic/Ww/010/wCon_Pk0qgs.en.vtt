00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840 

mmm

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.750 

we<00:00:08.570> view<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:09.440> the<00:00:09.470> physical<00:00:09.920> universe<00:00:10.400> that

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
we view the the physical universe that

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.310 
we view the the physical universe that
the<00:00:10.880> creation<00:00:11.270> that<00:00:11.480> God<00:00:11.780> made<00:00:12.080> as

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
the creation that God made as

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.160 
the creation that God made as
essentially<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:13.210> physical<00:00:14.210> object<00:00:14.420> lesson<00:00:15.020> of

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
essentially a physical object lesson of

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.200 
essentially a physical object lesson of
spiritual<00:00:15.710> truth<00:00:15.950> or<00:00:16.219> or<00:00:16.550> say<00:00:16.820> divine

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
spiritual truth or or say divine

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.200 
spiritual truth or or say divine
attribute<00:00:17.840> so<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.500> question<00:00:18.890> is<00:00:19.100> let's<00:00:20.090> take

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
attribute so the question is let's take

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.930 
attribute so the question is let's take
for<00:00:20.480> example<00:00:20.570> forgiveness<00:00:21.610> forgiveness<00:00:22.610> how

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:22.940 
for example forgiveness forgiveness how

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.910 
for example forgiveness forgiveness how
do<00:00:23.000> we<00:00:23.210> how<00:00:23.480> do<00:00:23.539> we<00:00:23.690> create<00:00:23.900> a<00:00:24.230> food<00:00:24.650> and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
do we how do we create a food and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.700 
do we how do we create a food and
farming<00:00:25.429> system<00:00:25.939> that<00:00:26.750> that<00:00:27.050> physically

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
farming system that that physically

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.070 
farming system that that physically
demonstrates<00:00:28.550> like<00:00:28.970> an<00:00:29.119> object<00:00:29.509> lesson<00:00:29.660> that

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
demonstrates like an object lesson that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.890 
demonstrates like an object lesson that
demonstrates<00:00:30.529> forgiveness<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.660> you<00:00:32.660> know<00:00:32.750> an

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
demonstrates forgiveness and you know an

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.680 
demonstrates forgiveness and you know an
ecologist<00:00:33.770> would<00:00:33.950> call<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:34.460> resilience<00:00:35.390> or

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
ecologist would call this resilience or

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.500 
ecologist would call this resilience or
shock<00:00:36.260> proofing<00:00:36.830> or<00:00:37.040> whatever<00:00:37.430> but<00:00:38.270> I<00:00:38.300> like

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
shock proofing or whatever but I like

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.840 
shock proofing or whatever but I like
the<00:00:38.630> word<00:00:38.750> forgiveness<00:00:39.350> because<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:40.430> fact<00:00:40.640> is

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
the word forgiveness because the fact is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.060 
the word forgiveness because the fact is
you<00:00:41.059> know<00:00:41.149> nature<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.480> not<00:00:41.600> always<00:00:41.899> benign<00:00:42.739> you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
you know nature is not always benign you

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.700 
you know nature is not always benign you
know<00:00:43.190> there<00:00:43.399> are<00:00:43.550> there<00:00:44.059> are<00:00:44.239> wind<00:00:45.020> storms<00:00:45.500> and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
know there are there are wind storms and

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.279 
know there are there are wind storms and
droughts<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.250> floods<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.879> cold<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.420> hot<00:00:47.600> so

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
droughts and floods and cold and hot so

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.040 
droughts and floods and cold and hot so
how<00:00:48.530> do<00:00:48.590> we<00:00:48.680> how<00:00:48.980> do<00:00:49.039> we<00:00:49.250> make<00:00:49.840> forget<00:00:50.840> how<00:00:50.989> do

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
how do we how do we make forget how do

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.670 
how do we how do we make forget how do
we<00:00:51.260> make<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.710> forgiving<00:00:52.989> farming<00:00:53.989> food<00:00:54.230> system

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
we make a forgiving farming food system

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.569 
we make a forgiving farming food system
well<00:00:55.430> obviously<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:55.910> would<00:00:56.030> be<00:00:56.149> one<00:00:56.390> in<00:00:56.899> which

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
well obviously it would be one in which

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.189 
well obviously it would be one in which
the<00:00:58.579> immune<00:00:59.059> system<00:00:59.539> of<00:00:59.629> plants<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.109> animals

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
the immune system of plants and animals

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.869 
the immune system of plants and animals
get<00:01:00.590> stronger<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.129> stronger<00:01:01.340> all<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:01.730> time

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
get stronger and stronger all the time

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.320 
get stronger and stronger all the time
rather<00:01:02.480> than<00:01:02.629> weaker<00:01:03.309> which<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.489> opposite

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
rather than weaker which is opposite

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.880 
rather than weaker which is opposite
what<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.870> current<00:01:06.170> industrial<00:01:06.410> food<00:01:06.830> system

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
what the current industrial food system

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.800 
what the current industrial food system
does<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.640> makes<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> immune<00:01:08.150> system<00:01:08.510> weaker

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
does it makes the immune system weaker

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.450 
does it makes the immune system weaker
and<00:01:08.960> weaker<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.860> have<00:01:10.010> more<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.370> more

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
and weaker and you have more and more

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.390 
and weaker and you have more and more
you<00:01:11.150> know<00:01:11.180> vet<00:01:11.600> bills<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.259> chemical<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.310> know

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
you know vet bills and chemical you know

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.730 
you know vet bills and chemical you know
pharmaceuticals<00:01:14.150> whatever<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:15.439> would<00:01:15.590> be<00:01:15.710> a

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
pharmaceuticals whatever it would be a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.320 
pharmaceuticals whatever it would be a
system<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:17.350> reduces<00:01:18.350> floods<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.330> and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
system that reduces floods and and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.350 
system that reduces floods and and
increases<00:01:20.600> hydration<00:01:21.560> during<00:01:22.100> droughts<00:01:22.460> so

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
increases hydration during droughts so

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.020 
increases hydration during droughts so
we<00:01:23.509> build<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.780> lot<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:23.960> ponds<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.820> these

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
we build a lot of ponds and and these

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.230 
we build a lot of ponds and and these
ponds<00:01:26.329> catch<00:01:26.750> catch<00:01:27.560> runoff<00:01:28.100> when<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.090> when<00:01:29.210> it

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
ponds catch catch runoff when it when it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.550 
ponds catch catch runoff when it when it
would<00:01:29.390> be<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.600> flood<00:01:29.869> problem<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:30.470> people

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
would be a flood problem for people

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.460 
would be a flood problem for people
downstream<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.600> we<00:01:32.600> can<00:01:32.780> meter<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.170> water

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
downstream and we can meter that water

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.270 
downstream and we can meter that water
out<00:01:33.590> during<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.700> regular<00:01:35.509> times<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.829> I'd

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
out during the regular times and I'd

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.319 
out during the regular times and I'd
rate<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> landscape<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.920> would<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.280> one<00:01:40.549> in

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
rate the landscape it would be one in

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.530 
rate the landscape it would be one in
which<00:01:41.630> fertility<00:01:42.320> increases<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.430> increases

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
which fertility increases and increases

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.310 
which fertility increases and increases
but<00:01:44.540> increases<00:01:45.259> from<00:01:45.829> real-time<00:01:46.490> on-site

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
but increases from real-time on-site

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.469 
but increases from real-time on-site
solar<00:01:48.320> solar<00:01:49.220> energy<00:01:49.670> converted<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.149> biomass

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
solar solar energy converted to biomass

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.830 
solar solar energy converted to biomass
not<00:01:51.759> dependent<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:52.850> petroleum-based

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
not dependent on petroleum-based

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280 
not dependent on petroleum-based
chemical<00:01:54.469> fertilizer<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.520> fertility<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.290> so

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
chemical fertilizer for fertility and so

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.030 
chemical fertilizer for fertility and so
we<00:01:57.860> do<00:01:58.040> large-scale<00:01:58.360> composting<00:01:59.360> to<00:02:00.140> to

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
we do large-scale composting to to

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.789 
we do large-scale composting to to
insource<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.420> fertility<00:02:02.750> rather<00:02:03.439> than<00:02:03.649> to

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
insource the fertility rather than to

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.389 
insource the fertility rather than to
outsource<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.789> fertility<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.219> this

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
outsource the fertility and and and this

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.070 
outsource the fertility and and and this
this<00:02:07.670> creates<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.240> tremendous<00:02:08.420> forgiveness

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
this creates a tremendous forgiveness

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.240 
this creates a tremendous forgiveness
because<00:02:09.229> now<00:02:09.380> we<00:02:09.440> don't<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.979> buy<00:02:10.190> the

because now we don't have to buy the
fertility<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:11.360> don't<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.840> send<00:02:12.110> military

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650

this<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.160> beautiful<00:03:10.610> what's<00:03:10.790> different<00:03:11.150> about

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
this is beautiful what's different about

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.470 
this is beautiful what's different about
this<00:03:12.310> how<00:03:13.310> about<00:03:13.520> take<00:03:13.700> another<00:03:13.940> one<00:03:14.090> order

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
this how about take another one order

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.240 
this how about take another one order
you<00:03:15.230> know<00:03:15.320> God<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.770> God<00:03:15.920> of<00:03:15.980> order<00:03:18.040> very<00:03:19.040> much

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
you know God is a God of order very much

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.430 
you know God is a God of order very much
a<00:03:19.280> God<00:03:19.490> of<00:03:19.520> order<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.210> so<00:03:20.570> how<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.780> we<00:03:20.990> have<00:03:21.200> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
a God of order and so how do we have a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.680 
a God of order and so how do we have a
farm<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:21.920> exemplifies<00:03:22.730> order<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.480> we

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
farm that exemplifies order and so so we

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.720 
farm that exemplifies order and so so we
for<00:03:27.260> example<00:03:27.320> we<00:03:27.770> look<00:03:27.920> at<00:03:28.040> nature<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.550> say

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
for example we look at nature and say

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.850 
for example we look at nature and say
well<00:03:28.910> how<00:03:29.300> does<00:03:29.360> nature<00:03:29.690> sanitize<00:03:30.380> behind

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
well how does nature sanitize behind

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.310 
well how does nature sanitize behind
herbivores<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.150> see<00:03:32.360> Birds<00:03:32.720> following

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
herbivores and you see Birds following

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.100 
herbivores and you see Birds following
herbivores<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:34.580> we<00:03:35.060> move<00:03:35.270> the<00:03:35.420> cows<00:03:35.630> every

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
herbivores and so we move the cows every

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.199 
herbivores and so we move the cows every
day<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.590> mimic<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> way<00:03:37.190> herbivores<00:03:37.760> move<00:03:38.030> in

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
day to mimic the way herbivores move in

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.330 
day to mimic the way herbivores move in
nature<00:03:38.570> with<00:03:38.810> with<00:03:39.320> wolves<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:39.890> grazing

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
nature with with wolves and grazing

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.880 
nature with with wolves and grazing
patterns<00:03:40.550> using<00:03:41.510> electric<00:03:41.959> fence<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.620> we<00:03:42.650> move

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
patterns using electric fence so we move

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.920 
patterns using electric fence so we move
the<00:03:42.920> cows<00:03:43.220> every<00:03:43.640> day<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.120> then<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.660> couple

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the cows every day and then a couple

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.800 
the cows every day and then a couple
days<00:03:45.050> behind<00:03:45.350> them<00:03:45.740> come<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.760> laying<00:03:47.300> hints

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
days behind them come the laying hints

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.410 
days behind them come the laying hints

ultimately a God of relationship and and
think<00:04:23.540> about<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.900> know<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.110> average

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
think about you know the average

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.170 
think about you know the average
industrial<00:04:24.950> farm<00:04:25.220> today<00:04:25.550> there<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.970> no

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
industrial farm today there is no

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.870 
industrial farm today there is no
relationship<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.500> know<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.010> one<00:04:28.310> species

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
relationship you know it's one species

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.170 
relationship you know it's one species
one<00:04:29.450> thing<00:04:29.780> pack<00:04:30.500> together<00:04:30.710> in<00:04:31.130> fact<00:04:31.400> there

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
one thing pack together in fact there

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.939 
one thing pack together in fact there
aren't<00:04:32.419> even<00:04:32.510> very<00:04:32.810> many<00:04:32.960> farmers<00:04:33.380> yeah

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
aren't even very many farmers yeah

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.869 
aren't even very many farmers yeah
there's<00:04:34.430> nobody<00:04:34.550> there<00:04:34.939> and<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.219> our<00:04:37.550> farm

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
there's nobody there and and so our farm

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.300 
there's nobody there and and so our farm
with<00:04:38.539> all<00:04:38.689> the<00:04:38.840> multi<00:04:39.289> you<00:04:39.830> know<00:04:39.919> multi

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
with all the multi you know multi

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.429 
with all the multi you know multi
speciation<00:04:40.939> is<00:04:41.360> just<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:43.210> literally<00:04:44.210> a

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 
speciation is just is just literally a

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.010 
speciation is just is just literally a
choreography<00:04:45.439> of<00:04:45.680> complex

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
choreography of complex

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.140 
choreography of complex
interrelationships<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.759> different<00:04:49.759> gifts

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
interrelationships of different gifts

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.089 
interrelationships of different gifts
and<00:04:50.300> talents<00:04:51.199> of<00:04:51.259> different<00:04:51.620> plants<00:04:51.949> and

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
and talents of different plants and

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.689 
and talents of different plants and
animals<00:04:52.460> working<00:04:53.150> in<00:04:53.419> symbiosis<00:04:53.810> oh<00:04:54.699> that

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
animals working in symbiosis oh that

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.850 
animals working in symbiosis oh that
almost<00:04:55.879> sounds<00:04:56.360> like<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.659> church<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.710> know

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
almost sounds like the church you know

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.760 
almost sounds like the church you know
and<00:04:58.099> and<00:04:58.819> so<00:04:58.849> these<00:04:59.449> are<00:04:59.779> these<00:05:00.050> are<00:05:00.110> these<00:05:00.409> big

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
and and so these are these are these big

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.429 
and and so these are these are these big
principles<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.539> we<00:05:02.900> should<00:05:02.930> be

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
principles that that we should be

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.629 
principles that that we should be
building<00:05:03.969> into<00:05:04.969> our<00:05:05.210> farm<00:05:05.719> scapes<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:07.310> then

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
building into our farm scapes that then

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.110 
building into our farm scapes that then
just<00:05:08.409> immediately<00:05:09.409> connect<00:05:09.889> with<00:05:10.099> people<00:05:10.460> to

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
just immediately connect with people to

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.360 
just immediately connect with people to

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
help them to realize this is spiritual

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.670 
help them to realize this is spiritual
truth<00:05:13.639> this<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.210> divine<00:05:14.479> apt<00:05:14.719> attribute<00:05:15.379> going

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
truth this is divine apt attribute going

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.150 
truth this is divine apt attribute going
on<00:05:15.830> in<00:05:16.039> a<00:05:16.460> visceral<00:05:16.819> way
