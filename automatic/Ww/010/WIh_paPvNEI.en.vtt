00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
wasn't the biggest fan of it but it's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.260 
wasn't the biggest fan of it but it's
kind<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> growing<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.159> me<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.520> I've<00:02:06.030> seen<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
kind of growing on me and I've seen a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.059 
kind of growing on me and I've seen a
few<00:02:06.329> our<00:02:06.659> channels<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> new<00:02:07.649> layout<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
few our channels with a new layout and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.919 
few our channels with a new layout and
it's<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:09.119> bad<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.660> thurs

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it's like it's not as bad as I thurs

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.630 
it's like it's not as bad as I thurs
first<00:02:10.349> thought<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.520> quite

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
first thought is it's actually quite

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.890 
first thought is it's actually quite
nice<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.810> lot<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:12.959> simple<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.560> can

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
nice it's a lot more simple and I can

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.300 
nice it's a lot more simple and I can
stand<00:02:14.110> while<00:02:14.260> they're<00:02:14.409> doing<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:14.920> across

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
stand while they're doing it so across

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.280 
stand while they're doing it so across
like<00:02:15.489> iPads<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.360> iPhones<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.989> stuff<00:02:17.140> it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
like iPads and iPhones and stuff it's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.670 
like iPads and iPhones and stuff it's
all<00:02:17.409> very<00:02:17.560> similar<00:02:18.010> rather<00:02:18.909> than<00:02:19.090> being

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
all very similar rather than being

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.839 
all very similar rather than being
different<00:02:20.680> cross<00:02:20.829> platform<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.459> stuff<00:02:21.670> which

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
different cross platform and stuff which

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.399 
different cross platform and stuff which
is<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> think<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.480> main<00:02:22.720> reason<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:23.140> did<00:02:23.290> it

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
is I think the main reason they did it

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.809 
is I think the main reason they did it
because<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.890> can't<00:02:24.189> have<00:02:24.489> like<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
because you can't have like the

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.309 
because you can't have like the
backgrounds<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.329> stuff<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.659> an<00:02:25.780> iphone<00:02:26.110> just

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
backgrounds and stuff on an iphone just

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.080 
backgrounds and stuff on an iphone just
doesn't<00:02:26.739> work<00:02:26.950> they've<00:02:27.250> got<00:02:27.519> put<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.849> kind<00:02:28.030> of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
doesn't work they've got put in kind of

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.910 
doesn't work they've got put in kind of
like<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.209> column<00:02:28.629> thing<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.200> because<00:02:29.739> like

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
like a column thing and because like

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.500 
like a column thing and because like
whole<00:02:30.280> world<00:02:30.579> is<00:02:30.760> becoming<00:02:30.849> tablet
