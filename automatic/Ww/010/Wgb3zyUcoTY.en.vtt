00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.590 
hi everyone yesterday I posted a video

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.799 
hi everyone yesterday I posted a video
about<00:00:07.069> my<00:00:07.250> three<00:00:07.550> top<00:00:07.790> tips<00:00:08.059> on<00:00:08.360> painting

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
about my three top tips on painting

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.799 
about my three top tips on painting
clouds<00:00:09.340> and<00:00:10.340> one<00:00:10.519> of<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:10.670> tips<00:00:10.880> was<00:00:11.179> painting

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
clouds and one of the tips was painting

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.140 
clouds and one of the tips was painting
the<00:00:12.019> soft<00:00:12.530> edges<00:00:12.980> I<00:00:13.190> just<00:00:13.730> wanted<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:14.030> follow

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
the soft edges I just wanted to follow

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.990 
the soft edges I just wanted to follow
up<00:00:14.299> with<00:00:15.169> a<00:00:15.230> video<00:00:15.589> today<00:00:15.860> just<00:00:16.430> because<00:00:16.550> the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
up with a video today just because the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.480 
up with a video today just because the
the<00:00:17.360> view<00:00:17.570> yesterday<00:00:18.020> was<00:00:18.199> so<00:00:18.350> far<00:00:18.590> away<00:00:18.680> you

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
the view yesterday was so far away you

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.700 
the view yesterday was so far away you
probably<00:00:19.760> couldn't<00:00:20.060> see<00:00:20.470> exactly<00:00:21.470> what<00:00:21.590> I<00:00:21.620> was

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
probably couldn't see exactly what I was

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.850 
probably couldn't see exactly what I was
doing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.280 

so<00:00:24.910> before<00:00:25.910> I<00:00:26.240> talked<00:00:26.480> about<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:28.250> sharp<00:00:28.520> edges

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
so before I talked about the sharp edges

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.729 
so before I talked about the sharp edges
he<00:00:30.290> and<00:00:30.440> I'm<00:00:30.530> just<00:00:30.650> going<00:00:30.770> to<00:00:30.800> create<00:00:31.100> a<00:00:32.739> couple

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
he and I'm just going to create a couple

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.870 
he and I'm just going to create a couple
sharp<00:00:34.579> edges<00:00:34.820> here<00:00:35.890> on<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.130> cloud<00:00:37.400> and<00:00:37.700> then

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
sharp edges here on the cloud and then

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.150 
sharp edges here on the cloud and then
we'll<00:00:38.030> zoom<00:00:38.270> in<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:39.040> I'll<00:00:40.040> show<00:00:40.310> you<00:00:42.130> what<00:00:43.130> I

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
we'll zoom in and I'll show you what I

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.479 
we'll zoom in and I'll show you what I
mean<00:00:43.400> about<00:00:43.460> softening<00:00:44.090> them<00:00:44.510> up<00:00:48.070> okay<00:00:49.070> so

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
mean about softening them up okay so

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.020 
mean about softening them up okay so
let's<00:00:49.790> say<00:00:49.970> you<00:00:50.000> have<00:00:50.329> some<00:00:51.290> sharp<00:00:52.190> edges<00:00:52.489> up

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
let's say you have some sharp edges up

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.010 
let's say you have some sharp edges up
here<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:54.559> top<00:00:54.770> part<00:00:55.040> of<00:00:55.070> your<00:00:55.130> cloud<00:00:56.020> what

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
here in the top part of your cloud what

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.810 
here in the top part of your cloud what
I<00:00:57.050> like<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.410> do<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.770> take<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.190> little<00:00:58.340> bit<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.550> sky

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
I like to do is take a little bit of sky

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.959 
I like to do is take a little bit of sky
color<00:00:59.090> a<00:01:02.140> little<00:01:03.140> bit<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.410> white<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:04.670> then

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
color a little bit of white and then

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:11.560 
color a little bit of white and then
around<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.509> edges<00:01:09.729> kind<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.820> softening<00:01:11.330> up

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
around the edges kind of softening up

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:21.060 
around the edges kind of softening up
those<00:01:12.229> edges<00:01:12.909> with<00:01:13.909> some<00:01:14.479> sky<00:01:14.840> color

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.300 

so<00:01:22.070> they're<00:01:22.310> not<00:01:22.429> pure<00:01:23.210> white<00:01:24.039> and<00:01:25.039> what<00:01:25.159> that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
so they're not pure white and what that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.539 
so they're not pure white and what that
does<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.789> helps<00:01:25.939> it<00:01:26.210> recede<00:01:27.200> into<00:01:27.649> the

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
does is it helps it recede into the

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.090 
does is it helps it recede into the
background<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:29.270> little<00:01:29.299> bit<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:30.560> if<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:30.920> go<00:01:31.070> a

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
background a little bit and if you go a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.919 
background a little bit and if you go a
little<00:01:31.490> bit<00:01:31.579> more<00:01:31.869> blue<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:38.630> really

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
little bit more blue you can really

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:47.469 
little bit more blue you can really
soften<00:01:39.380> them<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:40.450> around<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.659> edge<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:47.360> it

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
soften them up around the edge and it

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.440 
soften them up around the edge and it
kind<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.719> gives<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.110> nice<00:01:48.289> hazy<00:01:48.909> look<00:01:49.909> around

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
kind of gives it a nice hazy look around

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.139 
kind of gives it a nice hazy look around
the<00:01:50.630> outside<00:01:50.659> edge<00:01:51.319> of<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.770> cloud<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.909> helps

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
the outside edge of the cloud it helps

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.429 
the outside edge of the cloud it helps
it<00:01:53.270> recede<00:01:53.689> a<00:01:53.720> little<00:01:54.020> bit<00:01:54.140> into<00:01:54.349> the

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
it recede a little bit into the

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.609 
it recede a little bit into the
background<00:01:55.270> or<00:01:56.270> connect<00:01:56.720> with<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.319> sky<00:01:57.590> a

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
background or connect with the sky a

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.969 
background or connect with the sky a
little<00:01:57.860> bit<00:01:58.130> instead<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.380> it<00:02:00.380> being<00:02:00.439> such<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
little bit instead of it being such a

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.149 
little bit instead of it being such a
sharp<00:02:01.310> edge<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.909> sticking<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.289> far<00:02:03.530> out<00:02:03.679> from

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
sharp edge and sticking so far out from

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.469 
sharp edge and sticking so far out from
the<00:02:04.280> sky<00:02:04.959> it<00:02:05.959> helps<00:02:06.349> blend<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.939> cloud<00:02:08.239> in<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
the sky it helps blend the cloud in the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.539 
the sky it helps blend the cloud in the
sky<00:02:08.720> together<00:02:12.010> okay<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.400> go<00:02:13.519> back

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
sky together okay then you can go back

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:24.080 
sky together okay then you can go back
in<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:16.459> some<00:02:16.760> white

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.979 

and<00:02:24.599> then<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> clean<00:02:25.290> brush<00:02:26.840> or<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:29.989> brush

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
and then with a clean brush or a brush

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.770 
and then with a clean brush or a brush
its<00:02:31.200> wiped<00:02:31.380> off<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:32.660> with<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
its wiped off you can just go with the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.300 
its wiped off you can just go with the
corner<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.290> brush<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:37.650> kind<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.920> scrub<00:02:38.280> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
corner of the brush just kind of scrub a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.160 
corner of the brush just kind of scrub a
little<00:02:38.670> bit<00:02:38.790> very<00:02:39.030> lightly<00:02:44.360> you'll<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.599> these

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
little bit very lightly you'll get these

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
little bit very lightly you'll get these
nice<00:02:46.500> soft<00:02:46.830> edges<00:02:49.069> that<00:02:50.069> blend<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.880> nicely

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
nice soft edges that blend really nicely

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
nice soft edges that blend really nicely
in<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:52.080> your<00:02:52.230> sky<00:02:53.390> okay<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.599> can<00:02:54.750> even

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
in with your sky okay and you can even

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.340 
in with your sky okay and you can even
work<00:02:55.200> some<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.620> shadow<00:02:56.040> color<00:02:56.400> in

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
work some of that shadow color in

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.660 
work some of that shadow color in
through<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.470> sky<00:02:58.739> little<00:02:59.130> bit<00:02:59.280> parting

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
through the sky little bit parting

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.340 
through the sky little bit parting
through<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> cloud<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> little<00:03:00.360> bit<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.230> it's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
through the cloud a little bit so it's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.309 
through the cloud a little bit so it's
all<00:03:07.500> about<00:03:07.739> getting<00:03:08.180> nice<00:03:09.180> soft<00:03:09.630> edges<00:03:12.319> and

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
all about getting nice soft edges and

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.740 
all about getting nice soft edges and
trying<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.799> eliminate<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:15.180> really<00:03:15.450> sharp

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
trying to eliminate the really sharp

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.110 
trying to eliminate the really sharp
edges<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.430> where<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.519> paint's<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.849> little<00:03:18.030> bit

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
edges and where the paint's a little bit

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.650 
edges and where the paint's a little bit
drier<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:19.049> can<00:03:19.200> kind<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.650> scrub<00:03:20.660> your

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
drier you can kind of just scrub your

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.509 
drier you can kind of just scrub your
brush<00:03:21.930> across<00:03:24.739> you'd<00:03:25.739> say<00:03:26.010> your<00:03:26.190> sky<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
brush across you'd say your sky is

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.490 
brush across you'd say your sky is
drawing<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.450> your<00:03:27.599> cloud<00:03:27.870> color<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.350> little

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
drawing but your cloud color is a little

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.039 
drawing but your cloud color is a little
bit<00:03:28.680> wet<00:03:28.890> still<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.299> scrub<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:30.810> brush

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
bit wet still you can scrub your brush

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.440 
bit wet still you can scrub your brush
it<00:03:31.200> across<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.940> same<00:03:33.180> type<00:03:33.420> of

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
it across and get the same type of

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.770 
it across and get the same type of
effect

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:51.800 

it'll<00:03:41.780> create<00:03:42.020> these<00:03:42.230> nice<00:03:42.470> soft<00:03:42.770> edges

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.860 

so<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> hope<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.709> helps<00:03:53.540> expand<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.630> little<00:03:54.720> bit

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
so I hope that helps expand a little bit

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.250 
so I hope that helps expand a little bit
on<00:03:55.140> my<00:03:55.260> video<00:03:55.530> yesterday<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.310> maybe<00:03:57.209> show<00:03:58.200> you

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
on my video yesterday and maybe show you

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.320 
on my video yesterday and maybe show you
a<00:03:58.410> little<00:03:58.709> bit<00:03:58.800> better<00:03:58.980> about<00:03:59.310> making<00:04:00.060> soft

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
a little bit better about making soft

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.590 
a little bit better about making soft
edges<00:04:01.340> soft<00:04:02.340> edges<00:04:02.700> will<00:04:02.910> make<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> clouds<00:04:03.420> a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
edges soft edges will make the clouds a

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.330 
edges soft edges will make the clouds a
little<00:04:03.780> more<00:04:03.900> realistic<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.740> little<00:04:05.220> more

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
little more realistic a little more
