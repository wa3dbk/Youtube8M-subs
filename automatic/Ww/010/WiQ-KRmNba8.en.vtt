00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.919
 he operated out but every morning and 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.440
 the mornings that I do not go to the hospital operated 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.870

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.200
 I'm a fan, well, grave, I'm a native of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.730
 general 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.330
 I always liked surgery when 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.550

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.990

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.520

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.400
 how to look at a room through the eye of 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.140

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 that you see in the keyhole but 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.890
 the rest of the room 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.080
 really for me not 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.350

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.020
 another morning type ten half and 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.790

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.250
 which is in front of the clinic and there 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.380

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.890

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.150

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.560
 mouth side does not say anything no one says 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.560

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
 and work schedule 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.190

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.670

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.240
 he wants then we come to ask him if 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.780
 you want and if I do not see that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.049

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.220
 but humble as the heart of heart 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.890
 very great people who appreciate me very much 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.019
 who gave me the name because I 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.780
 I have attended most of the operated 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.260
 It has always helped him as I continue to be 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.200
 helping them is the mission that they 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.200
 I commended myself when the day I said that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.569
 I accepted that he put in my name like that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.239
 that at that moment I said good everything 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.160
 that I need to be within my reach 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.180

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.180
 well to fall 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.520
 we process something, we will look for it before 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 to leave everything 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.130
 kabul is with the 8 always say the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.850
 monument to the square of people like 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.850
 they make the statues 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.950
 that person 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.300
 and being doctors I think it's the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.120
 more dignified profession more noble nobler 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.270
 more solidary you have to live it to know 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.270
 what medicine why 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.450
 that Boyle solves a problem to a 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.720
 sick who is destroyed 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.680
 or that hanin comes up psychically wrong 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 that he feels that he got sick is going well 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.860
 your office is the most satisfying 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.860
