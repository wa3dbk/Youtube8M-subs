00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
make it work i think so you can actually

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
make it work i think so you can actually
move<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.060> fly<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.600> add<00:02:03.869> i<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
move in fly it add i don't know if it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.910 
move in fly it add i don't know if it
makes<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> faster<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:07.049> yeah<00:02:07.500> flight

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
makes it faster it's yeah flight

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
makes it faster it's yeah flight
duration<00:02:08.280> three<00:02:08.849> maybe<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.810> sire<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.440> I'm

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
duration three maybe go sire so I'm

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.200 
duration three maybe go sire so I'm
going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.739> try<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:12.180> got<00:02:12.510> depth

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
going to try that now got depth

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.170 
going to try that now got depth
stuff<00:02:13.390> I'm<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.870> creative<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.880> hopefully<00:02:15.880> I
