00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.090 

I've<00:00:00.599> done<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.900> tutorial<00:00:01.530> about<00:00:01.620> one<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:01.949> the

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
I've done this tutorial about one of the

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.039 
I've done this tutorial about one of the
most<00:00:02.220> important<00:00:02.909> aspects<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.570> playing<00:00:03.720> slide

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
most important aspects of playing slide

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.530 
most important aspects of playing slide
guitar<00:00:04.110> which<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.770> damping<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:06.000> either<00:00:06.210> left

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
guitar which is damping with either left

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.600 
guitar which is damping with either left
hand<00:00:06.810> or<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.020> right<00:00:07.109> hand<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.220> really

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hand or the right hand it's a really

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.129 
hand or the right hand it's a really
important<00:00:09.059> technique<00:00:09.450> when<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.780> comes<00:00:09.960> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
important technique when it comes to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.080 
important technique when it comes to
playing<00:00:10.349> slide<00:00:10.800> simply<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:11.940> you're

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
playing slide simply because you're

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.700 
playing slide simply because you're
restricted<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.049> can<00:00:13.259> do

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
restricted to what you can do

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070 
restricted to what you can do
compared<00:00:14.040> against<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.429> six<00:00:14.670> string<00:00:14.940> guitar<00:00:15.299> so

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
compared against a six string guitar so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680 
compared against a six string guitar so
damping<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> big<00:00:16.890> important<00:00:17.580> point<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.600> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
damping is a big important point so you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.140 
damping is a big important point so you
can<00:00:18.840> damp<00:00:19.080> when<00:00:19.500> you're<00:00:19.650> playing<00:00:19.890> note<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
can damp when you're playing note to

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.820 
can damp when you're playing note to
control<00:00:21.660> things<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:22.230> you're<00:00:22.380> playing<00:00:22.650> with

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
control things when you're playing with

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.710 
control things when you're playing with
the<00:00:23.010> slide<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.029> either<00:00:24.180> damp<00:00:24.480> root

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the slide but you can either damp root

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.769 
the slide but you can either damp root
chord<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.310> damp<00:00:26.550> notes<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.510> play

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
chord or you can damp notes so if I play

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
chord or you can damp notes so if I play
chords<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.410> instance<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.519> play<00:00:29.880> open

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
chords for instance I just play open

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
chords for instance I just play open
without<00:00:30.929> any<00:00:31.199> damping<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.130> gets<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.399> bit<00:00:32.579> wild

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
without any damping it gets a bit wild

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
without any damping it gets a bit wild
and<00:00:33.149> they<00:00:33.270> help<00:00:33.450> control<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.170> notes<00:00:34.410> just

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and they help control the notes just

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
and they help control the notes just
crossover<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> busy<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.880> each<00:00:36.059> other<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.809> what

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
crossover and busy up each other so what

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.510 
crossover and busy up each other so what
you<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.920> commute<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:40.040> what<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
you do is you commute so what I do is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.760 
you do is you commute so what I do is
put<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.570> hand<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.230> down

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
put this part of my hand here down

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.340 
put this part of my hand here down
against<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.370> bridge<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.719> actually

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
against the bridge and that and actually

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.279 
against the bridge and that and actually
dead<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> strings<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:49.110> playing

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
dead in the strings a bit so I'm playing

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.130 
dead in the strings a bit so I'm playing
example

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.250 

okay<00:00:56.140> says<00:00:56.410> better<00:00:56.590> packaging<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.660> our<00:00:58.960> plan

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
okay says better packaging so our plan

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.780 
okay says better packaging so our plan

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.649 

just<00:01:09.710> hammering<00:01:10.010> them<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.520> third<00:01:10.700> fair

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.600 

down<00:01:14.079> the<00:01:14.350> three

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.910

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
what I'm doing I'm playing it open for

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.010 
what I'm doing I'm playing it open for
the<00:01:21.009> first<00:01:21.159> two<00:01:21.490> notes<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.750> then<00:01:22.899> I'm

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
the first two notes and then I'm

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.350 
the first two notes and then I'm
shutting<00:01:23.469> it<00:01:23.590> down<00:01:23.649> with<00:01:23.979> my<00:01:24.100> hand<00:01:24.340> for<00:01:25.299> the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
shutting it down with my hand for the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.679 
shutting it down with my hand for the
second<00:01:25.720> two

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.710 

ladies<00:01:32.689> Utah<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.610> lot<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.700> control<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.570> what

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
ladies Utah a lot of control in what

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.830 
ladies Utah a lot of control in what
you're<00:01:35.900> doing<00:01:36.229> but<00:01:36.470> damping<00:01:36.920> with<00:01:37.040> your<00:01:37.190> hand

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
you're doing but damping with your hand

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.990 
you're doing but damping with your hand
there's<00:01:38.840> also<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.650> second<00:01:40.159> method<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.520> damping

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
there's also a second method the damping

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.999 
there's also a second method the damping
which<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.570> when<00:01:41.720> you're<00:01:41.840> playing<00:01:42.229> when<00:01:42.860> you

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
which is when you're playing when you

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.510 
which is when you're playing when you
push<00:01:43.280> hard<00:01:43.700> down<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.540> slide<00:01:45.100> your<00:01:46.100> fingers

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
push hard down on the slide your fingers

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.740 
push hard down on the slide your fingers
behind<00:01:46.670> don't<00:01:47.210> make<00:01:47.509> as<00:01:47.780> much<00:01:49.360> dampening<00:01:50.360> but

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
behind don't make as much dampening but

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.109 
behind don't make as much dampening but
if<00:01:50.869> you're<00:01:51.049> gently<00:01:51.619> touching<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.700> strings

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
if you're gently touching on the strings

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.899 
if you're gently touching on the strings
your<00:01:53.780> fingers<00:01:54.170> hot<00:01:54.530> behind<00:01:54.710> actually<00:01:55.460> dampen

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
your fingers hot behind actually dampen

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.950 
your fingers hot behind actually dampen
the<00:01:56.030> notes<00:01:56.270> off<00:01:58.390> one<00:01:59.390> person<00:01:59.840> who's

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
the notes off one person who's

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.080 
the notes off one person who's
particularly<00:02:00.560> excellent<00:02:01.220> at<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:01.460> technique

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
particularly excellent at this technique

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.980 
particularly excellent at this technique
is<00:02:02.360> Raikou<00:02:02.840> da<00:02:02.950> he's<00:02:03.950> got<00:02:04.250> an<00:02:04.340> active<00:02:04.990> applying

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
is Raikou da he's got an active applying

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.320 
is Raikou da he's got an active applying
the<00:02:06.170> single<00:02:06.590> notes<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.250> really<00:02:07.640> closing<00:02:08.030> them

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
the single notes but really closing them

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.790 
the single notes but really closing them
down<00:02:08.360> really<00:02:08.959> muting<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.800> sound<00:02:14.380> now<00:02:15.380> protein

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
down really muting the sound now protein

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.250 
down really muting the sound now protein
that<00:02:16.040> sample<00:02:16.459> put<00:02:16.610> my<00:02:16.790> fingers<00:02:17.209> behind<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that sample put my fingers behind on the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.309 
that sample put my fingers behind on the
strings<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:19.810> know<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.900> doesn't<00:02:21.049> make<00:02:21.260> sense

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
strings I know it doesn't make sense

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.780 
strings I know it doesn't make sense
because<00:02:21.890> you'd<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.280> thought<00:02:22.430> where<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
because you'd have thought where the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.809 
because you'd have thought where the
slide<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.600> applied<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:24.950> string<00:02:25.459> that

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
slide is applied on the string that

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.210 
slide is applied on the string that
anything<00:02:26.720> behind<00:02:26.900> wouldn't<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:28.010> heard

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
anything behind wouldn't be heard

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.130 
anything behind wouldn't be heard
because<00:02:28.640> obviously<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.510> slides<00:02:29.750> acting<00:02:30.080> like

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
because obviously the slides acting like

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.800 
because obviously the slides acting like
a<00:02:30.200> fray<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:30.890> if<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.370> touched<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:32.060> string

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
a fray so if you touched a string

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.199 
a fray so if you touched a string
further<00:02:33.140> up<00:02:33.320> when<00:02:33.470> you're<00:02:33.590> fretting<00:02:33.769> it

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
further up when you're fretting it

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.880 
further up when you're fretting it
nothing<00:02:35.209> would<00:02:35.329> be<00:02:35.450> heard<00:02:35.660> but<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.530> slide

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
nothing would be heard but on the slide

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.470 
nothing would be heard but on the slide
it<00:02:37.250> does<00:02:37.400> actually<00:02:37.640> make<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.940> difference<00:02:38.360> you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
it does actually make a difference you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.660 
it does actually make a difference you
can<00:02:38.690> still<00:02:38.959> hear<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.650> difference<00:02:40.100> I'm

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
can still hear the difference I'm

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.340 
can still hear the difference I'm
playing<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> fifth<00:02:41.390> fret<00:02:41.600> with<00:02:41.870> my<00:02:42.049> slide

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
playing on the fifth fret with my slide

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.819 
playing on the fifth fret with my slide
if<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.070> played<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> note<00:02:43.959> without<00:02:44.959> my<00:02:45.200> fingers<00:02:45.680> on

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
if I played a note without my fingers on

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.310 
if I played a note without my fingers on
on<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.579> string<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.390> I'll<00:02:47.480> play<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:48.170> with

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
on the string so I'll play it just with

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.150 
on the string so I'll play it just with
the<00:02:48.410> slide<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.780> rings<00:02:51.049> now<00:02:51.650> if<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.799> play<00:02:52.010> with<00:02:52.100> my

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the slide it rings now if I play with my

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.490 
the slide it rings now if I play with my
fingers<00:02:52.700> muted<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.359> strings<00:02:56.380> it's<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
fingers muted on the strings it's a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.900 
fingers muted on the strings it's a
slightly<00:02:57.859> more<00:02:58.160> nicely<00:02:59.320> muted<00:03:00.320> sound

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.520 

so<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.090> actually<00:03:06.180> dam<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.930> either<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.290> left

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
so can actually dam with either the left

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.730 
so can actually dam with either the left
hand<00:03:07.830> or<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.280> right<00:03:09.060> hand<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.319> find<00:03:10.590> on

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
hand or the right hand so I find on

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.070 
hand or the right hand so I find on
cords<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.310> tend<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.670> damp<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.150> my<00:03:12.330> right<00:03:12.810> hand

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
cords I tend to damp with my right hand

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.030 
cords I tend to damp with my right hand
on<00:03:13.790> picking<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.390> new<00:03:16.170> parts

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
on picking on new parts

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.000 
on picking on new parts
I'll<00:03:17.100> use<00:03:17.490> my<00:03:17.520> left<00:03:18.510> hand<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.170> streamers

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
I'll use my left hand to the streamers

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.830 
I'll use my left hand to the streamers
so<00:03:20.430> they<00:03:20.580> go<00:03:20.760> there's<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.030> bit<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> damping

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
so they go there's a bit of damping

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.160 
so they go there's a bit of damping
techniques<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.010> slide<00:03:23.220> guitar

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:04:31.170 

you

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.009 

cool<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:36.289> I<00:04:36.409> hope<00:04:36.560> this<00:04:36.770> helps
