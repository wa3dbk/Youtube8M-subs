all at one at three to four then come

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
all at one at three to four then come
across<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.729> alright<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:55.229> at<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.409> sketch

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
across here alright look at this sketch

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
across here alright look at this sketch
of<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> guy<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.159> let's<00:01:56.640> throw<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> c4<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.390> as

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
of the guy here let's throw the c4 up as

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.690 
of the guy here let's throw the c4 up as
high<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> blow<00:01:59.460> him<00:01:59.610> up

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
high as you can on it and blow him up

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
high as you can on it and blow him up
there<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.479> should<00:02:00.750> give<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> bit<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
there I think should give a bit of a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
there I think should give a bit of a
headache<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.040> sure<00:02:02.130> whether<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.520> yet<00:02:02.670> c4

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
headache I'm not sure whether but yet c4

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.819 
headache I'm not sure whether but yet c4
make<00:02:03.630> sure<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.810> lands<00:02:03.930> at<00:02:04.079> near<00:02:04.290> his<00:02:04.409> head<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
make sure it lands at near his head and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.859 
make sure it lands at near his head and
that's<00:02:05.729> how<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.329> part<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.689> glitch

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
that's how you do part of the glitch

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.449 
that's how you do part of the glitch
here<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.290> come<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.590> run<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.860> here<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:10.459> won't

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
