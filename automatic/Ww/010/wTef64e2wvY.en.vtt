 I'm really entering 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.430
 hungry the recipe that I had in mind 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.689
 is a fideua and for this recipe what 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.509
 you need are the following 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.670
 noodle ingredients in this case 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.320
 used a few medium noodles and also 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.809
 catch and use cilanguage gardens 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 geo let's go for me this is going well with a 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.800
 pair of onions a couple of cloves of garlic 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.870
 spicy chorizo alioli in this case 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.489
 I'm using a steel biopic that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.109
 I just prepared if you do not know how 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.239
 do it as below in the description 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.980
 I'll leave a direct link to the video where 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.149
 you see how he did it and if not in 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.780
 any store what they enter 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.750
 equally laurel 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.280
 turmeric urine oil you can also 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.869
 use saffron but the truth is that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.070
 I use fuqua because I like it a lot 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:12.100
 more its flavor the sweet paprika the wine 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.840
 white and chicken broth good let's go to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.840
 start by preparing the recipe 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 Y 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
 The first thing we have done is to catch and 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.910
 remove the skin from the onion and now 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.420
 with the help of a grater we are going to 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.100
 shut up everything very very film once 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.780
 you have completely scratched the onion what 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 let's do is catch the garlic and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.010
 cut it into very thin slices and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.810
 formalizing it also on the plate 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.810
 together with the onion what I'm going to do 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.330
 now it is to pick and cut four subtractions of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.000
 chorizo in this way we are going to cut 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.060
 the skin and then we're going to cut everything 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.369
 in slices now what that is to catch 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.680
 a pan put it over medium heat and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.330
 I'm going to take a stream cited of oil and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.180
 I'll leave it until I see that it's 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.130
 hot good now that the oil is already 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.320
 is hot what we are going to do is 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.530
 toss the onion and garlic 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.110
 fried there we go throwing until we see 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.760
 that being all cast today is a very day 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.860
 special because I have here the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.940
 supervision of the minister and I do not have 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.930
 there behind 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.219
 and I was watching gossip 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.379
 we see that we already have the poached onion 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:34.340
 until golden color what we're going to do 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.540
 Now it's catching and throwing him already faced us 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.250
 let's do here 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.689
 and I'm going to leave a little in the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.540
 fire until we see what more or less 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.969
 It's well done 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.829
 now we will choose we will initiate the two 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.909
 little sheets of envelopes to leave 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.909
 doing a little 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.760
 now we will take and we will do a little 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.760
 of paprika 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.970
 what does it cost you to fall 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.050
 but only a very small view and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.120
 very little time 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.209
 and we're going to mind a little bit because 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.849
 if it is not a bitter journey 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.410
 stanley to the videos and pretty much the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.110
 as far as I'm going to take is a couple of 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.819
 handfuls per person how are we going to do 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.069
 three then I'm going to use the little hand 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.019
 once we are affiliated what we are going to 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.689
 do is Latinos a few doors 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.489
 so that you like it a little now that 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.139
 we see that the videos are a bit 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.299
 toast what we are going to do is 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.189
 thinkable the white wine of white wine 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.510
 we are going to throw him more than one more point 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.220
 or less is not the same 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.940
 approximately 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.310
 and we're going to get it out of at least 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.470
 Now what we are going to do is take the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.210
 chicken broth and give it a little nothing 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.210
 more until it covers one half 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.830
 only the kanggo video is missing 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.900
 we will make this process until 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.450
 let's see that the videos are more or less 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.580
 that way we give the jump a 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.770
 little by little and every time it is consumed 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.600
 we will return prey 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.570
 the third time it is already a broth of 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.180
 chicken what I do is also throw what 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.810
 which it is a little salt and a little 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.610
 turmeric so that it dissolves well and 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.610
 I was well placed with the noodles 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.080
 once we see that the fideuà 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.490
 practically absorbed all the broth and 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.930
 the noodles too that's what we'll do 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.840
 is to let it sit for 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.789
 approximately 5 minutes once already 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.979
 we have finished with the fideuà the dish 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.139
 is going to present this aspect this is a 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.240
 dish really delicious but what happens 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.970
 that is still incomplete 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.370
 So the aioli remains so now what 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.070
 what we will do is caesar de alioli to taste 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.340
 and remove everything very well then 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.320
 we will have a plate 10 good I'm going to 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.539
 I'm getting hungry and this is 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.039
 cool but I'll remember now 2000 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.509
