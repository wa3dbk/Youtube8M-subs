we're also going to concentrate on using

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.970 
we're also going to concentrate on using
just<00:01:07.040> our<00:01:07.250> third<00:01:07.580> finger<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.990> said<00:01:09.290> anything

that could be used to play them but most

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.690 
that could be used to play them but most
common<00:01:12.829> this<00:01:12.920> could<00:01:13.100> be<00:01:13.159> your<00:01:13.280> third<00:01:13.460> finger

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
and we're also going to be using our

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.280 
and we're also going to be using our
second<00:01:16.070> finger<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.700> help<00:01:16.790> reinforce<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.110> make

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
second finger to help reinforce and make

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.340 
second finger to help reinforce and make
up<00:01:18.470> things<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.799> smoother<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.549> easier<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.880> do
