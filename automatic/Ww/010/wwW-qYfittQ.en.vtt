 machine tool 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 most parts of the podruchnika 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.060
 made of stainless steel bottom 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.060
 part 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 made 6 millimeter stainless steel 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.019
 made such a square 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.620
 Drill three holes in the middle of two 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.010
 holes on again one tool for 10 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 then cut m12 thread there in order 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.739
 to unscrew the bolt from the opposite 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.059
 parties 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.789
 screwed here is such a way 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:55.920
 of duralumin with two bolts on 5 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:01:05.189
 also raised by 2 washer in order 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:06.869
 to increase its reach comes here 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.920
 this part of the handbook of eight 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:16.549
 millimeter stainless steel in the middle 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 about to mill groove on 12 for clamping axis 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.450
 hand made from durali here such 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.479
 we are for the same clip attached by 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 four bolts 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:38.330
 M4 clamps an axle using this 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 here is a lamb he of whom is of bronze and 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:49.039
 screwed onto m6 bolt set 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.220
 this item to press 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:56.820
 podruchnik frame made special HYIP 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.459
 inside m20 thread is cut outside m27 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.970
 check 3 in order to reduce 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.380
 turn evening on the app in order 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.269
 to fix the nut I drilled 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.069
 hole half 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.330
 nuts half hole turned out 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.700
 the bolt 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 I'll show you Mike 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:31.160
 screwed and locked 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:39.019
 4 here is such a bolt him four 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:42.019
 twists elders matching 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
 holes 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.750
 This nut is screwed on here 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.489
 nut from growling and growling but he from 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.250
 stainless steel here is knurling well and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.819
 Nike itself is made of bronze speeches I 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.469
 screwed 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.560
 and put on glue for metal on the nut 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.209
 made this one 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.959
 tubercle to reduce stress 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.959
 when clamping 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 we twist it in order to 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:46.090
 release a quarter turn 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:48.680
 maybe a third is already burning 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.449
 sabbath this part on which the door 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:00.169
 reserve made of stainless steel 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:04:04.790
 I decided not to weld right on to this 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:08.090
 the length of the part is the most axis priority more 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.629
 smaller items in order to reduce 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.629
 those 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.100
 reduce the ship not parts when welding 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.630
 dumped using argon then 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.400
 grinded here this is the workpiece manual and 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:34.560
 and led about half a millimeter when 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:41.250
 welded and screwed with four 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:47.000
 bolts m6 in order that the workpiece is not 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.000
 zakirova posed at a 30 degree angle 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.250
 this part itself this part to the axis 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.020
 welded on at 30 degrees too 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.030
 That is, it turns out if you install by 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:08.580
 handbrake here is 90 degrees 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:13.860
 the handpiece is clamped the horn stands here 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.349
 dead also made such here 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:24.260
 faceplate to clamp 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:24.260
 blanks here thread 24 step and a half and 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:41.070
 can be fixed billets also made 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:48.000
 legs in order to 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:56.400
 it was more convenient to attach to the table itself 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:02.870
 machine such remotely 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.870
 legs like bolts 10 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:19.320
 and also bought a cone resistant second 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:22.830
 room for grandma well, sort of, and all that 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.300
 I wanted to tell videos in this arc to everyone 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.300
 Thank you for watching
