finishing this um I think it's pretty

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.869 
finishing this um I think it's pretty
simple<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:34.560> actually<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.400> good<00:02:35.700> way

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
simple it's actually a really good way

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.069 
simple it's actually a really good way
to<00:02:36.049> get<00:02:37.049> bots<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.620> stuff<00:02:37.980> um<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.599> well

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
to get bots and stuff um or not well

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.399 
to get bots and stuff um or not well
yeah<00:02:40.230> d<00:02:40.799> scripts<00:02:41.189> and<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.669> think<00:02:42.409> RuneScape's

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
yeah d scripts and I think RuneScape's
