perhaps the future the fact remains I
don't<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:00.990> would<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> good<00:02:01.500> idea

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
don't think this would be a good idea

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
don't think this would be a good idea
now<00:02:02.579> there<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:03.960> many

the<00:02:06.149> WWE<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:06.960> say<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.290> occasion

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the WWE I don't say that on occasion

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.260 
the WWE I don't say that on occasion
many<00:02:07.890> times<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.149> those

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
many times but this is one of those

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.729 
many times but this is one of those
occasions<00:02:09.420> where<00:02:09.929> I'm<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> don't<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
occasions where I'm not I don't know I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.410 
occasions where I'm not I don't know I
mean<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.009> can't<00:02:11.340> really<00:02:11.489> judge<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
mean I can't really judge it and I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
mean I can't really judge it and I
really<00:02:12.660> can't<00:02:12.930> classify

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
really can't classify

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
really can't classify
and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.160> can't<00:02:14.400> criticize<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.090> because<00:02:15.600> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and I can't criticize it because it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.380 
and I can't criticize it because it
hasn't<00:02:15.930> happened<00:02:16.110> yet<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:17.390> thinking

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
hasn't happened yet but just thinking

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
hasn't happened yet but just thinking
about<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.740> realizing<00:02:20.490> what<00:02:20.730> what

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
about it and and realizing what what

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.080 
about it and and realizing what what
could<00:02:21.180> happen<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:22.730> don't<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.940> this

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
could happen I don't think that this

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.430 
could happen I don't think that this
would<00:02:24.270> be<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.390> step<00:02:24.600> forward<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:24.990> them<00:02:25.260> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
would be a step forward for them but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.440 
would be a step forward for them but
once<00:02:25.620> again<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:26.040> hasn't<00:02:26.340> happened<00:02:26.459> yet<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.090> I'm

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
once again it hasn't happened yet so I'm

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.130
