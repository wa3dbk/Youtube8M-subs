most of the other scout rifles but it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.920 
most of the other scout rifles but it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
shoots faster that's one of the reasons

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
shoots faster that's one of the reasons

glimmer now the highroad soldier I would

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.450 
glimmer now the highroad soldier I would
definitely<00:02:45.870> recommend<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.530> medium-range

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
definitely recommend a medium-range

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.360 
definitely recommend a medium-range
scope<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.510> don't<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:48.930> something<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
scope you don't want something like the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940 
scope you don't want something like the
longer-range<00:02:51.150> ACOG<00:02:51.780> scopes<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:52.440> simply

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
longer-range ACOG scopes that's simply

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.040 
longer-range ACOG scopes that's simply
not<00:02:52.980> gonna<00:02:53.460> be<00:02:53.640> great<00:02:53.820> for<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> crucible<00:02:54.660> you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
not gonna be great for the crucible you

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.960 
not gonna be great for the crucible you
want<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.350> gun<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.770> be<00:02:55.860> good<00:02:56.070> in<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.310> variety<00:02:56.490> of

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
want this gun to be good in a variety of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.510 
want this gun to be good in a variety of
different<00:02:57.240> engagement<00:02:58.020> lengths<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.190> would

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
different engagement lengths now I would

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.310 
different engagement lengths now I would
definitely<00:02:59.970> recommend<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.720> fact<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.020> would<00:03:01.170> say

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
definitely recommend in fact I would say

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.160 
definitely recommend in fact I would say
it's<00:03:01.470> almost<00:03:01.640> necessary<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.360> full<00:03:03.840> auto

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
it's almost necessary to have full auto

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.980 
it's almost necessary to have full auto
no<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.980> reason<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.420> rate<00:03:06.870> of

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
no the reason is is because the rate of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.470 
no the reason is is because the rate of
fire<00:03:07.170> difference<00:03:07.740> for<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.640> gun<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.090> very

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
fire difference for this gun is very

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.510 
fire difference for this gun is very
slight<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.710> want<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.070> make<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.370> absolute

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
slight and you want to make the absolute

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.600 
slight and you want to make the absolute
most<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:13.170> difference<00:03:13.680> now<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> actually

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
most of that difference now I actually

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.910 
most of that difference now I actually
did<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> showcase<00:03:15.630> video<00:03:15.990> on<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.560> highroad

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
did a showcase video on the highroad

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.510 
did a showcase video on the highroad
soldier

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
soldier

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.920 
soldier
so<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.820> can<00:03:17.940> click<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.270> annotation<00:03:18.390> on

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
so you can click the annotation on

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.780 
so you can click the annotation on
screen<00:03:18.990> right<00:03:19.500> now<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.400> video<00:03:20.700> is

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
screen right now and that video is

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.460 
screen right now and that video is
actually<00:03:20.940> gonna<00:03:21.270> have<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.690> side-by-side

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
actually gonna have the side-by-side

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.610 
actually gonna have the side-by-side
comparison<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.550> rate<00:03:24.210> of<00:03:24.360> fire<00:03:24.570> between<00:03:25.440> this

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
comparison of rate of fire between this

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.460 
comparison of rate of fire between this
and<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.460> normal<00:03:27.180> scout<00:03:27.690> rifle<00:03:28.020> so<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.260> can

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and the normal scout rifle so you can

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.890 
and the normal scout rifle so you can
see<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.890> absolute<00:03:29.370> difference<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.480> rate<00:03:30.870> of

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
see the absolute difference in rate of

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.390 
see the absolute difference in rate of
fire<00:03:31.200> with<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.560> weapon<00:03:31.890> but<00:03:32.040> again<00:03:32.250> it's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
fire with this weapon but again it's

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.580 
fire with this weapon but again it's
very<00:03:32.640> slight<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.630> need<00:03:33.930> full<00:03:34.200> auto<00:03:34.440> to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
very slight so you need full auto to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.580 
very slight so you need full auto to
capitalize<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.520> this<00:03:36.090> difference<00:03:36.600> moving<00:03:37.440> on

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
capitalize on this difference moving on

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.320 
capitalize on this difference moving on
you<00:03:37.830> are<00:03:37.980> definitely<00:03:38.250> going<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.760> need<00:03:38.910> a

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
you are definitely going to need a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.810 
you are definitely going to need a
stability<00:03:39.870> increase<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:40.950> went<00:03:41.400> with<00:03:41.520> brace

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
stability increase I went with brace

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.310 
stability increase I went with brace
frame<00:03:42.180> which<00:03:42.360> unfortunately<00:03:42.690> lowered<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
frame which unfortunately lowered the

rifle<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.640> mean<00:04:42.150> there's<00:04:42.420> nothing<00:04:42.660> really<00:04:42.900> to

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
rifle I mean there's nothing really to

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.050 
rifle I mean there's nothing really to
say<00:04:43.290> more<00:04:43.470> than<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.950> kills<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.640> same

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
say more than it kills in the same

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.360 
say more than it kills in the same
headshots<00:04:45.750> as<00:04:46.020> most<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.860> Scout<00:04:47.100> rebels

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
headshots as most of the Scout rebels

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.190 
headshots as most of the Scout rebels
like<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.610> vision<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.910> confluence<00:04:48.060> but<00:04:48.930> shoots

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
like the vision of confluence but shoots

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.670 
like the vision of confluence but shoots
faster<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.550> has<00:04:50.760> one<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.240> if<00:04:51.660> not<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.230> best

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
faster so it has one of if not the best

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.940 
faster so it has one of if not the best
time<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.850> kill<00:04:54.150> in<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.840> crucible<00:04:55.290> right<00:04:55.770> now

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
time to kill in the crucible right now

for<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.280> scout<00:04:56.580> rifle<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.540> damage

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
for a scout rifle so the damage

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.740 
for a scout rifle so the damage
potential<00:04:58.620> for<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:58.950> gun<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.370> insane<00:05:00.240> now

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
potential for this gun is insane now

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.630 
potential for this gun is insane now
unfortunately<00:05:01.380> when<00:05:01.590> you<00:05:01.680> start<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:02.040> get<00:05:02.190> body

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
unfortunately when you start to get body

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.880

soldier does falter a little bit you

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.210 
soldier does falter a little bit you
know<00:05:06.570> no<00:05:06.870> matter<00:05:07.050> how<00:05:07.230> good<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.620> are<00:05:07.650> you're

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
know no matter how good you are you're

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.070 
know no matter how good you are you're
gonna<00:05:08.490> encounter<00:05:09.090> an<00:05:09.300> enemy<00:05:09.360> that's<00:05:09.630> jumping

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
gonna encounter an enemy that's jumping

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.690 
gonna encounter an enemy that's jumping
or<00:05:10.200> doing<00:05:10.230> whatever<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.950> you're<00:05:11.280> gonna<00:05:11.400> start

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
or doing whatever and you're gonna start

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.580 
or doing whatever and you're gonna start
to<00:05:11.790> get<00:05:11.910> body<00:05:12.150> shots<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.600> in<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:13.170> case<00:05:13.440> it

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
to get body shots and in that case it

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.230 
to get body shots and in that case it
simply<00:05:13.890> doesn't<00:05:14.040> do<00:05:14.250> as<00:05:14.400> much<00:05:14.430> damage<00:05:14.910> as

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
simply doesn't do as much damage as

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.310 
simply doesn't do as much damage as
something<00:05:15.570> like<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.780> vision<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.110> confluence

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
something like the vision of confluence

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.110 
something like the vision of confluence
so<00:05:17.070> if<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.190> get<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.310> couple<00:05:17.520> head<00:05:17.760> shots<00:05:18.030> and

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
so if you get a couple head shots and

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120 
so if you get a couple head shots and
then<00:05:18.270> start<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.570> get<00:05:18.720> body<00:05:18.990> shots<00:05:19.350> your<00:05:19.950> time

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
then start to get body shots your time

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.680 
then start to get body shots your time
to<00:05:20.280> kill<00:05:20.430> might<00:05:20.640> not<00:05:20.940> be<00:05:21.120> as<00:05:21.210> high<00:05:21.390> as<00:05:21.420> if

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
to kill might not be as high as if

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.260 
to kill might not be as high as if
you're<00:05:21.840> using<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.380> normal<00:05:22.740> scuffle<00:05:23.520> but<00:05:23.970> again

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
you're using a normal scuffle but again

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.570 
you're using a normal scuffle but again
the<00:05:24.450> potential<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.230> get<00:05:25.350> all<00:05:25.590> four<00:05:26.070> head<00:05:26.280> shots

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
the potential to get all four head shots

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.420 
the potential to get all four head shots
in<00:05:26.790> rapid<00:05:27.720> succession<00:05:27.900> with<00:05:28.530> faster<00:05:29.220> rate<00:05:29.400> of

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
fire than most Gaara Falls is insane and

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.430 
fire than most Gaara Falls is insane and
this<00:05:32.100> gun<00:05:32.310> is<00:05:32.490> excellent<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.780> crucible

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
this gun is excellent on the crucible

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.590 
this gun is excellent on the crucible
now<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.040> highroad<00:05:35.550> soldier<00:05:35.970> definitely

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
now the highroad soldier definitely

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600 
now the highroad soldier definitely
isn't<00:05:36.960> at<00:05:37.080> its<00:05:37.230> prime<00:05:37.590> right<00:05:37.920> now<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.520> now

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
isn't at its prime right now and now

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.800 
isn't at its prime right now and now
that's<00:05:38.790> because<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.240> crucible<00:05:39.690> is

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
that's because the crucible is

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.010 
that's because the crucible is
completely<00:05:40.740> overrun<00:05:41.520> with<00:05:42.060> thorns<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.750> last

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
words especially since people are just

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.850 
words especially since people are just

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
trying to use them until they get nerfed

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.150 
trying to use them until they get nerfed

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.610 
for the taken King patch 2.0 but once
those<00:05:50.400> guns<00:05:50.730> finally<00:05:51.630> get<00:05:51.840> nerfed<00:05:52.170> the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
those guns finally get nerfed the

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.010 
those guns finally get nerfed the
highroad<00:05:53.010> soldier<00:05:53.400> could<00:05:53.820> emerge<00:05:54.210> as<00:05:54.450> one<00:05:54.870> of

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
highroad soldier could emerge as one of

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.540 
highroad soldier could emerge as one of
the<00:05:55.080> most<00:05:55.290> competitive<00:05:55.620> guns<00:05:56.010> in<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.340> game

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
the most competitive guns in the game

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.030 
the most competitive guns in the game
honestly<00:05:56.940> it's<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.360> good<00:05:57.690> now<00:05:58.590> let's<00:05:58.860> move

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
honestly it's that good now let's move

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.160 
honestly it's that good now let's move
on<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.520> highroad<00:06:00.000> soldiers<00:06:00.480> performance

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
on to the highroad soldiers performance

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.600 
on to the highroad soldiers performance
in<00:06:01.350> PvE<00:06:02.190> well<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:03.330> PvE<00:06:04.020> it<00:06:04.380> certainly<00:06:04.950> isn't<00:06:05.220> as

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
in PvE well in PvE it certainly isn't as

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.730 
in PvE well in PvE it certainly isn't as
good<00:06:05.850> as<00:06:06.000> it<00:06:06.120> is<00:06:06.150> in<00:06:06.450> PvP<00:06:07.020> it's<00:06:07.170> definitely

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
good as it is in PvP it's definitely

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.490 
good as it is in PvP it's definitely
more<00:06:08.010> of<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.430> crucible<00:06:08.790> focused<00:06:09.570> weapon<00:06:09.930> that's

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
more of a crucible focused weapon that's

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.380 
more of a crucible focused weapon that's
because<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.370> rate<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.730> fire<00:06:11.910> difference

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
because the rate of fire difference

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.820 
because the rate of fire difference
between<00:06:12.690> the<00:06:12.780> other<00:06:12.870> Scout<00:06:13.110> rivals<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.530> very

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
between the other Scout rivals is very

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.350 
between the other Scout rivals is very
slight<00:06:14.310> this<00:06:14.640> matters<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> lot<00:06:15.180> in<00:06:15.270> the

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
slight this matters a lot in the

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.660 
slight this matters a lot in the
crucible<00:06:15.750> but<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.470> impact<00:06:17.040> difference<00:06:17.520> is

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
crucible but the impact difference is

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.880 
crucible but the impact difference is
bigger<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.540> you<00:06:19.230> know<00:06:19.350> you're<00:06:19.500> not<00:06:19.590> trying<00:06:19.770> to

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
bigger and you know you're not trying to

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.770 
bigger and you know you're not trying to
kill<00:06:20.100> enemies<00:06:20.520> in<00:06:20.790> certain<00:06:21.390> amount<00:06:21.570> of<00:06:21.630> head

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
kill enemies in certain amount of head

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.230 
kill enemies in certain amount of head
shots<00:06:22.080> on<00:06:22.290> PvE<00:06:23.070> they<00:06:23.400> don't<00:06:23.580> have<00:06:23.790> the<00:06:24.060> same

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
shots on PvE they don't have the same

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.460 
shots on PvE they don't have the same
amount<00:06:24.390> of<00:06:24.510> health<00:06:24.720> you're<00:06:25.080> gonna<00:06:25.170> have<00:06:25.380> to

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
amount of health you're gonna have to

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.920 
amount of health you're gonna have to
shoot<00:06:25.710> stuff<00:06:25.920> like<00:06:26.160> a<00:06:26.250> river<00:06:26.550> captain<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.270> lot

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
shoot stuff like a river captain a lot

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.470 
shoot stuff like a river captain a lot
so<00:06:28.440> you<00:06:28.500> probably<00:06:28.860> want<00:06:29.280> that<00:06:29.520> more<00:06:30.030> a<00:06:30.060> higher

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
so you probably want that more a higher

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.100 
so you probably want that more a higher
impact<00:06:31.110> like<00:06:31.980> the<00:06:32.190> damage<00:06:32.640> over<00:06:32.790> time<00:06:32.970> of<00:06:33.720> the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
impact like the damage over time of the

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.680 
impact like the damage over time of the
highroad<00:06:34.410> soldier<00:06:34.770> isn't<00:06:35.310> as<00:06:35.430> good<00:06:35.880> as<00:06:36.090> the

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
highroad soldier isn't as good as the

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.320 
highroad soldier isn't as good as the
other<00:06:36.870> Scout<00:06:37.230> rifles<00:06:37.350> it<00:06:38.070> advantage<00:06:38.970> again

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
other Scout rifles it advantage again

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.360 
other Scout rifles it advantage again

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
you're probably gonna like it it's still

you're probably gonna like it it's still
a<00:06:45.330> powerful<00:06:45.750> gun<00:06:46.080> to<00:06:46.230> use<00:06:46.440> but<00:06:47.160> the<00:06:47.370> other

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
a powerful gun to use but the other

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.879 
a powerful gun to use but the other
scout<00:06:47.940> rifles<00:06:48.240> are<00:06:48.389> probably<00:06:48.960> just<00:06:49.470> better

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
scout rifles are probably just better

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.790 
scout rifles are probably just better
for<00:06:50.430> PvE<00:06:51.060> keep<00:06:51.720> this<00:06:51.900> gun<00:06:52.110> on<00:06:52.229> the<00:06:52.350> crucible

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
for PvE keep this gun on the crucible

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.170 
for PvE keep this gun on the crucible
it's<00:06:53.190> not<00:06:53.460> that<00:06:53.699> great

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
it's not that great

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.469 
it's not that great
against<00:06:54.930> PvE<00:06:55.410> enemies<00:06:56.010> so<00:06:56.639> in<00:06:56.820> summary<00:06:57.330> the
