00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
pretty cool game just to play for fun

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.890 
pretty cool game just to play for fun

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
will probably be a cheap price and all

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.170 
will probably be a cheap price and all
that<00:03:24.019> kind<00:03:24.169> of<00:03:24.230> stuff<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.680> these<00:03:25.579> are<00:03:25.849> again

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
that kind of stuff on these are again

all the games that Ubisoft is publishing
which<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.639> think<00:03:28.849> are<00:03:29.030> pretty<00:03:29.359> big<00:03:29.599> publisher

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
which I think are pretty big publisher

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.369 
which I think are pretty big publisher
so<00:03:30.980> these<00:03:31.790> are<00:03:31.870> confirmed<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.079> all<00:03:33.139> that<00:03:33.230> kind

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
so these are confirmed and all that kind

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.309

leaving<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.849> traditional<00:03:53.389> platforming<00:03:53.629> of

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
leaving the traditional platforming of

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.020 
leaving the traditional platforming of
the<00:03:54.349> core<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.769> man<00:03:54.949> game<00:03:55.190> so<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.400> think<00:03:55.489> rayman

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
the core a man game so I think rayman

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.789 
the core a man game so I think rayman
raving<00:03:56.299> rabbids<00:03:56.900> i<00:03:56.989> think<00:03:57.169> was<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.319> last<00:03:57.590> one

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
raving rabbids i think was the last one

raving rabbids i think was the last one
I<00:03:57.829> had<00:03:57.919> that<00:03:58.220> game<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:58.669> I<00:03:58.879> didn't<00:03:59.299> really<00:03:59.419> play

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
I had that game but I didn't really play

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.180 
I had that game but I didn't really play
I<00:03:59.690> mean<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.079> beat<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.470> then<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:00.919> never

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
I mean I beat it and then I just never

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.559 
I mean I beat it and then I just never
played<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.609> again<00:04:01.669> so<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.209> kind<00:04:02.359> of<00:04:02.389> one<00:04:02.540> of

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
played it again so it's kind of one of

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.189 
played it again so it's kind of one of
those<00:04:02.660> games<00:04:03.699> zombiu<00:04:04.699> is<00:04:05.120> actually<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.569> zombie
