that ball to be a good out sing or a

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.190 
that ball to be a good out sing or a
good<00:07:33.740> in<00:07:33.860> singer<00:07:34.250> or<00:07:34.520> arm<00:07:35.060> ball<00:07:35.360> or<00:07:35.600> good<00:07:35.960> cover

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.200 
good in singer or arm ball or good cover

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.230 
good in singer or arm ball or good cover
drive<00:07:36.640> and<00:07:37.990> for<00:07:38.990> that<00:07:39.020> you<00:07:39.380> need<00:07:39.560> to<00:07:39.770> focus<00:07:40.669> on

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 
drive and for that you need to focus on

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.100 
drive and for that you need to focus on
all<00:07:41.600> those<00:07:41.750> things<00:07:42.110> which<00:07:42.980> which<00:07:43.460> I<00:07:43.610> mentioned

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.110 
all those things which which I mentioned

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.540 
all those things which which I mentioned
so<00:07:45.110> again<00:07:45.440> I<00:07:45.650> think<00:07:48.010> it<00:07:49.010> has<00:07:49.190> been<00:07:49.220> observed

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:49.550 
so again I think it has been observed

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.550 
so again I think it has been observed
that<00:07:50.290> EQ<00:07:51.290> is<00:07:51.320> better<00:07:51.590> than<00:07:51.800> IQ<00:07:53.560> emotional

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 
that EQ is better than IQ emotional

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.950 
that EQ is better than IQ emotional
control<00:07:54.890> a<00:07:55.250> guy<00:07:55.820> was<00:07:56.090> an<00:07:56.300> emotional<00:07:56.510> control

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 
control a guy was an emotional control

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.090 
control a guy was an emotional control
will<00:07:57.590> handle<00:07:58.090> nothing
