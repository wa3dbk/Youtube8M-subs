00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.600
 We now visit the firm JBS SA a manufacturer of leather purses and 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.760
 We talk like this with the manager Cristian Crossa here talks about the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.980
 products and also from the opening of new premises to impose this 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
 classic style brand in the country let's give it 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.609
 a leather goods factory tweaking the points a little 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.320
 cristian how it was in this that was Inca and also the project that has 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.340
 as a company to be able to export maybe remembering me also parante or 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.059
 local not if we see the mainly in the center is a position of the table 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.300
 for we are attending cherry 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.850
 six or eight seasons ago but this season covered expectations 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.910
 we did not have great expectations because of the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.150
 part of the semester that was elected quite important decision showed 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.760
 the inner theme regarding the campus among other motorcycles leather products equal 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.640
 the bus terminal a little bit too expensive for the Argentine, coincidentally not 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.550
 we are only trying to the other vein the company 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.430
 the total local air departures aena impose a little bad brand 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 just this year at the end of last year there was another local touch that is 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.060
 in palermo 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.240
 we stop 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.869
 in which we are tying up other ends not all the products out cold no 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.760
 It only remains for IvÃ¡n Cuervo and for another 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.030
 We make purses shoes dressed in candomble turrones 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 these eventual we have a product that is why it was exported for quality 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.840
 you have but not now that you have work and that our articles 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.070
 but more than anything we were very consumed by our internal collection production 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 We have a lot of acceptance for the type of portfolios we do if it's a product 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.180
 expensive is a bit more classic style 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.539
 and it's a portfolio that that loot izard 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.340
 several season per bonus what the global mobile has been resounding to the material and a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.549
 little this is to try to start focusing the issue to put everything to position the 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.689
 Canada brand in Argentina because it has a young audience 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.370
 one side a woman 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.520

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.820

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.310
 all day in the box you need a portfolio that is that sight a little 70 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.400
 quality that will be added added charity satiate or materials and the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.660
 termination defer the vote is not only questioned mind we do not have produce 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.909
