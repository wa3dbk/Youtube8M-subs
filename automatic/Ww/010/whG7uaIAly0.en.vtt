right now foam domes foam domes the new
wave<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> fish<00:00:14.820> house<00:00:15.000> technology<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
wave of fish house technology and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.620 
wave of fish house technology and
getting<00:00:16.289> out<00:00:16.379> early<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.920> safely<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.510> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
getting out early and safely and this is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.730 
getting out early and safely and this is
basically<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.170> you're<00:00:19.289> looking<00:00:19.320> at<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
basically what you're looking at is a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.370 
basically what you're looking at is a
diving<00:00:20.010> bell<00:00:20.630> these<00:00:21.630> things<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.109> tight

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
diving bell these things are so tight

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
diving bell these things are so tight
that<00:00:22.410> even<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.800> they<00:00:22.890> went<00:00:23.010> through<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> ice

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that even if they went through the ice

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
that even if they went through the ice
they'd<00:00:23.609> sit<00:00:23.820> there<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.029> Bob<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> hole<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
they'd sit there and Bob in the hole so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.050 
they'd sit there and Bob in the hole so
I'm<00:00:25.590> thinking<00:00:25.920> they're<00:00:26.039> made<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> foam<00:00:26.460> yep

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
I'm thinking they're made of foam yep

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810 
I'm thinking they're made of foam yep
they're<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.269> foam<00:00:27.710> what's<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> cover<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
they're all foam what's the cover the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.359 
they're all foam what's the cover the
cover<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.300> polyuria<00:00:31.289> over<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> top<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
cover is polyuria over the top of the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
cover is polyuria over the top of the
foam<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.850> basically<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.329> rhino<00:00:33.570> liner<00:00:33.899> just

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
foam that's basically a rhino liner just

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.850 
foam that's basically a rhino liner just
seal<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> foam<00:00:34.739> from<00:00:35.040> any<00:00:35.250> deterioration

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.639

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's pretty slick is that a thing is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
that's pretty slick is that a thing is
that<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.190> big<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:44.670> making<00:00:44.789> them<00:00:45.120> no

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that as big as you're making them no

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
that as big as you're making them no
we've<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.649> modules<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.489> put

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
we've got these are modules so I can put

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.400 
we've got these are modules so I can put
them<00:00:47.760> together<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.840> tack<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.289> together

them together you can tack them together

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
them together you can tack them together
yep<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> tack<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.399> together<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
yep you tack them together there's a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.189 
yep you tack them together there's a
seal<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> other<00:00:51.629> end<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
seal on the other end of one of the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.810 
seal on the other end of one of the
other<00:00:52.320> houses<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.160> bottom<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
other houses and you just bottom up and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.930 
other houses and you just bottom up and
draw<00:00:54.090> together

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940

habaneros<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.270> say<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.600> too<00:00:58.109> these

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
habaneros I'm gonna say way too these

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
habaneros I'm gonna say way too these
are<00:00:58.859> 1,200<00:00:59.430> pounds<00:00:59.820> how<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.539> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
are 1,200 pounds how much is that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.470 
are 1,200 pounds how much is that
compared<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> regular<00:01:01.500> fish<00:01:01.800> houses<00:01:02.480> you're

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
compared to regular fish houses you're

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
compared to regular fish houses you're
probably<00:01:03.660> looking<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.080> 2500<00:01:04.769> pounds<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.040> it's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
probably looking at 2500 pounds so it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
probably looking at 2500 pounds so it's
less<00:01:05.339> than<00:01:05.519> half<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.970> much<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.420> yeah<00:01:06.619> how<00:01:07.619> do

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
less than half as much way yeah how do

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
less than half as much way yeah how do
you<00:01:07.770> say<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.520> substrate<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you say this is the substrate this is

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
you say this is the substrate this is
the<00:01:15.720> structural<00:01:16.229> integrity<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> house<00:01:17.490> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the structural integrity of the house is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
the structural integrity of the house is
this<00:01:18.090> arch<00:01:18.360> design<00:01:18.979> with<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.250> tongue<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this arch design with this tongue and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
this arch design with this tongue and
groove<00:01:20.850> stacked<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.170> shoot

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
groove stacked and then we just shoot

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
groove stacked and then we just shoot
the<00:01:22.500> polyuria<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:26.090> what<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the polyuria right to it what is this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
the polyuria right to it what is this
this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.560> five-inch<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.220> drew

this is all that five-inch time drew

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.340 
this is all that five-inch time drew

bunch of batteries you got to carry in

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.370 
bunch of batteries you got to carry in
and<00:02:32.650> out<00:02:32.739> they<00:02:33.040> draw<00:02:33.430> very<00:02:33.700> little<00:02:33.910> power

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and out they draw very little power

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.240 
and out they draw very little power
they're<00:02:35.380> more<00:02:35.500> really<00:02:35.650> bright<00:02:35.830> enough<00:02:36.040> at

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
they're more really bright enough at

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.449 
they're more really bright enough at
night<00:02:36.430> no<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.900> then<00:02:38.319> these<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:38.920> basically

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
night no and then these are basically

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.819 
night no and then these are basically
stripped<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.390> way<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.510> got<00:02:40.840> them<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.769> I
