00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.410 
get credit for it on the way I do it is
I<00:00:29.750> take<00:00:30.750> two<00:00:31.140> fingers<00:00:31.439> actually<00:00:31.940> and<00:00:32.940> place<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
I take two fingers actually and place it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
I take two fingers actually and place it
on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.540> bottom<00:00:33.950> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> back<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> cards

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
on the bottom of the back of the cards

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
on the bottom of the back of the cards
kind<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:37.920> where<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> could

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
kind of like this so like where I could

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
kind of like this so like where I could
hold<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> deck<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.379> two

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
hold the deck like that just these two

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
hold the deck like that just these two
fingers<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.420> I'll<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.660> I'll<00:00:42.840> take

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
fingers and so what I'll do is I'll take

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.430 
fingers and so what I'll do is I'll take
them<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:46.050> hard<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> do

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
them like that and then it's hard to do

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
them like that and then it's hard to do
it<00:00:46.559> slowly<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.030> doesn't<00:00:48.270> look

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it slowly as you can see it doesn't look

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.760 
it slowly as you can see it doesn't look
as<00:00:48.570> nice<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:50.030> take<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> put

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
as nice but take it and you want to put

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
as nice but take it and you want to put
your<00:00:52.890> thumb<00:00:54.559> right<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:56.210> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> towards

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
your thumb right here kind of towards

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.709 
your thumb right here kind of towards
the<00:00:57.690> bottom<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.910> slowly<00:00:59.910> move<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the bottom and just slowly move your

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.160 
the bottom and just slowly move your
thumb<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.219> cards<00:01:02.690> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
thumb up the cards kind of like that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.280 
thumb up the cards kind of like that
it's<00:01:04.379> hard<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.830> slow<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:06.570> fast<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.170> know

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it's hard to slow you did fast you know

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
it's hard to slow you did fast you know
you<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> nice<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.430> spread<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.970> looks

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you get a nice little spread it looks

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.149 
you get a nice little spread it looks
something<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
something like that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.910 
something like that
this<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.869> our<00:01:14.080> shows<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.470> takes<00:01:14.650> really

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
this is one of our shows it takes really

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.130 
this is one of our shows it takes really
it's<00:01:15.670> really<00:01:15.820> hard<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.180> learn<00:01:16.330> at<00:01:16.570> first<00:01:16.840> it's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
it's really hard to learn at first it's

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.690 
it's really hard to learn at first it's
like<00:01:17.290> kind<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.619> like<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.740> knack<00:01:18.070> but<00:01:18.369> once<00:01:18.550> you

if it's with another deck like an old
one<00:01:41.429> like<00:01:42.429> this<00:01:42.640> one<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.360> not<00:01:44.050> going<00:01:44.259> to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
one like this one it's a not going to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.520 
one like this one it's a not going to
look<00:01:44.500> as<00:01:44.740> good<00:01:44.950> see<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:46.300> know<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:47.470> because

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
look as good see you know just because

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.340 
look as good see you know just because
the<00:01:47.979> cards<00:01:48.280> are<00:01:48.399> older<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:50.020> not<00:01:50.140> going<00:01:50.229> to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the cards are older it's not going to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.650 
the cards are older it's not going to
look<00:01:50.440> as<00:01:50.619> nice<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:51.190> if<00:01:51.640> you're<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.539> know

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
starting to try this try it with the new

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.870 
starting to try this try it with the new
deck<00:01:55.570> at<00:01:55.750> first<00:01:56.160> makes<00:01:57.160> it<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.399> lot<00:01:57.550> easier<00:01:57.610> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
deck at first makes it a lot easier and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660 
deck at first makes it a lot easier and
