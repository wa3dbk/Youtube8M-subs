so<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.239> requires<00:00:44.480> an<00:00:44.809> internet<00:00:45.079> connection

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
so this requires an internet connection

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.740 
so this requires an internet connection
for<00:00:45.859> the<00:00:45.949> page<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.129> load<00:00:46.340> up<00:00:46.730> as<00:00:47.269> you<00:00:47.629> can

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
your PlayStation 3 controller using the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.270 
your PlayStation 3 controller using the
