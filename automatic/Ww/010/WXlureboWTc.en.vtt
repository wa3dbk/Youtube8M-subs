00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 there is everybody here asynchronously on 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.750
 assetto corse to ultimate episode tutorial 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.440
 We talked last time about 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.300
 pneumatic 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.019
 today we will continue on 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.099
 wheels with camber and pinch 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.870
 so before you even explain 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 how do we adjust the camber I'm going 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 you explain the problem when you 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.869
 are in a straight line your tire 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
 normally to his entire band of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.240
 rolling that touch the track so no 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.949
 of problem you are 100% effective 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 now arrived at the turn everything was going 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.610
 so have a force that will apply 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 on the tire and this one will deform 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.550
 as you see in the picture 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960
 what happens is that so you go 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.790
 have to a part of the tire that is going to be 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.980
 completely crushed on the runway and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.559
 the other one that will be slightly raised 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 see who is going to touch the floor no 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 really say extreme cases this is where 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.770
 that in fact you get the setting from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 camber ie it serves in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.850
 makes up for this phenomenon for 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 when you 're going to have turns and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.770
 including fast turns compensate 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.720
 the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.540
 the fact that your tire is going slightly 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.820
 to be relieved why having everything from 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.760
 following in the situation the effects of 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.930
 camber so I will arrive in my 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.880
 first turn 10 138 so we see I 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.420
 pass normally I spent the second 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.460
 at around 165 camels are camber 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.810
 positive on my four reds precise on 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.120
 see that I had a little trouble keeping to 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.369
 to tell me the joconde braking 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.619
 now I will start again with a 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.790
 camber that will be negative on my 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.170
 four panels ie or 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.610
 inside of my wheels you always 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.979
 hit the ground out castes mistake 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.640
 the outside will be raised and iwork it 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.780
 much better 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 so here I am going to spend a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.270
 first adds then I was struggling there 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.680
 we see that I'm pretty much at the same 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 speed and I have less speed but I pass 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 much better the car does not slip from 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 that my tires are mostly my 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.270
 outdoor tires it's most work 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.310
 here are plated up 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 here is more I would say that you can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.410
 adjust your camber in two ways 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.060
 different 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.159
 you go symmetric mode and the mode 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 asymmetric if you set your 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.430
 camber symmetrically 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 since it is simpler you are going to have 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.479
 a car that will be we'll say enough 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.179
 neutral in all corners oral 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.259
 value themselves behaviors 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.060
 now and there is a little more 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.400
 complicated and push as settings 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.800
 can do a so- called asymmetrical adjustment 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.540
 that is, you set your own 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.610
 four wheels with a camber 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 different how do you take the map 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.080
 of the circuit you watch the turns at 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.560
 left to the right and you look so 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.010
 especially if you have for example 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.290
 big curves right and very little 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 two fast curves on the left and beat there 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.660
 you can adjust with a camber 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.640
 negative you left wheel and a setting 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.610
 ask your people a positive Ã©gÃ¨rement 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 straight wheels for example so 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.640
 to always optimize a your band of 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.579
 rolling that will be in touch with the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.810
 road 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.370
 now that we've seen how to adjust the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.310
 camber will have passed manas at 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 pinch adjustment which is actually the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.850
 same thing but instead of rule 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.980
 tongue of our wheels goal goal 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.340
 behind now is the setting of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.049
 tongue of our wheels but seen from above the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.600
 adjustment of the pinch it is done by 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.920
 train not those of the sncf of course I 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.570
 Of course talk about the train before train 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.430
 back 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.519
 so we're going to decompose so this 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.260
 martyr in two parts so we're going 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.570
 start with adjusting the front axle 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.820
 and the pinch on this one 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.799
 so m of the pinch on the front axle 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.239
 will make sure our car will have less of 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.360
 direction of the fact that the inner wheel 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.090
 when we will start turning to a 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.709
 bad angle of attack because iia 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.840
 pinch on the other hand once 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.700
 will be engaged in the turn this is our 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.989
 or outside which support and by 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.950
 against an attack angle that is 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.830
 just interesting and that's why 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.690
 we put pinch and who will we 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.330
 allow to have a maximum of supports 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.760
 in the turn is a setting that 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.319
 is advised for everything that is 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.819
 fast curve and with big supports 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.500
 so if now the master of the 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.709
 pinching we put the opening on two 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.900
 front wheels so we'll have the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.310
 opposite problem ie our 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.810
 car to have more facility to 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.550
 get into the turns of the fact that 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.570
 our inland water 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.420
 will already be pre-registered in this one 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.430
 but on the other hand it will be more difficult to 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.320
 keep the grip and direction in 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.730
 once we support the fact that 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.800
 our or outside that shot there by cons 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.320
 will not have to attack angle she 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.490
 had just before that so is a setting 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.530
 which is rather advisable for everything 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.180
 which is the slow circuits and the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.490
 turns without support or with support 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.780
 weak of course not so busy 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.160
 of the front train we will take care of the train 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.300
 back 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.580
 Well it's a lot simpler to actually 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.220
 adjust because the pinch setting 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.810
 on the street in celebration lets choose if 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.700
 we go back this table rather a 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.340
 of the top speed we will put 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.940
 pinch and more we will have our 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.690
 back which will be stable and I would say I 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.040
 do not say more we put two 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.320
 openings I mean - but of 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.490
 pinch and more one will have speed of 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.910
 tip astonished that we will be closer to 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.590
 zero knowing that normally one does not put 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.510
 no opening at the back or very very 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.030
 little what he wants to pay attention 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.800
 it is also necessary to put 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.190
 opening or dressing on our 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.610
 roads 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.320
 it will degrade the acceleration reduce the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.630
 peak speed is increased wear 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.240
 view tires so it's always a 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.320
 setting that quite harmful since then who 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.900
 going to be excessive so the goal being everything 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.320
 likewise to be closest to zero 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.780
 may well then this is the end of this 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.889
 third episode we'll be back soon 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.379
 for setting the differentials and 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.729
 and the aerodynamics of the fins in 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.259
 waiting I tell you I want but 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.099
 it must be well then next time 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.099
 go ciao
