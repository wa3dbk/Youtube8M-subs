00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.310 

but<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> tin<00:01:36.930> plate<00:01:37.110> tow<00:01:37.500> hook

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.190 

I'm<00:01:44.830> not<00:01:45.070> sure<00:01:45.340> what<00:01:45.580> year<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.690> tractor

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
I'm not sure what year the tractor

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.399 
I'm not sure what year the tractor
originally<00:01:47.650> came<00:01:47.890> in<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.190> line<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:50.229> I'm

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
originally came in the line but I'm

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.480 
originally came in the line but I'm
guessing<00:01:50.650> this<00:01:51.010> one<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.460> probably<00:01:51.909> from<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
guessing this one is probably from the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390 
guessing this one is probably from the
early<00:01:54.490> 60s<00:01:54.790> early<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:56.229> mid<00:01:56.410> 60s<00:01:56.979> when<00:01:57.280> they

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
early 60s early to mid 60s when they

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:07.590 
early 60s early to mid 60s when they
changed<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.000> rubber<00:01:58.210> tires
