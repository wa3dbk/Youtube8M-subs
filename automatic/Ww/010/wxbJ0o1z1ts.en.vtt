if my superest translation skills were

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.900 
if my superest translation skills were
correct<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.800> price<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> going

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
correct but the price for that is going

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.590 
correct but the price for that is going
to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.120> 6090<00:00:49.110> n<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.280> rather<00:00:50.789> high<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to be 6090 n which is rather high for a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.180 
to be 6090 n which is rather high for a
3ds<00:00:52.020> game<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.649> roughly<00:00:54.469> sixty<00:00:55.469> US<00:00:55.829> dollars

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190

off<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> top<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.820> head<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> along<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.500> the

off the top of my head so along with the
packaging<00:00:59.309> art<00:00:59.489> which<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.120> brilliant<00:01:00.539> i<00:01:00.960> think

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it's drawn by the author himself so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
it's drawn by the author himself so
that's<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.170> interesting<00:01:04.519> along<00:01:05.519> with

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that in the manga and anime so it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
that in the manga and anime so it's
understandable<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> game<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
understandable that the game is going to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
understandable that the game is going to
be<00:01:46.649> above<00:01:46.979> 17<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.060> saw<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> trailers<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

be above 17 but i saw the trailers and
images<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> little<00:01:49.979> while<00:01:50.189> back<00:01:50.490> end<00:01:50.820> quite

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
images a little while back end quite

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780 
images a little while back end quite
honestly<00:01:51.600> i<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.530> disappointed<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
honestly i was disappointed to see the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.499 
honestly i was disappointed to see the
graphics<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.590> play<00:01:56.070> style<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.360> be

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
graphics and like the play style to be

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.420 
graphics and like the play style to be
at<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> level<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.740> especially

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
at the level that it was at especially

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.240 
at the level that it was at especially
if<00:01:59.549> it's<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.210> an<00:02:00.479> above<00:02:00.750> 17<00:02:01.530> game<00:02:01.979> i

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
if it's going to be an above 17 game i

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.149 
if it's going to be an above 17 game i
would<00:02:02.490> expect<00:02:02.689> more<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:04.079> shock<00:02:04.350> factor<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
would expect more of a shock factor and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
would expect more of a shock factor and
more<00:02:05.369> blood<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:06.149> gore<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:07.229> that's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
more blood and more gore I think that's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.050 
more blood and more gore I think that's
what<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> lot<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.890> people<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.520> watch<00:02:08.700> attack

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
what a lot of people that watch attack

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
and the anime so it's going to be a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.949 
and the anime so it's going to be a
little<00:02:47.280> bit<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.669> bummer<00:02:47.939> for<00:02:48.299> them<00:02:48.599> since

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
they're probably going to have to get

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.159 
they're probably going to have to get
like<00:02:50.430> their<00:02:50.609> parents<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.269> buy<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.540> game<00:02:51.870> for

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
like their parents to buy the game for

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.559

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
them mmm and that seems a little

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.959 
them mmm and that seems a little
unnecessary<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.409> I'm<00:02:55.500> sure<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.889> game<00:02:56.519> makers

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
unnecessary but I'm sure the game makers

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.629 
unnecessary but I'm sure the game makers
are<00:02:57.299> doing<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.680> cover<00:02:58.919> their<00:02:59.189> own<00:02:59.340> but

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
are doing this to cover their own but
