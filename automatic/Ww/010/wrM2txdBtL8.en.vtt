00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
in the bag I have these UV sensitive

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.919 
in the bag I have these UV sensitive
beads<00:00:08.550> these<00:00:08.820> are<00:00:08.880> beads<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.389> start<00:00:09.660> white

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
beads these are beads that start white

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.270 
beads these are beads that start white
and<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.320> soon<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.620> they<00:00:10.740> get<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.010> sudden<00:00:11.219> they

and as soon as they get the sudden they
turn<00:00:11.429> color<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.969> watch<00:00:12.389> very<00:00:12.660> carefully<00:00:12.809> rate

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
turn color so watch very carefully rate

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.230 
turn color so watch very carefully rate
it's<00:00:13.230> gonna<00:00:13.320> happen<00:00:13.679> fast<00:00:13.889> hang<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
it's gonna happen fast hang on to it and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.060 
it's gonna happen fast hang on to it and
expose<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> Sun<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:16.740> happens

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
expose it to the Sun see what happens

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.170 
expose it to the Sun see what happens
there<00:00:17.220> how<00:00:18.529> there's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.939> chemical<00:00:20.939> that's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
there how there's a chemical that's

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120 
there how there's a chemical that's
inside<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.779> changes<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.500> ultraviolet

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
inside that changes with ultraviolet

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.620 
inside that changes with ultraviolet
light<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.640> put<00:00:23.789> sunscreen<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> bag

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
light so if you put sunscreen on the bag

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
light so if you put sunscreen on the bag

favorite things to do and so one of them

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400 
favorite things to do and so one of them
was<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.149> couple<00:00:54.660> years<00:00:54.840> ago<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.170> were<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
was a couple years ago we were in the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
backyard with Kim and she had a trash

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.490 
backyard with Kim and she had a trash
can<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.539> might<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> intimidating<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
can and that might be intimidating to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
can and that might be intimidating to
viewers<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.949> somebody<00:00:59.250> suggested<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.879> this

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
viewers so somebody suggested this this

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.880 
viewers so somebody suggested this this
is<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> bucket<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> hole<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is a bucket that has a hole in it so we

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
is a bucket that has a hole in it so we
see<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.190> hole<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> shower

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
see a little hole and then the shower

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
see a little hole and then the shower
curtain<00:01:03.660> gets<00:01:03.750> stretched<00:01:04.049> over<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> side

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
curtain gets stretched over the side

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
curtain gets stretched over the side
fair<00:01:05.189> enough<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.180> down<00:01:06.720> inside

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
fair enough all right so now down inside

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.250 
fair enough all right so now down inside
here<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.670> start<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.720> piece<00:01:10.760> good

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
here we kind of start this piece good

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
here we kind of start this piece good
this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> something<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.240> doesn't<00:01:15.240> fly

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
this is something that doesn't fly

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
this is something that doesn't fly
doesn't<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:17.130> fly<00:01:17.280> again<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
doesn't doesn't fly again so we get a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.030 
doesn't doesn't fly again so we get a
little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> smoke<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> smoke

little bit of smoke so you see the smoke
that<00:01:23.189> starts<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> come<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.960> capture

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that starts to come out and we capture

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
that starts to come out and we capture
some<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> smoke<00:01:26.040> since<00:01:26.580> yeah<00:01:26.670> we're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
some of the smoke since yeah we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399 
some of the smoke since yeah we're
capturing<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.330> s'mores<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:27.930> now<00:01:28.290> I'm

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
capturing the s'mores because now I'm
