00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.009
Eggplants...lots of types of eggplants. You're gonna see the black beauty

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.250
You're gonna see the Japanese eggplant
and also

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.100
the wonderful great tasting white eggplants

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.090
so there we are all - all types of eggplants right here for you

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.600
so let's get started. So to successfully
grow good eggplants

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.739
you need a few things : You need nice,
warm weather

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.700
eggplants thrive in warm weather so late
spring, summer

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.020
you know excellent time to plant eggplants. They do very well in containers you can

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.320
see it right here

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.469
this one's a black beauty eggplant
growing in a container

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.520
here are some more tips on growing eggplants

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.710
just like tomatoes, eggplants

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.250
will love low nitrogen fertilizers

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.770
they just like phosphorous and potassium
rich fertilizers

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.890
you can go organic you can get all the
organic fertilizers that you like

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.869
you'll see some links in the video
description below

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.049
but do not feed them a lot of
nitrogen as all you're gonna end up with is

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.799
getting big huge green leaves and not
many eggplants

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.299
here's one more trip - in the growing
season

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.040
every 15 to 20 days give some Epsom salt
solution to your eggplants

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.740
it'll make them thrive. So let's start
harvesting some eggplants from these

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.700
containers

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.140
once again these are the black beauty
varieties

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.390
the black beauties is one of the easiest 
varieties to grow here in the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.390
United States in california's zone nine
and depending on where you are

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.680
you might wanna find the best variety to grow locally

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.369
in my experience the best produce that you can

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.009
get out of your garden is by growing

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.340
varieties that thrive locally

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.560
the black beauty is a pretty popular
variety though and it's very easy to get

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.660
seeds in any garden store

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.730
or you can just get the plants and plant
them in your garden

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.200
now let's take a look at some other eggplant varieties

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.170
Now this is a whisky barrel container
and I'm growing three varieties of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.090
plants in the same whiskey barrel. One is a
black beauty that we just saw

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.610
in the beginning of this video there's
also a Japanese variety - the Japanese

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.750
eggplant that you see right here

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.750
and then there's also a white eggplant that's also in the same barrel

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.390
so as you can see here these Japanese
eggplants are ready for harvest

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.459
so the are two nice eggplants full-bodied

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.459
not as much full-bodied as a black
beauty but still packs quite a volume

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.020
so here you see a harvest bowl. It has a
lot of black beauty eggplants that was

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.229
harvested in a day

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.150
as well as some Japanese eggplants

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.930
so now the come to the  most interesting

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.710
next a variety of eggplant - the
white eggplant!

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.930
Now white eggplants grow similar to

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.990
the other eggplant varieties we saw. In
fact one is going in the same whiskey 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.430
barrel as the other

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.210
two varieties of eggplants. The white eggplants of course look white

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.210
very different from the regular eggplanks.
Now as far as taste goes, white 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.000
eggplants have a nice

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.669
rich creamy taste to them
It's very different from the regular

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.819
the purple eggplants that you see and
you'll be amazed at the flavor you

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.159
should try it out if you haven't tried
out white eggplant, you should try it out

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:37.400
its  got a very different creamy kind of
flavor

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.820
and just like other eggplants, white eggplants will keep producing

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.630
throughout the season.
Very easy to grow

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.630
you must try it out if you haven't tried
growing it already

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.440
so that's all we have for you in this
episode

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.960
I hope you enjoyed watching all the
different varieties of plants

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.030
and I'm sure you'll  give it a shot growing
all varieties

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.810
Happy Gardening!
