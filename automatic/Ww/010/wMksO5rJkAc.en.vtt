00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.139
 is the hubbub polemic did not come too 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.580
 details for you is the following you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 must have heard of gamestop if not 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.260
 was only the largest network of game stores in the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.180
 world does not have a gamestop here in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.189
 But there are gamestop in Ireland that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 I've been in New Zealand is in 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 at the door of the whole world has no 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 Brazil which is obviously not profitable 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.760
 for gamestop is in brazil but it is the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 largest franchise of one of the largest 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.010
 franchises in the world and certainly the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 of games is there within the states 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 which is the largest consumer market 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 from game to game stop absolutely one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.579
 of companies that produce lots of money 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
 Do you know when you talk about companies? 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.510
 capitalist type mcdonald sa that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.829
 play is so great that gamers 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.690
 between people who love 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.370
 gamestop people who just hate 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 to gamestop want the store to come to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.879
 want everyone to understand the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.649
 Finally, the pile is very tense when 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.480
 it comes about gamestop but people 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.580
 hate gamestop because they buy 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.409
 games for a ridiculous amount like you 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 takes a $ 60 game there that you 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.360
 put on your game did not like it and take it there 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.150
 they will pay 17 11 dollars and they will 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.869
 resold game after type 48 50 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.100
 dollars 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 then people consider that this 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880
 practice is not very fair but there are many 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 people who make god market continues 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 moving at last in my 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.650
 humble opinion I think everyone does the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.000
 what you want with your product so if I 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.860
 want to sell for $ 10 on gamestop 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.659
 the wind if you want to sell by 20 on ebay 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.189
 or seeing fucking nobody has anything to do 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.290
 With that I do not understand that people 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.090
 have a mania for criticizing people 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.729
 sue because the person is silly day 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.560
 She was directly her mother. 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.390
 come here just to beat the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 game on the gamestop you want humans 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.600
 double pay that you will know that the game 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 I was seeing the painting so you're going 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 have come out winning focus finally take 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.630
 document management but has 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.610
 really people who hate gamestop 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.290
 ox is the following what will be in the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.719
 gamestop junk that buys things so 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.740
 cheap so not reviewed and such imagine 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.090
 One day you may be walking. 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 united states look at a trash can 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
 gamestop find an xbox the year is super 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.360
 normal you look in the trash of the gamestop 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.360
 find something in this style 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.400
 playstation 3 games 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.740
 You 're very close to things. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.060
 with a certain degree of 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.740
 for the skill I think this 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.540
 The word does not exist but it's okay, it 's just the 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.460
 sign that you can fix it 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.690
 back to using that is normal you will 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.750
 In the trash gamestop you will find 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.810
 various consoles games and etc but everything is 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.040
 free for you in the trash just you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.900
 dump in the trash to get these things 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.550
 very cool is not a very good idea because it is 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.560
 this business of having a lot of valuable 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.260
 of a garbage that is something that calls 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.310
 thrash dive that would dive in the trash 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.140
 with some people who do not have money 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.000
 to buy games things stay 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.220
 walking in the trash cans of the gamestop to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.590
 find some products right to stop 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.450
 is that the gringo went there and filmed this one 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.280
 Adventure military fire it is 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.170
 doing this is a very judged thing 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.390
 in the United States because it is dangerous 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.950
 old woman here in Brazil is a crime and not 600 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.440
 Crime slide but here in Brazil you 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.570
 turn others' trash is a crime you 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.430
 You can not do this now. 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.740
 lakes - this climate not only knows that it is something 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.390
 that the explosion does not do because the way 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.310
 that I can play a broken video game 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.070
 in which you want to get a hospital can 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.510
 play syringes used a place a house 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.250
 to play the canopy so you can 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.890
 hurt can give shit then stop 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.420
 bids that do not do it here in the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.700
 brazil also that children and beyond 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.950
 everything besides being able to fuck you still 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.330
 It goes for price but there the loud noise and the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.370
 people are aware that the old 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.010
 Do not do this by taking a dip in the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.140
 mirror touch things on the right gamestop 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.030
 so this forum boy network was there and 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.610
 he filmed things that neither control the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.750
 of gamestop he found but without 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.170
 evil I leave the discussion linck 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.150
 but he found a 50 cds of games from the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.180
 playstation 3 playstation 4 xbox wii 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.250
 xbox 160 against thousands of computers 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.700
 found rhyme headset found a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.350
 Lots of product fuck in the trash and watch 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.600
 the tartÃ¡taba bruno took everything and gave himself 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.460
 well and not old because they can pick up 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.650
 example a cd ie was at risk 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.090
 purposefully done in all 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.950
 risks, which shows that it was the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.660
 gamestop that made that risk 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.060
 destroy to take any chance of 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.820
 concert of that album is taking a risk 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.370
 from side to side of the cd to the controls with 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.650
 cut the headsets with the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.690
 cables also cut off obvious 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.940
 even so many products that the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.140
 gamestop did not take advantage she threw away and 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.000
 throw away she completely destroyed 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.560
 so that people could not at last 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.479
 do what this is the point of the discussion 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.190
 according to the guy in the video he thinks 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.600
 that he is wrong in doing this for 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.860
 that they should donate 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.150
 things for example the hospital of 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.700
 charity everything but me in particular 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.950
 I agree at this point but we will confess 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.810
 that this brother was not there, he dives into the 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.280
 junk and gamestop to donate these things 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.950
 but no one really knows could 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.750
 put things together that she does not 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.760
 uses it and by chance I think it would be 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.190
 totally valid for a hospital to 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.300
 needy children and at least it's more 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.160
 This story is still going a long way. 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.550
 So Carlos thinks it 's just that, it's not just 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.960
 that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.910
 for you to have notion this video of that 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.890
 more than 400 thousand views to 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.470
 gamestop released an official note talking 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.670
 that they do from the products then all 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.410
 products that they consider to be 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.150
 unfit to be sold to them 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.530
 earn money on top of that they 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.830
 gift for institutes such as macdonald's 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.690
 as of children in need as children 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.760
 never hosted a bunch of people there 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.950
 their products so they declare in the 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.750
 facebook they are doing the part of them 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.700
 and that the product is in the trash is 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.960
 because it was not controversial 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.270
 on top of that is that most of those 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.400
 products was completely viable 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.900
 to be repaired 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.340
 video guy talks and says he's going to 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.200
 get his kids hooked up 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.510
 some sites are holders and the stop is the 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.770
 next anyone can 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.840
 according to some people here 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.190
 most of those products are 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.410
 a control or something of the type 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.330
 so people do not consider it right 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.340
 that the game stop does and he left well 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.680
 of course they think gamestop does 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.330
 this to keep people from getting 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.190
 for example a game there in the book you 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.110
 go to gamestop resale he is 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.510
 connected to a ridiculously cool type 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.660
 rough where you come from a game was swimming 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.180
 free on gamestop and something else a point 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.860
 very fucked up gamestop does this 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.170
 to stop people from plunging the 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.670
 garbage to pick things up so if you 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.320
 already knows that in that business will have 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.510
 destroyed they will continue to destroy 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.400
 You pulled because you also in the book then 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.170
 You're wrong, you're messing with the trash. 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.150
 gamestop to get some things anyway 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.560
 It's hard to believe in a store. 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.700
 gamestop I 'm no longer official but 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.110
 It seems you will not touch the subject any more. 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.460
 youtube does not stop talking about it the 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.780
 people are trying to boycott the 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.490
 gamestop thing that will not happen 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.320
 because master is not tuned on 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.060
 these things but should know the opinion 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.590
 of you that you think the person 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.080
 you could find a playstation 4 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.890
 trashed a store shopping 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.950
 videogames and you would not do that on 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.780
 Brazil, this fuck is against the law, you do not 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.280
 can leave the trash of people beyond 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.260
 You can still get hurt a lot. 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.009
 Seriously expecting in are worst thing
