the stylus I'm sure if you get a start
with<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.650> doesn't<00:01:05.280> seem<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
with this one it doesn't seem like that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
with this one it doesn't seem like that
and<00:01:06.180> that's<00:01:06.360> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> random<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.320> get

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and that's kind of random if you get

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
and that's kind of random if you get
that<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.159> smartphone<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.119> this

that on the smartphone but not on this
big<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:11.280> weird<00:01:11.689> 1280<00:01:12.689> x<00:01:12.840> 800

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
big one I think little weird 1280 x 800

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.700 
big one I think little weird 1280 x 800
resolution<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.150> same<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
resolution it's like it's the same a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
resolution it's like it's the same a
display<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.890> well<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.610> used<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
display as well as we used on the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.109 
display as well as we used on the
smaller<00:01:18.600> smartphone<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.350> smaller<00:01:20.090> 5.3<00:01:21.090> inch

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
smaller smartphone or smaller 5.3 inch

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.109 
smaller smartphone or smaller 5.3 inch
still<00:01:21.570> pretty<00:01:21.810> good<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.310> simple<00:01:23.700> 7

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
still pretty good but this is a simple 7

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.760 
still pretty good but this is a simple 7
inch<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.490> 77.7<00:01:26.490> each<00:01:26.729> version<00:01:26.939> I
