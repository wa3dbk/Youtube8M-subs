something from the moment the game
starts<00:01:38.460> until<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> nuke<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.570> it's

challenging<00:03:51.470> in<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.650> way<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.880> that<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.209> yeah<00:03:53.840> I'm

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
challenging in a way so that is yeah I'm

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.990 
challenging in a way so that is yeah I'm
really<00:03:54.709> really<00:03:54.980> stoked<00:03:55.220> about<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.550> and<00:03:55.880> I

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
really really stoked about that and I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.840 
really really stoked about that and I
I've<00:03:56.390> sort<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.130> decrypted<00:03:58.130> his<00:03:58.220> interview<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.610 
I've sort of decrypted his interview and
I<00:03:59.030> think<00:03:59.390> dedicated<00:03:59.870> service<00:04:00.140> will<00:04:00.320> becoming

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
I think dedicated service will becoming

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.770 
I think dedicated service will becoming
for<00:04:00.800> pc<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.190> if<00:04:01.490> not<00:04:01.640> I'm<00:04:01.970> very<00:04:02.209> sorry<00:04:02.510> if<00:04:02.690> I
