it's<00:00:39.989> brilliant<00:00:40.770> format<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> i<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.640> there

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it's brilliant format and i think there

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880 
it's brilliant format and i think there
was<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.059> much<00:00:42.210> potential<00:00:42.629> behind<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.710> got

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
was so much potential behind it it got

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
was so much potential behind it it got
sucks<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> huge<00:00:45.120> following<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
sucks because as a huge following the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.590 
sucks because as a huge following the
channel<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.200> doing<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.600> the
