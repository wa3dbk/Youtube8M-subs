to<00:00:05.400> mount<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.879> again<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.109> first<00:00:07.680> take

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
to mount it again to do that first take

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.200 
to mount it again to do that first take
the<00:00:08.160> 8<00:00:08.580> millimeter<00:00:09.120> allen<00:00:09.360> key<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.190> unscrew

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
the 8 millimeter allen key to unscrew

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.570 
the 8 millimeter allen key to unscrew
this<00:00:12.210> screw<00:00:12.269> I'll<00:00:13.259> put<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.040> turn<00:00:14.549> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
this screw I'll put it on and turn it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.870 
this screw I'll put it on and turn it
counterclockwise<00:00:16.279> beginning<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.400> quite<00:00:17.670> hard

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
counterclockwise beginning is quite hard

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.269 
counterclockwise beginning is quite hard
but<00:00:18.150> then<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.390> gets<00:00:18.570> pretty<00:00:18.840> easy<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> far<00:00:21.810> and

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
but then it gets pretty easy so far and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
but then it gets pretty easy so far and
you<00:00:23.279> already<00:00:23.550> took<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> screw<00:00:27.500> okay<00:00:28.500> next

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you already took up the screw okay next

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.230 
you already took up the screw okay next
I<00:00:28.890> take<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> crank<00:00:29.429> extractor<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
I take the crank extractor out of the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.790 
I take the crank extractor out of the
toolbox<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.840> you'll<00:00:30.929> notice<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.769> one

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
toolbox and you'll notice that on one

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
toolbox and you'll notice that on one
hand<00:00:32.250> he's<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> big<00:00:33.059> trap<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:33.899> fits

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
hand he's got a big trap which fits

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.900 
hand he's got a big trap which fits
perfectly<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> thread<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> crank

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
perfectly into the thread of the crank

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.200 
perfectly into the thread of the crank
so<00:00:36.870> now<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.260> gonna<00:00:37.440> turn<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
so now I'm gonna turn it in in the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
so now I'm gonna turn it in in the
clockwise<00:00:39.719> direction<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.920> work<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> pretty

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
clockwise direction this work is pretty

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
clockwise direction this work is pretty
easily<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.879> what<00:00:42.300> shout<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> properly

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
easily so what shout to do this properly

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.580 
easily so what shout to do this properly
um<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.789> works<00:00:44.969> easy<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> doesn't<00:00:46.379> take

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
um it works easy and if it doesn't take

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
um it works easy and if it doesn't take
it<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.800> again<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.149> turn<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> again<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it out again and turn it again as you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
it out again and turn it again as you
can<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.260> turning<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.800> completely<00:00:50.370> in

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
can see I'm turning it completely in

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
can see I'm turning it completely in
with<00:00:50.640> my<00:00:50.820> hand<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.170> turn<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
with my hand which out to turn it in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
with my hand which out to turn it in
completely<00:00:53.070> otherwise<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.760> might<00:00:53.910> damage

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
completely otherwise you might damage

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.170 
completely otherwise you might damage
the<00:00:54.510> trap<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> end<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.520> should<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.879> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the trap so in the end it should be in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.680 
the trap so in the end it should be in
like<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.170> set<00:00:58.440> proximately<00:00:59.359> then<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> take

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
like this set proximately then you take

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
like this set proximately then you take
the<00:01:00.809> screw<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> turn<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.879> far<00:01:03.120> as

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the screw here and turn it in as far as

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.620 
the screw here and turn it in as far as
you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.690> hand<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:05.540> when<00:01:06.540> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you can with your hand as well when you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.200 
you can with your hand as well when you
cannot<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> 50<00:01:08.640> millimeter<00:01:08.820> key

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
cannot more take the 50 millimeter key

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.649 
cannot more take the 50 millimeter key
and<00:01:09.770> turn<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.979> clockwise<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and turn it clockwise to in the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
and turn it clockwise to in the
beginning<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.229> works<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:13.710> hard<00:01:14.100> but

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
beginning this works pretty hard but

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
beginning this works pretty hard but
then<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.990> crank<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.590> already

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
then you see that the crank is already

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
then you see that the crank is already
moving<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> you're<00:01:17.580> extracting<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.540> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
moving and you're extracting it and it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:28.899 
moving and you're extracting it and it's
getting<00:01:19.080> easier<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> easier<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> far<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.560> now

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
getting easier and easier so far and now

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.120 
getting easier and easier so far and now
you'll<00:01:29.909> nearly<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:31.110> able<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> take<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you'll nearly be able to take of the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.660 
you'll nearly be able to take of the
crack<00:01:33.979> by<00:01:34.979> doing<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> rest<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.390> hand

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
crack by doing the rest was your hand

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
crack by doing the rest was your hand
that's<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:39.930> let's<00:01:40.110> mount<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.470> again

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that's it so now let's mount it again

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
that's it so now let's mount it again
watch<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> aligns<00:01:41.850> perfectly<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
watch at that it aligns perfectly in the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
watch at that it aligns perfectly in the
opposite<00:01:43.259> direction<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> other<00:01:44.369> side

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
opposite direction of the other side

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510 
opposite direction of the other side
crank<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.409> taper<00:01:46.409> square<00:01:46.829> axe<00:01:47.040> Wilson<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.460> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
crank on taper square axe Wilson this is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
crank on taper square axe Wilson this is
quite<00:01:47.790> easy<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.270> Isis<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
quite easy on this Isis one here I have

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.350 
quite easy on this Isis one here I have
to<00:01:49.590> watch<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> teeth<00:01:50.460> fit<00:01:50.729> perfectly

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to watch that the teeth fit perfectly

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.530 
to watch that the teeth fit perfectly
into<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> crank<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> take<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.220> screw

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
into the crank then you take the screw

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.929 
into the crank then you take the screw
screw<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.590> hand

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
screw it in a little bit with your hand

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.440 
screw it in a little bit with your hand
and<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:59.250> once<00:01:59.490> again<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.850> take<00:02:00.030> me<00:02:00.180> an<00:02:00.270> 8

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and then once again you take me an 8

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.600 
and then once again you take me an 8
