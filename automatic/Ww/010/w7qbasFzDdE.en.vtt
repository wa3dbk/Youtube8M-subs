like weekly until you find what you're
looking<00:04:59.170> for<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.500> most<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.770> times<00:05:00.010> they<00:05:00.160> will

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
looking for and most the times they will

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.190 
looking for and most the times they will
have<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.270> get<00:05:01.450> these<00:05:01.570> boxes<00:05:01.780> it's

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
have it so I get these boxes it's

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.140 
have it so I get these boxes it's
usually<00:05:02.350> around<00:05:02.680> $5<00:05:03.460> each<00:05:03.640> for<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:03.970> bigger

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
usually around $5 each for the bigger

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.510 
usually around $5 each for the bigger
boxes<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.690> think<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:05.020> closer<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.440> $7<00:05:06.040> but

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520
