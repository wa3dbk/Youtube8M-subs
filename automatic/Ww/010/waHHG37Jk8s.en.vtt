00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
I think the red going across was just

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.349 
I think the red going across was just
because<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.380> know<00:03:09.470> it's<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.739> heartbeat

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.030 
sign so there has been a little bit of
detailing<00:03:14.870> behind<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:15.560> I'm<00:03:15.680> really<00:03:15.769> happy
