while the combat might look similar the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.789 
while the combat might look similar the
overall<00:03:06.389> feeling<00:03:06.629> really<00:03:06.959> is<00:03:07.169> much<00:03:07.409> different

with<00:03:07.919> dragon<00:03:08.280> s<00:03:08.370> being<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.790> overall<00:03:09.419> more

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.119 
with dragon s being and overall more
complex<00:03:10.169> and<00:03:10.349> fluid<00:03:10.680> game<00:03:10.859> in<00:03:11.010> my<00:03:11.099> opinion

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
complex and fluid game in my opinion

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.429 
complex and fluid game in my opinion
with<00:03:11.579> far<00:03:11.909> more<00:03:11.939> class<00:03:12.419> ability<00:03:12.810> combinations

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
with far more class ability combinations

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.680 
with far more class ability combinations
however<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.609> game<00:03:14.849> does<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.389> level<00:03:15.510> of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
however this game does have a level of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.420 
however this game does have a level of
simplicity<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.650> think<00:03:16.979> younger<00:03:17.129> players

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
simplicity that I think younger players

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.990 
simplicity that I think younger players
might<00:03:17.729> find<00:03:17.940> attractive<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:19.139> all<00:03:19.260> about

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
might find attractive it's all about

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
might find attractive it's all about
mayhem<00:03:21.000> destruction<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:22.829> course<00:03:23.040> there's

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
mayhem destruction of course there's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.830 
mayhem destruction of course there's
teamwork<00:03:23.459> involved<00:03:23.849> but<00:03:24.359> there's<00:03:24.569> not<00:03:24.690> as

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
teamwork involved but there's not as

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.449 
teamwork involved but there's not as

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
say something like League of Legends but

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.240 
say something like League of Legends but
it<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.439> really<00:03:28.650> cool<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.099> could
