00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.119
 on the majority of your vehicles so the 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.800

 recommending you will be the der because 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.010
 it's really that this vehicle 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.180
 makes the best so possibly if 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.560

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.300
 do not hesitate to do it in the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.470
 comments on these parts then for 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.359
 start we'll go right away 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.879
 at ls custom then we will go in 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.559
 main color metallic paint 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.069
 once in metallized we will buy some 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.809
 marine worm 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.280
 once the sea worm has bought you 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.379
 will return and you will go in created 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.600
 once in created you go 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.280
 select the glacier white so a 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 times that the main colors in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.670
 as metallic and pearlescent have been 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.809
 selected you will return and you 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.969
 will go in secondary colors 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.799
 you will come back in metallized and you 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.420
 go buy sea worm 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.679
 so once you've bought the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.149
 marine worm you will be able to finish 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.929
 customize the rest of the vehicle as 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.519
 good you seems 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.109
 just for that color I'm going to you 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.820
 recommend putting green neon lights 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 so that will really make a good effect 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.880
 friendly or vehicles and frankly 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.350
 will add a little style the vehicle 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.960
 and especially as soon as it gets dark it will be 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.860
 really beautiful 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.479
 so here we come to the end of this 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.979
 little video I hope she will have you 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.630
 better so before you leave I'm going 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.280
 put a color at the end of the video in 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.440
 all my next color videos 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.400
 and so you will vote in dhr this 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.960
 color that I project you 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.970
 so currently a color that is a 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.140
 mix a bit special but that a 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.460
 time in the sun is really beautiful 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.560
 so it's really a beautiful color 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
