00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.880
 patrick dupond hello to you for day you are co-founder of buying 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.519
 he said so I asked why they put lives for them 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.779
 buyers 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:15.230
 first of all because on the one hand the purchases concern everyone 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.800
 there is little or no media dealing with the real problems of the profession 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.739
 then because we believe that the civilian car 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.749
 at home or mobile office 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.509
 this will become more and more the unavoidable solution for the 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.809
 business to business communication 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.499
 so little by little the job of buyer earned his letters from 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.780
 nobility in smes the big companies in the private sector where the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.860
 public sector 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 in Paris in the program in industry or services 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.240
 wherever purchasing managers have emerged and their positioning in 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.340
 hierarchy are rising more and more 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.330
 However 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 buyers who have not yet achieved recognition 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
 and the maturity of many other professions 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.810
 so bought a little 17 at a time so the subscript is a big 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.130
 opportunity 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.210
 it's a challenge because buyers have to still often 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.140
 see continually prove their added value 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.370
 and if we find little gender in the professional world 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.280
 to challenge the commercial financial legal functions or 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.610
 operational 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 purchases are still very often interpolated 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.710
 on their action 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 see the relevance of it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.050
 ali karti liban so help buyers to be better recognized in the business 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.300
 and it's an opportunity because 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.570
 unlike this deep ction and perhaps also 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.450
 because often questioned the consolidated purchases known for some 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 years a fast evolution and they will not say anymore 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.130
 the arable party exclusively administrative 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.000
 the eyes of the buyers had to appropriate the negotiation the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.100
 grouping of purchases then the electronic tools 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.440
 approaches can not detect buying strategies and now 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.709
 gradually 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.420
 others did not press yet like internationalization the development 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.459
 sustainable or outsourcing 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.530
 buyers who will contribute green contract to his broadcasts his reports these 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.629
 magazines bring a better recognition of the value of the profession 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.659
 buyer 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.339
 typical buyer will also participate 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:33.849
 to the evolution of the profession and a wider dissemination of information and 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.649
 knowledge 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.449

 public 24 hours a day 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:56.549
 seven days on seven 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.400
 and everywhere 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.040
 like at the office or on his pc by car on his audio podcast

 where to be tv is a new technique for disseminating information 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.909
 who is revolutionizing our habits and who is allowing this 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.180
 and precisely what will be the place of wattignies of inhabitants lives in 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.299
 the media world of tomorrow 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.939
 telephone operators phone manufacturers the 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.919
 service providers ad touch 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.649
 an extraordinary explosion of the internet the mobile 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.769
 all imagine that one less than five years old cell phones 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.309
 will replace computers and will do everything 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:38.419
 to get information to learn to communicate to distract oneself 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.979
 and of course pay 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.559
 it's also because there are already three billion phones 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:46.329
 portable based in the world that is to say three times more than the pc 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.519
 because the current consumer trend because the networks 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.439
 is rapidly improving website the mobile is flying 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.269
 for the moment just under 10% of the owners of laptops use 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.279
 their mobile to view internet pages today is a start 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.979
 significant but the flows are still at this time 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.249
 and the cyclic poorly designed for small screens 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.299
 in three years 20% of mobile phones will be smartphones 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.309
 and in five years 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.329
 it is rare that one billion consumers will all be in 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.999
 pro d2 on their mobile finally maurice lÃ©vy said a few months ago 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.740
 the mobile phone this will be the media of the 21st century and I am 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.819

 that's why at this time 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.680
 it will be the modern media of information 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.979
 of a trade 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.719
 in the midst of becoming 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.610
 aliens between buyers' associations and their members 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.799
 and a platform for exchanging between suppliers and their customers 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.410
 a source of information that does not allow buyers to be always at the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.779
 tip of what is done again 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:49.750
 and better 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.240
 on the planet shopping
