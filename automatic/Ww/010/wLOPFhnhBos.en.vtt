00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.910 
wire that you can turn into an ayap in
yourself<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.070> I'll<00:01:02.190> start<00:01:02.609> with

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
yourself so that's what I'll start with

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.820 
yourself so that's what I'll start with
for<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> example<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.140> since<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> wire<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
for this example I since the wire is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.530 
for this example I since the wire is
thin<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> flexible<00:01:08.549> I'm<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
thin and flexible I'm just going to do a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
thin and flexible I'm just going to do a
very<00:01:09.840> simplified<00:01:10.229> plain<00:01:10.770> loop<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.400> end

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
very simplified plain loop at one end

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270 
very simplified plain loop at one end
you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.900> different<00:01:13.740> version<00:01:13.920> which

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you can do a different version which

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
you can do a different version which
I've<00:01:14.490> done<00:01:14.729> another<00:01:15.330> video<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.990> also<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
I've done another video for also on the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.499 
I've done another video for also on the
website<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.759> also<00:01:17.880> covered<00:01:18.240> more

thoroughly in the book if you want more
detail<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.240> I'm<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.659> going

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
detail but for this one I'm just going

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.039 
detail but for this one I'm just going
to<00:01:21.840> bring<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.009> wire<00:01:23.220> around<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.509> tips<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.020> my

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to bring the wire around the tips of my

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.190 
to bring the wire around the tips of my
round<00:01:25.439> nose<00:01:25.560> pliers<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.210> then

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
round nose pliers like this and then

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.499 
round nose pliers like this and then
create<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> bend<00:01:29.130> above<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.360> this

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
create a bend above it so that this

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.490 
create a bend above it so that this
little<00:01:30.810> circle<00:01:32.659> becomes<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.840> eye<00:01:33.990> pin<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
little circle becomes an eye pin like a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.330 
little circle becomes an eye pin like a
little<00:01:34.770> stopper<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.659> earring<00:01:36.960> design<00:01:37.340> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
little stopper for the earring design so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370 
little stopper for the earring design so
the<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.670> thing<00:01:38.880> I'll<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.210> slip<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:40.020> single

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the first thing I'll do is slip a single

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.460 
the first thing I'll do is slip a single
seed<00:01:40.680> bead<00:01:41.600> onto<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.759> plain<00:01:44.759> wire<00:01:45.470> now

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
seed bead onto this plain wire now

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.830 
seed bead onto this plain wire now
you'll<00:01:46.710> add<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.280> focal<00:01:47.820> bead<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.329> anchor<00:01:48.689> B

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you'll add a focal bead like an anchor B

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.740 
you'll add a focal bead like an anchor B
that's<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> main<00:01:49.500> part<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> design<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
that's the main part of the design and

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.310 
that's the main part of the design and
then<00:01:51.750> finally<00:01:52.290> another<00:01:52.590> seed<00:01:53.369> bead<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> have

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
then finally another seed bead so have

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.149 
then finally another seed bead so have
three<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> row<00:01:56.899> let's<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.290> grip<00:01:58.680> right

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
three in a row let's just grip right

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459

mentioned in my book but for this I will

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560 
mentioned in my book but for this I will
just<00:04:19.710> open<00:04:19.920> it<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.450> it's

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
just open it out like this so that it's

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.430 
just open it out like this so that it's
not<00:04:22.040> disrupting<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.190> circular<00:04:23.760> shape<00:04:24.440> slip

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
not disrupting that circular shape slip

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.380 
not disrupting that circular shape slip
the<00:04:25.590> bead<00:04:25.770> angle<00:04:25.950> right<00:04:26.400> onto<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.210> that

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
the bead angle right onto it like that

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.010 
the bead angle right onto it like that
and<00:04:28.400> now<00:04:29.400> repeat<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.270> close<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.750> same

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and now repeat this to close it the same

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.400 
and now repeat this to close it the same
way<00:04:31.260> when<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.400> past<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.300> making<00:04:34.140> sure

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
way when just past and then making sure

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.060 
way when just past and then making sure
it's<00:04:34.560> actually<00:04:35.100> closed<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:39.260> now<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.680> a

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
it's actually closed so now you have a

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.720 
it's actually closed so now you have a
bead<00:04:41.610> dangle<00:04:42.440> like<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.560> pair<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:43.830> solo<00:04:44.160> earrings

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
or you can add it to anything else that

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.880
