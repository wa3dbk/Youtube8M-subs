00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.680 
i'm a huge think tank fan i've used
their<00:00:11.280> gear<00:00:11.519> pretty<00:00:11.759> much<00:00:11.879> since<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.450> came<00:00:12.660> out

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
their gear pretty much since it came out

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.199 
their gear pretty much since it came out

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
shoulder harness I like the shoulder

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.830 
shoulder harness I like the shoulder
harness<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:17.880> i<00:00:17.970> think<00:00:18.030> it<00:00:18.330> distributes

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
harness because i think it distributes

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.740 
harness because i think it distributes
the<00:00:18.960> weight<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.590> more<00:00:19.859> evenly<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:21.359> I'm

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the weight a little more evenly and I'm

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.210 
the weight a little more evenly and I'm
not<00:00:21.900> relying<00:00:22.259> on<00:00:22.410> something<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:22.949> tight

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220

around my hip as you can see this is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.620 
around my hip as you can see this is
pretty<00:00:25.019> loose<00:00:25.789> but<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.089> going<00:00:27.359> into

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
pretty loose but it's not going into

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.329 
pretty loose but it's not going into
work<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> shoulder<00:00:28.589> harness<00:00:28.949> another

is<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:32.250> way<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.430> rotates<00:00:32.940> around<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.450> belt<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
is the way it rotates around the belt so

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.240 
is the way it rotates around the belt so
