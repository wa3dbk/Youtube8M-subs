00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
if you can take a guess this must mean

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.170 
if you can take a guess this must mean
that<00:02:20.210> we<00:02:20.330> can<00:02:20.510> take<00:02:20.690> 5<00:02:21.520> explosive<00:02:22.520> blasts

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180

before<00:02:24.160> losing<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:26.390> know<00:02:26.510> failing<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
before losing the you know failing the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.100 
before losing the you know failing the
boss<00:02:27.530> level<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.700> actually<00:02:29.480> now<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
boss level so actually now that you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.260 
boss level so actually now that you
think<00:02:30.350> about<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.400> actually<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.910> health

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
think about it this is actually a health

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.310 
think about it this is actually a health
meter<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.160> level<00:02:35.320> so

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
meter in the in this for this level so

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.160 
meter in the in this for this level so
perhaps<00:02:36.650> maybe<00:02:37.450> maybe<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.720> helmet<00:02:38.930> was

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
perhaps maybe maybe this helmet was

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.200 
perhaps maybe maybe this helmet was
supposed<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.500> use<00:02:39.740> when<00:02:40.190> you're<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:41.090> know

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
supposed to use when you're you know

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.970 
supposed to use when you're you know
playing<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.540> actual<00:02:41.750> levels<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.560> they<00:02:42.770> took

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
about it so yeah and I'm surprised that

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.790 
about it so yeah and I'm surprised that
the<00:03:31.560> TNT<00:03:32.070> doesn't<00:03:32.400> even<00:03:32.640> set<00:03:32.880> off<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> metal

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
the TNT doesn't even set off the metal

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.570 
the TNT doesn't even set off the metal
explosives<00:03:34.800> here<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.070> there<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:35.460> again

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
explosives here and there but then again

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.640 
explosives here and there but then again
it's<00:03:35.880> made<00:03:36.120> out<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:36.330> metal<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.020> of<00:03:37.170> course<00:03:37.380> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it's made out of metal so of course and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.040 
it's made out of metal so of course and
would<00:03:37.740> set<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.670> off<00:03:38.910> because<00:03:39.120> well<00:03:39.510> metal

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
would set it off because well metal

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.390 
would set it off because well metal
doesn't<00:03:40.260> mean<00:03:40.560> when<00:03:40.710> Susan<00:03:40.980> well<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.190> guess

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
here and there we go that is yet another

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.199 
here and there we go that is yet another
crate<00:03:54.719> taken<00:03:55.079> care<00:03:55.290> of

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.140 

who<00:03:58.599> the<00:03:58.810> timer<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.319> going<00:03:59.500> down<00:03:59.859> much<00:04:00.099> quicker

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
who the timer is going down much quicker

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.360 
who the timer is going down much quicker
as<00:04:01.689> you<00:04:01.930> destroy<00:04:02.140> more<00:04:02.530> crates<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.069> timer

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
as you destroy more crates the timer

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.720 
as you destroy more crates the timer
does<00:04:03.879> go<00:04:04.239> down<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:05.500> know<00:04:05.530> timer<00:04:06.010> set<00:04:06.400> for<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
does go down you know timer set for the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.179 
does go down you know timer set for the

stick of dynamite to blow off is set to
a<00:04:09.220> lower<00:04:09.459> value<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.269> this<00:04:10.510> means<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.959> you

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
a lower value so this means that you

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.410 
a lower value so this means that you
will<00:04:11.920> run<00:04:12.129> into<00:04:12.340> problems<00:04:12.819> if<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.060> can't<00:04:13.269> get

mean so much pain he must have to endure

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.630 
mean so much pain he must have to endure
here<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:10.620> there<00:06:15.830> and<00:06:16.830> now<00:06:17.040> we're<00:06:17.190> in<00:06:17.310> space

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
here and there and now we're in space

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.990 
here and there and now we're in space
and<00:06:18.120> it<00:06:18.630> has<00:06:18.660> some<00:06:19.260> weird<00:06:19.440> textures<00:06:20.010> and<00:06:20.790> an

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
and it has some weird textures and an

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.220 
and it has some weird textures and an
odd<00:06:21.150> skybox

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
odd skybox

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.070 
odd skybox
I<00:06:22.440> guess<00:06:23.100> probably<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.580> save<00:06:23.760> on<00:06:23.970> space<00:06:24.720> on<00:06:24.960> the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
I guess probably to save on space on the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.430 
I guess probably to save on space on the
disk<00:06:25.260> or<00:06:25.530> something<00:06:25.890> I<00:06:25.980> don't<00:06:26.040> know<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:27.440> mean

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
disk or something I don't know I mean

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.580 
disk or something I don't know I mean
this<00:06:28.620> is<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> skybox<00:06:29.160> right<00:06:29.700> here<00:06:30.060> and<00:06:30.350> if<00:06:31.350> you

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
this is a skybox right here and if you

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.340 
this is a skybox right here and if you
look<00:06:32.100> very<00:06:32.280> closely<00:06:32.640> at<00:06:32.970> down<00:06:33.750> there<00:06:34.020> you<00:06:34.140> see

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
look very closely at down there you see

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:45.100 
look very closely at down there you see
some<00:06:34.680> odd<00:06:34.830> textures

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.330 

like<00:06:46.110> a<00:06:46.140> look<00:06:46.320> at<00:06:46.410> this<00:06:46.590> see<00:06:46.920> how<00:06:47.010> it's<00:06:47.160> all
