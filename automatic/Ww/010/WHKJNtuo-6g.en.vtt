00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 this is fox hunter channel hello 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.910
 today talk about the difference between hydro 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.700
 electric power steering on 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.460
 example two mounted power steering 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.539
 the steering wheel in picking the norm for more 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 expensive trim put 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.119
 electric power 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.859
 as well as many others 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.380
 modern cars 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.740
 so what's the difference and what's better i 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.810
 I will try to answer these questions 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.279
 let's start with power steering it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.160
 is a closed system 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.840
 fluid circulation through which 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 steering wheel rotational forces 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 transmitted to the steering shaft due to which and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 steering is easier to turn 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.770
 This is an earlier proven over the years 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 systems yes it has several 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.300
 deficiencies 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.300
 it requires periodic maintenance 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 the temperature is influenced by the hydraulic booster 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.239
 environment and the lower the temperature 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.070
 so much the worse it performs its function 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.030
 also city ​​by rohit engine power 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 even when the steering wheel is motionless and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 Finally, if all of a sudden the tube connections 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.040
 will be damaged 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.090
 and the liquid will start to leave the system this 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.020
 naturally also reduce efficiency 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.610
 facilitate steering wheel rotation 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.350
 Now let's talk about the electric booster 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 steering wheel 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.729
 electric power steering is more 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.549
 modern more simple and at the same time 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.479
 effective design represents 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.229
 electric power out of yourself 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.500
 electric motor with rotation sensors and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:49.020
 when the driver rotates the steering wheel sensor 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.119
 transmits an electric motor; the sensor gives 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 electric signal 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.310
 turned on and facilitated the steering rotation 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.469
 wheels at first glance electro 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.170
 the amplifier has a solid advantage then 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.649
 there is it no difference 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.690
 its temperatures do not need to serve it 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.180
 has a simpler 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:16.190
 design force when turning the steering wheel 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.670
 need to apply less than 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.510
 power that is continuous seemed 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.960
 there would be pluses but there is one big but 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.930
 electric power steering you like 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.330
 feeling empty steering that is reverse 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.080
 connection is expensive and very bad or 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.840
 there is no power steering gives 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.340
 excellent back to your healthy if you 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720
 want to sell a car with 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.330
 power steering 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 from electric power steering you understand about 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.900
 than i say i mean you understand what 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.820
 such an empty role is precisely why 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.460
 power steering 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.620
 still being installed on cars 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.260
 as soon as the engineers are able to solve 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.170
 empty steering problem for 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.360
 electric boosters, I think that the hoops will go 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.360
 in the history of new meetings
