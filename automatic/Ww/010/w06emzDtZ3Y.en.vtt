00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
yet to be built maybe it's just because

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you're off a little better to leave the

you're off a little better to leave the
Eyrie<00:01:25.680> obvious<00:01:27.140> here

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
Eyrie obvious here

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.779 
Eyrie obvious here
you<00:01:30.560> know<00:01:30.680> kind<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.100> variation<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.700> that

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
you know kind of a variation of that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.149 
you know kind of a variation of that
color<00:01:32.390> here<00:01:32.869> with<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.079> little<00:01:33.409> bit<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.649> blue<00:01:33.799> in

color here with a little bit of blue in
a<00:01:35.000> little<00:01:35.240> bit<00:01:35.359> of<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.750> darker<00:01:36.530> areas<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.070> dry

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
a little bit of the darker areas to dry

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.080 
a little bit of the darker areas to dry
first<00:01:37.700> before<00:01:37.969> you<00:01:38.240> approach<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.850> again

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
first before you approach that and again

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.090 
first before you approach that and again
remember<00:01:41.210> we're<00:01:41.570> going<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.750> let<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:42.200> lot<00:01:42.799> of<00:01:42.950> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
remember we're going to let a lot of the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.399 
remember we're going to let a lot of the
ink<00:01:43.310> do<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.210> work<00:01:44.390> for<00:01:44.630> us<00:01:44.689> when<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.109> get<00:01:45.259> to

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
ink do the work for us when we get to

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.539 
ink do the work for us when we get to
that<00:01:45.530> part<00:01:45.829> when<00:01:46.100> we<00:01:46.130> start<00:01:46.460> doing<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> drill

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
that part when we start doing the drill

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.069 
that part when we start doing the drill
probably<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.579> flatter<00:01:50.030> brush<00:01:50.360> might<00:01:50.840> do<00:01:51.049> a

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
probably a flatter brush might do a

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.660 
probably a flatter brush might do a
better<00:01:51.259> job<00:01:51.409> here<00:01:53.049> but<00:01:54.049> for<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.890> areas<00:01:55.640> that

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
better job here but for the areas that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.649 
better job here but for the areas that
we<00:01:55.990> already<00:01:56.990> put<00:01:57.289> down<00:01:57.759> some<00:01:58.759> brick<00:01:59.000> texture

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.770 

super<00:02:02.659> detail<00:02:03.049> with<00:02:03.229> anything<00:02:04.569> again<00:02:05.569> because

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
super detail with anything again because

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.490 
super detail with anything again because
we're<00:02:05.959> creating<00:02:06.110> an<00:02:06.439> illusion<00:02:07.869> all<00:02:08.869> right

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
we're creating an illusion all right

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.380 
we're creating an illusion all right
now<00:02:10.369> I'm<00:02:10.459> gonna<00:02:10.579> go<00:02:10.789> ahead<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.150> address

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
now I'm gonna go ahead and address

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.490 
now I'm gonna go ahead and address
Azazel<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.739> should<00:02:12.950> say<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.750> again<00:02:15.019> let<00:02:15.200> some<00:02:15.410> of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
Azazel I should say so again let some of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.130 
Azazel I should say so again let some of
the<00:02:15.560> texture<00:02:15.980> happen<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.880> your<00:02:17.060> brush<00:02:17.329> when

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the texture happen with your brush when

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.680 
the texture happen with your brush when
you're<00:02:18.260> putting<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> marks<00:02:18.829> down<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:20.420> top<00:02:20.660> of

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you're putting the marks down on top of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.100 
you're putting the marks down on top of
the<00:02:20.930> marks<00:02:21.200> you've<00:02:21.500> already<00:02:21.620> put<00:02:21.890> down<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the marks you've already put down you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.690 
the marks you've already put down you
kind<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.319> want<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.530> pull<00:02:24.799> those<00:02:24.980> branches<00:02:25.370> out

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.040 
all right with that I'm going to say
that<00:02:37.640> texture<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.819> indicate<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.450> leaves<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
that texture to indicate the leaves and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.570 
that texture to indicate the leaves and
if<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.260> start<00:02:40.530> doing<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.069> dark<00:02:41.340> here

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
if we start doing this in the dark here

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.520 
if we start doing this in the dark here
yeah<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:42.420> really<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> little<00:02:43.200> bit<00:02:43.349> more

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
control the the texture that I'm making

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.710 
control the the texture that I'm making
just<00:02:47.340> kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> put<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.030> your<00:02:48.150> name<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.569> you

perfectly straight make them kind of
some<00:03:18.329> detailed<00:03:18.780> marks<00:03:20.030> little<00:03:21.030> goes<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> long

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
some detailed marks little goes a long

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.470 
some detailed marks little goes a long
way<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.549> mistake<00:03:23.549> comes<00:03:23.880> when<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.239> try<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
put just the windowsills kind of painted

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.280 
put just the windowsills kind of painted
these<00:03:31.560> bonds<00:03:32.099> out<00:03:32.310> last<00:03:32.640> week<00:03:33.000> have<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.019> fit

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
these bonds out last week have to fit

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.000 
these bonds out last week have to fit
exactly<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:35.989> what<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.170> painted<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.829> can

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
plant life that's a little further away

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.680 
plant life that's a little further away
off<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.190> distance<00:03:59.459> there<00:03:59.970> behind<00:04:00.359> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
watercolor paint is doing so I'm going

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.300 
watercolor paint is doing so I'm going
to<00:04:09.750> kind<00:04:10.019> of<00:04:10.079> put<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.319> little<00:04:10.470> bit<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:10.980> tree

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
to kind of put a little bit of the tree

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:26.710 
to kind of put a little bit of the tree
texture

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.750 

just<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.410> little<00:04:27.680> bit<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.890> an<00:04:27.980> indication<00:04:28.280> of

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
just a little bit of an indication of

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.970 
just a little bit of an indication of
contrast<00:04:29.390> between<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.840> bottom<00:04:30.170> of<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.440> fifth
