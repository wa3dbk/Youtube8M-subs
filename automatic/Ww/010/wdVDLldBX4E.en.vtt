00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
ridiculous haste breakpoint so my point

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.770 
ridiculous haste breakpoint so my point
is<00:02:26.550> o<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.740> are

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
is o all of this is that if you are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.610 
is o all of this is that if you are
around<00:02:30.780> say<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.230> five<00:02:31.770> sixty<00:02:32.700> five<00:02:33.510> fifty<00:02:34.260> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
around say the five sixty five fifty I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.970 
around say the five sixty five fifty I
would<00:02:34.980> say<00:02:35.070> five<00:02:35.280> fifty<00:02:35.670> minimum<00:02:36.650> by<00:02:37.650> level

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
would say five fifty minimum by level

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.060

amazed and I'll probably give you a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.070 
amazed and I'll probably give you a
medal<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.959> cookie<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.940> at<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> same<00:04:18.810> time

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
medal and a cookie but at the same time

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.110 
medal and a cookie but at the same time
if<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:20.400> are<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.580> little<00:04:20.760> over<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:21.390> okay

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
if you are a little over that's okay

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.210 
if you are a little over that's okay
I've<00:04:22.449> this<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.229> closest<00:04:23.650> I've<00:04:23.800> been<00:04:23.830> in

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
I've this is the closest I've been in

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.129 
I've this is the closest I've been in
forever<00:04:24.610> just<00:04:25.210> because<00:04:25.389> when<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.810> get<00:04:25.960> that

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
forever just because when you get that

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.659 
forever just because when you get that
high<00:04:26.380> it's<00:04:26.620> really<00:04:26.949> hard<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.250> hit<00:04:27.370> right<00:04:27.550> on

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
high it's really hard to hit right on

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.680 
high it's really hard to hit right on
the<00:04:27.790> money<00:04:28.050> other<00:04:29.070> otherwise<00:04:30.070> if<00:04:30.510> once<00:04:31.510> you're

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
the money other otherwise if once you're

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.570 
the money other otherwise if once you're
done<00:04:31.840> Gemma<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.530> still<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.310> and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
done Gemma and you still have and and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.780 
done Gemma and you still have and and
you're<00:04:33.729> like<00:04:33.760> way<00:04:34.419> over<00:04:34.840> then<00:04:35.470> reforge<00:04:36.280> out<00:04:36.550> of

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
you're like way over then reforge out of

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.670 
you're like way over then reforge out of
the<00:04:36.910> haste<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.449> some<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.960> gear<00:04:38.229> just

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the haste on some of the gear just

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.980 
the haste on some of the gear just
because<00:04:38.889> it's<00:04:39.070> easier<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.720> that's<00:04:40.720> probably

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
because it's easier and that's probably

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.909 
because it's easier and that's probably
the<00:04:41.350> way<00:04:41.470> you'll<00:04:41.650> go<00:04:43.680> otherwise<00:04:44.680> yeah<00:04:46.770> yeah<00:04:47.770> as

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
the way you'll go otherwise yeah yeah as

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.430 
the way you'll go otherwise yeah yeah as
you<00:04:48.040> can<00:04:48.100> see<00:04:48.190> most<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.550> my<00:04:48.639> stuff<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:48.970> haste

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
you can see most of my stuff is haste

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.930 
you can see most of my stuff is haste
pretty<00:04:50.440> much<00:04:50.560> all<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.889> is<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.310> then<00:04:51.639> I<00:04:51.669> just

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
pretty much all of it is and then I just

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.480 
pretty much all of it is and then I just
gem<00:04:52.300> for<00:04:53.139> it<00:04:53.260> and<00:04:53.470> then<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.070> stuff<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:54.460> I

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
gem for it and then the stuff that I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.180 
gem for it and then the stuff that I
didn't<00:04:54.820> need<00:04:54.970> Gen<00:04:55.960> taste<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.440> went<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.710> mastery

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
didn't need Gen taste I went to mastery

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.950 
didn't need Gen taste I went to mastery
so<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:57.910> actually<00:04:58.120> have<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.389> decent<00:04:58.570> amount<00:04:58.900> of
