00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.630 

I've<00:00:00.329> been<00:00:00.690> thinking<00:00:01.110> about<00:00:01.410> doing<00:00:02.449> something

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
I've been thinking about doing something

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.270 
I've been thinking about doing something
whether<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.850> was<00:00:06.060> filler<00:00:06.509> or<00:00:08.150> maybe<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.300> little

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
whether it was filler or maybe a little

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.930 
whether it was filler or maybe a little
brow<00:00:11.280> lift<00:00:11.820> something<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:13.460> started<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:14.759> a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.779 
brow lift something I started to see a
change<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.560> last<00:00:16.770> two<00:00:17.039> or<00:00:17.070> three<00:00:17.250> years<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
change in the last two or three years I

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.950 
change in the last two or three years I
wanted<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.119> wanted<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:24.240> gain<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.720> years

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380 

Greece<00:00:35.380> was<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.950> first<00:00:36.250> big<00:00:36.700> break<00:00:36.970> I<00:00:37.180> think

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
Greece was the first big break I think

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.340 
Greece was the first big break I think
that<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.870> got<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.520> my<00:00:40.330> world<00:00:40.630> didn't<00:00:41.050> change

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
that I I got but my world didn't change

then<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:47.870> couldn't<00:00:48.380> walk<00:00:48.530> down<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.920> street

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
then I couldn't walk down the street

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.910

unless you know people would they would

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.980 
unless you know people would they would
stop<00:00:52.190> me<00:00:52.370> from<00:00:52.400> autographs<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.270> pictures<00:00:53.480> it

had a great great connection the type of
work<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.740> do<00:01:05.860> involves<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.820> lot<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.060> people

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
work that I do involves a lot of people

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.060 
work that I do involves a lot of people
in<00:01:07.659> entertainment<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> lot<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.560> celebrities

my hands and I was always artistic my
mother<00:01:23.560> was<00:01:23.770> an<00:01:23.920> artist<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:24.369> my<00:01:24.430> father<00:01:24.670> was<00:01:24.909> a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
surgeon so that's kind of what led me

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.560 
surgeon so that's kind of what led me
into<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.100> field<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.430> plastic<00:01:27.580> surgery<00:01:27.789> with

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
into the field of plastic surgery with

into the field of plastic surgery with
Lorenzo<00:01:29.110> I'm<00:01:29.289> gonna<00:01:29.440> do<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.680> mini<00:01:30.100> facelift<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.160 
know he doesn't have that much extra
skin<00:01:33.159> but<00:01:34.060> he's<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> good<00:01:34.539> candidate<00:01:34.929> for<00:01:34.990> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
skin but he's a good candidate for the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.540 
skin but he's a good candidate for the
type<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.380> facelift<00:01:35.920> procedure<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.369> I<00:01:36.429> do

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
type of facelift procedure that I do

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.340 
type of facelift procedure that I do
which<00:01:36.850> involves<00:01:37.270> lifting<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.840> deeper<00:01:38.170> layers

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
which involves lifting the deeper layers

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.830 
which involves lifting the deeper layers
of<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.679> face<00:01:38.860> harmonic<00:01:39.550> technology<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.420> an

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
of the face harmonic technology is an

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.350 
of the face harmonic technology is an
ultrasonic<00:01:41.409> technology<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.369> allows<00:01:42.640> me<00:01:43.060> to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
ultrasonic technology that allows me to

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300 
ultrasonic technology that allows me to
separate<00:01:43.899> tissues<00:01:44.380> with<00:01:44.560> ultrasound<00:01:45.130> as

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
separate tissues with ultrasound as

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.859 
separate tissues with ultrasound as
opposed<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.729> heat<00:01:46.000> or<00:01:46.149> cautery

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
opposed to heat or cautery

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.540 
opposed to heat or cautery
it's<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.229> bloodless<00:01:47.649> type<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.039> surgery<00:01:48.399> and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
it's a bloodless type of surgery and

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.520 
it's a bloodless type of surgery and
what<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.850> means<00:01:49.060> for<00:01:49.390> me<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.350> get<00:01:50.500> to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
what that means for me is that I get to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.529 
what that means for me is that I get to
see<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.890> anatomy<00:01:51.100> much<00:01:51.490> better<00:01:51.759> what<00:01:52.450> it

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
see the anatomy much better what it

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.910 
see the anatomy much better what it
means<00:01:52.690> for<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.899> patient<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
means for the patient is that the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.980 
means for the patient is that the
recovery<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.399> quicker<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:55.119> we<00:01:55.240> can<00:01:55.390> do<00:01:55.509> facial

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
recovery is quicker so we can do facial

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.260 
recovery is quicker so we can do facial
surgery<00:01:56.350> facelifts<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.190> have<00:01:57.729> them<00:01:57.880> get<00:01:58.090> back

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
surgery facelifts and have them get back

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.999 
surgery facelifts and have them get back
on<00:01:58.569> camera<00:01:58.840> within<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.259> couple<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.619> weeks<00:01:59.740> in<00:01:59.950> a

yeah it's a big difference between a
chiral<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.290> little<00:02:11.890> bit<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.190> like<00:02:12.400> subtle

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
chiral a little bit of like subtle

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.400 
chiral a little bit of like subtle
swelling<00:02:13.270> especially<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:13.959> right<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.379> I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
swelling especially like right here I

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.740 
swelling especially like right here I
think<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.940> will<00:02:16.120> come<00:02:16.270> down<00:02:16.330> nicely

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
think but that will come down nicely

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.990 
think but that will come down nicely
things<00:02:17.530> were<00:02:17.739> pretty<00:02:17.980> much<00:02:18.129> as<00:02:18.310> expected<00:02:18.340> with

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
things were pretty much as expected with

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
things were pretty much as expected with
Lorenzo<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.810> fact<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.170> Lorenzo<00:02:20.830> had<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
Lorenzo the fact that Lorenzo had a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.680 
Lorenzo the fact that Lorenzo had a
quick<00:02:21.220> recovery<00:02:21.489> has<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.270> with<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
quick recovery has to do with the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.720 
quick recovery has to do with the
harmonic<00:02:23.319> scalpel<00:02:23.560> there's<00:02:24.129> just<00:02:24.340> not<00:02:24.550> as

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
harmonic scalpel there's just not as

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.970 
harmonic scalpel there's just not as
much<00:02:24.970> trauma<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> tissues<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.560> allows<00:02:26.830> me

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
much trauma to the tissues it allows me

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.619 
much trauma to the tissues it allows me
to<00:02:27.099> cut<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.520> ultrasound<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.209> do<00:02:28.330> some

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
to cut with ultrasound and do some

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.110 
to cut with ultrasound and do some
fairly<00:02:29.080> complex<00:02:29.560> anatomic<00:02:30.220> repositioning<00:02:30.970> of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
fairly complex anatomic repositioning of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.820 
fairly complex anatomic repositioning of
deeper<00:02:31.450> tissues<00:02:31.840> which<00:02:32.349> gives<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> more

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
deeper tissues which gives you a more

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.650 
deeper tissues which gives you a more
natural<00:02:33.250> result<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.030> he's<00:02:34.150> back<00:02:34.360> already

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
natural result and he's back already

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.780 
natural result and he's back already
doing<00:02:35.080> sitcoms<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.680> things<00:02:35.830> like<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.459> it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
doing sitcoms and things like that so it

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940 
doing sitcoms and things like that so it
does<00:02:36.940> speed<00:02:37.150> things<00:02:37.360> up<00:02:37.540> well<00:02:38.260> after<00:02:38.500> all<00:02:38.800> a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
does speed things up well after all a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.990 
does speed things up well after all a
sudden<00:02:39.340> done<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.080> still<00:02:41.080> look<00:02:41.319> like<00:02:41.349> myself

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
sudden done I still look like myself

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.460 
sudden done I still look like myself
which<00:02:43.000> i<00:02:43.330> think<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.840> something<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.200> goes

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
which i think is something that goes

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.100 
which i think is something that goes
through<00:02:44.739> everybody's<00:02:45.550> mind<00:02:45.580> before<00:02:46.269> they<00:02:47.050> do

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
through everybody's mind before they do

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.650 
through everybody's mind before they do
a<00:02:47.230> procedure<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.800> this<00:02:48.120> one<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.360> unique
