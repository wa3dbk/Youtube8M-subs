I've<00:00:25.949> got<00:00:26.189> two<00:00:26.340> branches<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.420> my<00:00:27.720> left<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
I've got two branches on my left here is

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.800 
I've got two branches on my left here is
one<00:00:29.039> normal<00:00:29.699> leaf<00:00:29.880> cards<00:00:30.210> nice<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.630> dark

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
one normal leaf cards nice and dark

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.860 
one normal leaf cards nice and dark
green<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.520> chlorosis

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
green on the right is one with chlorosis

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.270 
green on the right is one with chlorosis
see<00:00:33.870> how<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.350> leaves<00:00:34.770> turning<00:00:35.010> yellow

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
see how the the leaves turning yellow

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.680 
see how the the leaves turning yellow
and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> veins<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:35.940> staying<00:00:36.210> dark<00:00:36.420> green

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and the veins are staying dark green

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
and the veins are staying dark green
that's<00:00:37.440> probably<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> first<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.430> second

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that's probably the first or second

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990 
that's probably the first or second
stage<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> chlorosis<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> easy<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> treat

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
stage of chlorosis this is easy to treat

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
stage of chlorosis this is easy to treat
when<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> gets<00:00:42.690> much<00:00:42.899> worse<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.410> gets<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> be

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
when it gets much worse it gets to be

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.479 
when it gets much worse it gets to be
very<00:00:43.829> hard<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:45.059> maple<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.629> treat<00:00:45.840> manganese

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
very hard on a maple we treat manganese

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.540 
very hard on a maple we treat manganese
or<00:00:47.489> soil<00:00:48.300> sulfur<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.680> use<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:49.950> implant<00:00:50.340> or

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.920 

it<00:02:43.220> shows<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> front<00:02:44.180> of<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.300> package

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
it shows it on the front of the package

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.160 
it shows it on the front of the package
having<00:02:45.710> implanted

it's important to the head the implant
goes<00:02:49.720> under<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.170> bark<00:02:50.380> yes<00:02:51.340> we've<00:02:51.550> got<00:02:51.580> here

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
goes under the bark yes we've got here

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.330 
goes under the bark yes we've got here
then<00:02:52.900> we'll<00:02:53.020> draw<00:02:53.200> another<00:02:53.440> huh<00:02:53.920> four<00:02:54.220> inches

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
then we'll draw another huh four inches

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:18.140 
then we'll draw another huh four inches
over<00:02:55.230> three<00:02:59.670> cyril<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:03.130> up<00:03:03.250> weaken<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> train

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.160 

we'll<00:03:19.150> put<00:03:19.330> one<00:03:19.480> more<00:03:19.600> cap<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.080> here<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.990> we'll

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
we'll put one more cap in here and we'll

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.460 
we'll put one more cap in here and we'll
set<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.470> right<00:03:23.620> depth<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.810> then<00:03:26.380> we'll

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
set it the right depth and then we'll

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.190 
set it the right depth and then we'll
work<00:03:26.620> our<00:03:26.770> way<00:03:26.860> around<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.430> trunk<00:03:31.080> go<00:03:32.080> to

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
work our way around this trunk go to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.380 
work our way around this trunk go to
spiral<00:03:32.770> all<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.040> way<00:03:33.160> around<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.489> tree<00:03:33.730> you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
spiral all the way around the tree you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.070 
spiral all the way around the tree you
don't<00:03:34.600> reel<00:03:34.780> circle

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
don't reel circle

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.410 
don't reel circle
then<00:03:36.680> set<00:03:37.490> up<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.700> sprinkler<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.120> you're<00:03:38.300> good

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
then set up a sprinkler and you're good

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.420 
then set up a sprinkler and you're good
to<00:03:38.540> go<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:39.230> IRB<00:03:39.500> pulled<00:03:39.770> up<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.980> tree<00:03:40.220> and

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
to go the IRB pulled up the tree and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.059 
to go the IRB pulled up the tree and
take<00:03:40.820> care<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.120> it

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
take care of it

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.429 
take care of it
