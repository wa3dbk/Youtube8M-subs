one<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.360> solution<00:03:27.810> excellent<00:03:28.350> we<00:03:28.470> would

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
one of the solution excellent we would

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.610 
one of the solution excellent we would
be<00:03:28.830> dead<00:03:28.980> take<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.640> back<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.030> season<00:03:30.620> yes

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
be dead take the back of the season yes

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.240 
be dead take the back of the season yes
and<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.910> part<00:03:33.240> right<00:03:33.300> where<00:03:34.220> did<00:03:35.220> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and so this part right where did you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.440 
and so this part right where did you
come<00:03:35.970> from<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.120> take<00:03:39.300> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
come from like that so you just take the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.510 
come from like that so you just take the
very<00:03:39.630> opposite<00:03:39.990> say<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:41.360> kept<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.510> down

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
very opposite say we just kept it down

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.400 
very opposite say we just kept it down
