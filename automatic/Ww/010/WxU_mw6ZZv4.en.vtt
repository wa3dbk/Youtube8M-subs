that that community has grown and I much

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
that that community has grown and I much
how<00:00:16.320> much<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.710> staple<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.460> culture<00:00:17.789> now

how much of a staple is in culture now
oh<00:00:18.230> I<00:00:19.230> think<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> certain<00:00:22.740> extent<00:00:23.300> it's<00:00:24.300> been

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
oh I think to a certain extent it's been

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.910 
oh I think to a certain extent it's been
positive<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.170> because<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> some<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
positive but I think because of some of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.900 
positive but I think because of some of
the<00:00:25.980> stuff<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.189> happens<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the stuff that happens that some of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
the stuff that happens that some of
those<00:00:27.000> can't<00:00:27.210> around<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.570> people<00:00:27.689> like

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
those can't around some people like

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
those can't around some people like
busting<00:00:28.380> windows<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.010> people<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.519> nuts<00:00:29.760> um

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
busting windows and people going nuts um

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
busting windows and people going nuts um
but<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> don't<00:00:30.960> think<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.470> much<00:00:31.679> that's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
but I don't think that's so much that's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970 
but I don't think that's so much that's
not<00:00:32.719> nike<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.140> sneaker<00:00:34.469> its<00:00:34.620> communities
