00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:32.300
 welcome greeted well 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.610
 you both look beautiful today 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.690
 celebrate this day together with you 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.120
 allowed 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.260
 and I want to invite you to witness 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.840
 how both run the ceremony that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.600
 yes-word will give 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.310
 You two are about six years old 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 together and there you will experience too 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.410
 some but it took a while 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.270
 and today you want one more step 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.880
 go on and I think that's what 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.040
 is very big and we are happy 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.040
 Just look at what is still full 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.500
 then they will put this sand together in 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.000
 tilt this tube and that should be easy 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 emphasize you both are 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 differently 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.440
 still become a unit 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 there 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.670
 It looks and should look beautiful 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.690
 just like a reminder 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.020
 you strengthen your spirits yours 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 have put together in order to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.770
 a direction to look and I think 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.540
 that's really something special 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.390
 do not want to go through life alone 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.320
 but want to make a decision 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.020
 be traveling as a couple together 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.270
 it's like that with love 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.549
 we can not always put them in words 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.369
 yes, it is a bit far that way 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.060
 she takes possession of us 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.849
 us she captures us and i would say 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.010
 Love is the strongest emotion in the world 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.230
 universe there is nothing more powerful 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.599
 Love both loves it together 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.689
 for example, some nice concerts 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.239
 to visit or musicals or times 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.849
 to go to the cinema together 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.439
 to meet friends or a cooking class 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.310
 to visit there you are totally 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.849
 creative 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.069
 There is so much you like so much 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.690
 do together 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 you are flexible and spontaneous you are 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.549
 also very outgoing 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.250
 you are very diligent and ambitious person 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.180
 itself very supportive reliable 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.409
 These are really beautiful arguments 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.810
 beautiful arguments that you both 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:04.770
 I sit here today , I still wonder 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.640
 These arguments are the real reason 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.710
 she sits here today 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.750
 I would like to make it concrete again 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.470
 In short, there are also times 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.510
 disillusionment 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.030
 there are moments where you can recognize the moment 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.470
 others also have their corners and 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.900
 edge 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.329
 What if it does not go so well? 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.280
 what if that is not the case anymore 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.630
 who likes to be 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.190
 what's the point of humor once 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.700
 What if illness or other 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.290
 Do not let crises be what we like
