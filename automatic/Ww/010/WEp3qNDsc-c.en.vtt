00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
keeping the color light was really

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.600

the only color in the house that isn't
anywhere<00:05:14.480> else<00:05:14.690> it<00:05:15.290> helps<00:05:15.620> keep<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:15.770> real

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
walking up stairs and it doesn't really

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.090 
walking up stairs and it doesn't really
