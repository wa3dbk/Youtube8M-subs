a<00:01:10.080> zombie<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a zombie I think but you can see this is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
a zombie I think but you can see this is
the<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.189> phase<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> series<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the first phase was down the series and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
the first phase was down the series and
now<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> second<00:01:15.960> phase<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.530> go<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:16.920> man

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
now the second phase you go up man

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.090 
now the second phase you go up man
cannon<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:18.090> spawns<00:01:18.479> after<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.680> minute<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cannon which spawns after one minute of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.730 
cannon which spawns after one minute of
in-game<00:01:20.939> time<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.110> three<00:01:22.590> minutes

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
in-game time or right on three minutes

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
in-game time or right on three minutes
if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.850> looking<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.509> game<00:01:24.750> clock

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
if you are looking at the game clock

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
if you are looking at the game clock
when<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.409> playing<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
when you're actually playing it this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
when you're actually playing it this
area<00:01:27.240> has<00:01:27.869> been<00:01:28.200> changed<00:01:28.740> drastically<00:01:29.189> quite

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
area has been changed drastically quite

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
area has been changed drastically quite
a<00:01:30.000> few<00:01:30.240> times<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.079> i<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.619> works

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
a few times but i think this one works

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
a few times but i think this one works
out<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> best<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.420> really

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
out the best it was kind of really

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
out the best it was kind of really
really<00:01:34.530> hard<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.920> survive<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> human<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.240> i

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
really hard to survive as a human but i

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.240 
really hard to survive as a human but i
changed<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.110> took<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.680> some<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> cover

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
changed it up took out some of the cover

hard<00:01:45.270> either<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.720> i<00:01:45.750> tried<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> find<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> nice

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
hard either so i tried to find a nice

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
hard either so i tried to find a nice
balance<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.340> after<00:01:47.670> another<00:01:48.090> minute<00:01:48.450> when

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
balance so after another minute when

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
balance so after another minute when
you're<00:01:48.990> defending<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.619> second<00:01:50.070> area<00:01:50.280> then

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
you're defending the second area then

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.020 
you're defending the second area then
this<00:01:51.030> grid<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:51.960> spawn<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:53.490> grid<00:01:53.729> looks

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
this grid will spawn and the grid looks

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
this grid will spawn and the grid looks
like<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.420> light<00:01:54.659> bridge<00:01:54.930> which<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.290> kind<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
like a light bridge which is kind of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
like a light bridge which is kind of
cool<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.159> remember<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.479> know

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
cool if you remember in like you know

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
cool if you remember in like you know
halo<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.110> driving<00:01:58.469> across<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> warthog

or<00:01:59.930> anything<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.670> hopefully

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
or anything like that then hopefully

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.709 
or anything like that then hopefully
it's<00:02:02.790> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> cool-looking<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.420> thought<00:02:03.630> it

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
it's kind of cool-looking I thought it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
it's kind of cool-looking I thought it
was<00:02:03.869> I've<00:02:04.320> never<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.799> seen<00:02:05.100> anybody<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729

up with that DOMA yeah I'll get over it

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.890 
up with that DOMA yeah I'll get over it
anyway<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.590> first<00:03:17.859> area<00:03:18.690> defending<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.780> this

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
anyway this first area defending in this

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.870 
anyway this first area defending in this
elbow<00:03:20.290> over<00:03:20.650> here<00:03:20.829> that's<00:03:20.980> what<00:03:21.639> I've<00:03:21.730> been

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
elbow over here that's what I've been

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.490 
elbow over here that's what I've been
calling<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.329> is<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.870> elbow<00:03:23.169> it's<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.380> nice

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
calling it is the elbow it's a nice

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.770 
calling it is the elbow it's a nice
little<00:03:23.620> 90<00:03:24.040> degree<00:03:24.310> angle<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:24.760> then<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.569> can

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
little 90 degree angle and then you can

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.909 
little 90 degree angle and then you can
or<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.200> only<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.680> worry<00:03:26.799> about

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
or you only have to worry about

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.979 
or you only have to worry about
defending<00:03:27.340> from<00:03:27.579> two<00:03:27.970> ways<00:03:28.239> but<00:03:28.660> if<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.840> run

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
defending from two ways but if you run

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.509 
defending from two ways but if you run
up<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.200> where<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.410> bubble<00:03:29.739> shield<00:03:29.919> is<00:03:30.250> and

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
up to where that bubble shield is and

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.339 
up to where that bubble shield is and
where<00:03:30.609> that<00:03:30.760> man<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.120> adjust<00:03:31.389> spawned<00:03:31.599> you

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
where that man can adjust spawned you

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.440 
where that man can adjust spawned you
have<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.530> defend<00:03:32.769> from<00:03:33.010> three<00:03:33.430> ways<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.329> is

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
have to defend from three ways so it is

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.809 
have to defend from three ways so it is
a<00:03:34.480> little<00:03:34.750> bit<00:03:34.900> easier<00:03:35.139> if<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.829> sit<00:03:36.549> back<00:03:36.669> in

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
a little bit easier if you sit back in

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.220 
a little bit easier if you sit back in
the<00:03:36.849> elbow<00:03:37.239> but<00:03:37.450> then<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.690> do<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.079> make<00:03:38.109> a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the elbow but then you do have to make a

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.210 
the elbow but then you do have to make a
run<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:39.099> get<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.750> get<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.139> man<00:03:41.319> cannon<00:03:41.680> so

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
run to get to get to the man cannon so

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.780 
run to get to get to the man cannon so
it<00:03:42.669> is<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.769> better<00:03:44.769> place<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.130> hold<00:03:45.280> up<00:03:45.400> but<00:03:45.609> you

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
it is a better place to hold up but you

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.849 
it is a better place to hold up but you
have<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.060> travel<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.389> little<00:03:46.450> further<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.859> make

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
have to travel a little further to make

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.159 
have to travel a little further to make
sure<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.069> get<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.310> next<00:03:48.430> area<00:03:49.169> this

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
sure you get to the next area this

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.539

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
in the zombie spawn at the teleporters

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.350 
in the zombie spawn at the teleporters
if<00:04:23.980> especially<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.640> few<00:04:24.850> mins<00:04:25.000> have<00:04:25.150> already

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
it's not too big of a deal because it

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.690 
it's not too big of a deal because it
flickers<00:04:29.920> for<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.130> second<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:30.490> take<00:04:30.640> a

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
flickers for a second you take a

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.920 
flickers for a second you take a
teleporter<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.240> then<00:04:31.390> it's<00:04:31.510> fine<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:32.760> yeah

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
teleporter and then it's fine so yeah

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.360 
teleporter and then it's fine so yeah
people<00:04:34.930> do<00:04:35.140> complain<00:04:35.500> about<00:04:35.650> flickering<00:04:36.190> and
