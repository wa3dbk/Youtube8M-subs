00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.100
 maximum common divisor algorithm 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.100
 Euclid 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.230
 when you want to calculate the maximum common 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:23.850
 divisor of large numbers like 364 and 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:28.950
 748 the euclid algorithm is used 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.780
 what is to choose the largest of two 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:38.430
 numbers 748 in this case and divide it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.600
 between the lesser of both numbers 364 in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.289
 this case 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.140
 students are expected to divide 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:49.510
 natural numbers if not enter 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 to dotcom math videos for 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.460
 learn how a division is made 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.180
 if you choose three digits because the divisor 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 has three figures then 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.520
 you look for a number that multiplied by 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.090
 3 result 7 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.329
 the number multiplied by three is equal 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.580
 to 7 or close to 7 the answer is 2 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:21.110
 because 2 by 3 6 and 6 is very close to 7 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.020
 you start multiplying 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:34.910
 by the first number on the right 2 by 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:40.330
 48 to 80 2 to 6 12 to 14 22 to 36 and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:45.770
 one that carried the 14 7 to the 70 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:51.850
 as the residue was not zero then 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.850
 divide the divider between the residue 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.900
 this time do not take three figures 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.900
 because the divisor has only two figures 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.120
 and by taking the first two figures 36 it 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.340
 has that 36 is less than 20 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.610
 so only two figures are taken up 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.430
 here 36 divided by 20 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.480
 then that number x 2 will be equal to 3 or 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.510
 close to 3 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:29.739
 2 for 1 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:32.930
 2 for 1 2 to 3 12 for 12 closest to 3 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:38.409
 but it starts multiplying by the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:43.970
 first number on the right 1 by 0 0 at 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:47.000
 661 for 22 to 31 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.470
 and then the next figure is downloaded 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.010
 and now it is analyzed 16 in relation to 2 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.720
 that is, the number x 2 approaches 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:07.960
 16 o is equal to 16 the answer is 8 8 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:12.670
 by 0 0 to 4 48 by 2 16 to 16 0 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:17.490
 As the residue was not zero, the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.490
 divider between the residue 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.870
 what number multiplied by four is 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:33.830
 equal to 20 or approaches 20 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.830
 the answer is 55 by 4 20 to 20 0 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.879
 now the residue was zero when the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.750
 residue is zero the exercise ends and 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:50.180
 the divisor becomes the common maximum 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:55.129
 Divider 4 is the greatest common divisor of 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.129
 364 and 748 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.040
 for a clearer understanding of this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.280
 video we recommend that once 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.290
 come to this point again to see another 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.030
 time the video all the procedure that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.740
 it has been explained 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.700
 after having seen 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.300
 again the video for the second time 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.200
 try to perform this same exercise 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.680
 without watching the video 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.040
 pause the video and do it again 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.960
 this same exercise on a paper without 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.630
 look at the procedure 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.039
 and if you have difficulty doing it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.930
 then see once again the steps that 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.810
 explain in this video 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.090
 later in this video they are presented 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.080
 other exercises for you to follow 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.080
 practicing but before we remind you that 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.780
 do not forget to share this video with 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.420
 your mates with your friends with your 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.510
 students 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.050
 leave your comment if you have questions or 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.120
 indicate what you thought of the video 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.210
 rate the video indicating if you liked it 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.780
 or you did not like it now you have to practice 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.500
 find the greatest common divisor of each 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.500
 pair of numbers 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.139
 here are the results
