00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
contraction of the movements at the top

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.550 
contraction of the movements at the top
all<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.000> time<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.540> don't<00:01:19.720> do<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.110> go<00:01:20.230> all<00:01:20.410> the

to feel the stretch okay

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.170 
to feel the stretch okay
here<00:01:24.160> you'll<00:01:24.310> find<00:01:24.340> your<00:01:24.760> range<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.120> motion

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
here you'll find your range of motion

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.730 
here you'll find your range of motion
okay<00:01:25.990> some<00:01:26.229> people<00:01:26.560> aren't<00:01:26.890> as<00:01:27.010> limber<00:01:27.310> to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
okay some people aren't as limber to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.300 
okay some people aren't as limber to
develop<00:01:34.500> okay<00:01:35.500> just<00:01:36.160> take<00:01:36.280> us<00:01:36.460> through<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
develop okay just take us through that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.760 
develop okay just take us through that
so<00:01:39.310> keep<00:01:39.880> basically<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.320> construction

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
so keep basically that the construction

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.830 
so keep basically that the construction
of<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.040> top<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.550> squeezing<00:01:43.000> as<00:01:43.150> much<00:01:43.330> as<00:01:43.479> as

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
of the top the squeezing as much as as

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.550 
of the top the squeezing as much as as
hot<00:01:44.020> as<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.229> can<00:01:44.260> yeah<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:46.570> another<00:01:46.780> 10<00:01:47.140> feet

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
hot as you can yeah get another 10 feet

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.560 
hot as you can yeah get another 10 feet
contractions<00:01:48.310> that'll<00:01:49.090> take<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.509> much

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
contractions that'll take you that much

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.560 
contractions that'll take you that much
farther<00:01:50.080> in<00:01:50.380> as<00:01:51.070> far<00:01:51.280> as<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.610> cooporation

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
farther in as far as the cooporation

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.510 
farther in as far as the cooporation
time<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.410> how<00:01:53.590> many<00:01:53.649> sets<00:01:54.100> would<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.369> do<00:01:54.490> on

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
time so how many sets would you do on

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.050 
time so how many sets would you do on
the<00:01:54.700> first<00:01:54.880> exercise<00:01:55.630> brother<00:01:55.930> 4<00:01:56.560> 4<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.700> the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the first exercise brother 4 4 and the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.730 
the first exercise brother 4 4 and the
reps<00:01:58.360> range<00:01:58.690> what<00:01:59.020> would<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.289> say

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
reps range what would you say

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.790 
reps range what would you say
I<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.119> cycle<00:02:01.509> my<00:02:01.600> rep<00:02:01.780> ranges<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.680> know

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
I like the cycle my rep ranges you know

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.290 
I like the cycle my rep ranges you know
for<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.369> if<00:02:03.460> I'm<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:03.700> take<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.119> same
