00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
you're working a stitch repeat say it's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.950 
you're working a stitch repeat say it's
stitches<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.580> it's<00:01:53.120> ten<00:01:53.360> stitches<00:01:53.720> ten

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
stitches and it's ten stitches ten

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.020 
stitches and it's ten stitches ten
stitches<00:01:54.320> ten<00:01:54.560> stitches<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.490> gets<00:01:55.730> really

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
stitches ten stitches it gets really

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.700 
stitches ten stitches it gets really
hard<00:01:56.300> especially<00:01:56.450> when<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.020> more<00:01:57.170> complex<00:01:57.530> it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
hard especially when the more complex it

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.920 
hard especially when the more complex it
is<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.860> keep<00:01:58.280> track<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.760> each<00:01:58.910> section<00:01:59.240> so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
is to keep track of each section so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.550 
is to keep track of each section so
stitch<00:02:00.500> markers<00:02:01.390> are<00:02:02.390> able<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:03.050> keep<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.470> on

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
stitch markers are able to keep you on

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.140 
stitch markers are able to keep you on
track<00:02:03.860> they<00:02:04.220> help<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.580> catch<00:02:04.850> mistakes

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
track they help you catch mistakes

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.330 
track they help you catch mistakes
easier<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.620> when<00:02:06.770> you're<00:02:06.890> working<00:02:07.010> that

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
easier so when you're working that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.910 
easier so when you're working that
tenseness<00:02:07.820> ten<00:02:08.510> stitch<00:02:08.840> section<00:02:09.440> that's<00:02:09.770> a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
tenseness ten stitch section that's a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.680 
tenseness ten stitch section that's a
tongue<00:02:10.100> twister<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.090> get<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.510> stitch

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
tongue twister and you get to the stitch

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.570 
tongue twister and you get to the stitch
marker<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.320> your<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:12.650> stitch<00:02:12.890> off<00:02:13.100> you<00:02:13.370> know

marker and your one stitch off you know

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.040 
marker and your one stitch off you know
that<00:02:13.790> you've<00:02:13.910> only<00:02:14.030> messed<00:02:14.330> up<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.960> that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
that you've only messed up just in that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.810 
that you've only messed up just in that
little<00:02:15.170> section<00:02:15.500> rather<00:02:16.160> than<00:02:16.490> trying<00:02:16.730> to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
little section rather than trying to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.030 
little section rather than trying to
figure<00:02:17.180> out<00:02:17.360> across<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.200> whole<00:02:18.380> row<00:02:18.650> where

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
figure out across the whole row where

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.650 
figure out across the whole row where
did<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.310> miss<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.610> owner<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:20.090> where<00:02:20.390> did<00:02:20.510> you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
did you miss the owner or where did you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.510 
did you miss the owner or where did you
miss<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> decrease<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.340> variety

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
miss the decrease and there's a variety

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.610 
miss the decrease and there's a variety
of<00:02:22.670> different<00:02:23.030> ones<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.870> usually<00:02:24.410> buy<00:02:24.560> these

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
with just a simple B just so that I

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.270 
with just a simple B just so that I
catch<00:02:50.420> them<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> little<00:02:50.990> bit<00:02:51.080> easier<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:52.040> hard

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
catch them a little bit easier it's hard

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.480 
catch them a little bit easier it's hard
to<00:02:52.430> see<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.760> sure<00:02:52.850> in<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.690> camera<00:02:54.080> but<00:02:54.800> just

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
to see I'm sure in the camera but just

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.060 
to see I'm sure in the camera but just
see<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.360> little<00:02:56.600> middle<00:02:56.930> ones<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.560> then

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
see the little middle ones and then

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.400 
see the little middle ones and then
these<00:02:58.220> are<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.459> plastic<00:02:59.150> one<00:02:59.360> or<00:02:59.630> they're

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
these are the plastic one or they're

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.160 
these are the plastic one or they're
almost<00:03:00.680> rubberized<00:03:01.340> because<00:03:02.300> they<00:03:02.450> flex<00:03:02.870> just

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
almost rubberized because they flex just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.199 
almost rubberized because they flex just
a<00:03:03.290> little<00:03:03.560> bit<00:03:03.709> making<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.580> easy<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:05.060> get

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
a little bit making it easy to get

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.270 
a little bit making it easy to get
across<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.750> needle<00:03:06.080> my<00:03:06.320> mom<00:03:06.530> prefers<00:03:07.040> these

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
across the needle my mom prefers these

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.960 
across the needle my mom prefers these
ones<00:03:07.520> herself<00:03:08.680> you'll<00:03:09.680> see<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.890> lot<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.459> really
