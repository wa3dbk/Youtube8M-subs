00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
save you money meaning you're gonna get

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.299

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
a lot more money back from the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.010 
a lot more money back from the
government<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.630> pay<00:00:36.809> every

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
government or if you have to pay every

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530 
government or if you have to pay every
year<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.920> pay<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.280> less<00:00:38.460> money<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
year you're gonna pay them less money so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
year you're gonna pay them less money so
I<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> overriding<00:00:40.739> number<00:00:41.489> one

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I think that the overriding number one

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.420 
I think that the overriding number one
reason<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.270> pay<00:00:42.930> less<00:00:43.140> money<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> IRS<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
reason is pay less money to the IRS and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860 
reason is pay less money to the IRS and
I<00:00:44.520> think<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:44.879> something<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.629> us

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I think that's something that all of us

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
I think that's something that all of us
can<00:00:46.050> relate<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> something<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.219> all<00:00:47.430> want

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
can relate to and something we all want

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
can relate to and something we all want
to<00:00:47.670> accomplish<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.350> only<00:00:49.649> saving<00:00:49.950> money

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
to accomplish but not only saving money

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
to accomplish but not only saving money
but<00:00:50.640> also<00:00:50.910> having<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.960> ability<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.500> have

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
but also having the the ability to have

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
but also having the the ability to have

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
so I think the flexibility of having
multiple<00:01:50.549> businesses<00:01:51.090> being<00:01:51.689> able<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.079> track

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
multiple businesses being able to track

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.039 
multiple businesses being able to track
all<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> expenses<00:01:53.340> online<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> have

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
all the expenses online not have to have

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.170
