00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
didn't seem to be the answer they were

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.670 
didn't seem to be the answer they were
looking<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.890> what

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
looking for what

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.520 
looking for what
no<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.819> it's<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.689> it's<00:03:26.379> not

that at all

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.930 
that at all
I<00:03:27.129> guess<00:03:27.340> I'm<00:03:27.489> blaming<00:03:27.730> myself<00:03:27.969> for<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:29.069> that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
I guess I'm blaming myself for for that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.840 
I guess I'm blaming myself for for that
if<00:03:32.270> whatever<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.720> means
