what<00:00:00.510> we're<00:00:00.659> doing<00:00:00.870> here<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.260> taking<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.190> dent

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
what we're doing here is taking a dent

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.660 
what we're doing here is taking a dent
out<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.210> an<00:00:03.330> alloy<00:00:03.629> wheel<00:00:04.009> bump<00:00:05.009> was<00:00:05.279> hit<00:00:05.490> or<00:00:05.520> a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
out of an alloy wheel bump was hit or a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.039 
out of an alloy wheel bump was hit or a
curb<00:00:05.940> or<00:00:06.060> something<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.629> caused<00:00:06.810> this

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
curb or something and it caused this

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
curb or something and it caused this
dent<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.440> didn't<00:00:07.649> blow<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.890> tire<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
dent it didn't blow the tire and it

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.650 
dent it didn't blow the tire and it
didn't<00:00:08.519> leak<00:00:08.639> any<00:00:08.820> air<00:00:09.000> but<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.300> want<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> take

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
didn't leak any air but we want to take

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.160 
didn't leak any air but we want to take
that<00:00:09.900> out<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.490> you<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.750> see<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:13.019> other

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
video on how to break down the tire

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.210 
video on how to break down the tire
beads<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.410> video<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> focus

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
beads but this video is going to focus

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.660 
beads but this video is going to focus
on<00:00:17.550> how<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> heat<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.539> area<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.410> how<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> beat

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
on how to heat this area and how to beat

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
on how to heat this area and how to beat
the<00:00:20.850> rim<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> very<00:00:21.779> minor<00:00:22.020> dent<00:00:22.350> so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the rim out this is a very minor dent so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
the rim out this is a very minor dent so
my<00:00:23.490> hope<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.939> comes<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.240> pretty<00:00:24.359> easy

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
my hope was it comes out pretty easy

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
my hope was it comes out pretty easy
you're<00:00:25.560> you're<00:00:26.550> supposed<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.000> heat<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> rim

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you're you're supposed to heat the rim

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.550 
you're you're supposed to heat the rim
if<00:00:27.630> you're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.930> change<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.260> shape<00:00:28.529> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
if you're going to change the shape of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
if you're going to change the shape of
it<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.070> prevent<00:00:29.340> cracking<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> may<00:00:30.390> still

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
it to prevent cracking now it may still

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.920 
it to prevent cracking now it may still
crack<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:32.030> I've<00:00:33.030> seen<00:00:33.239> professionals<00:00:33.809> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
crack and I've seen professionals that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
crack and I've seen professionals that
do<00:00:34.469> crack<00:00:34.739> they're<00:00:34.950> always<00:00:35.579> doing<00:00:36.090> this

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
do crack they're always doing this

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.990 
do crack they're always doing this
procedure<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:38.790> take

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
procedure and then they have them take

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.760 
procedure and then they have them take
welded<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.510> well<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.989> guess<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.469> happens<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
welded and well I guess that happens to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.720 
welded and well I guess that happens to
me<00:00:40.860> I'll<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> take<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.309> somewhere<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> get

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
me I'll have to take it somewhere to get

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
me I'll have to take it somewhere to get
a<00:00:41.790> TIG<00:00:41.969> weld<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> heat<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.649> up

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
a TIG weld but we're going to heat it up

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400 
a TIG weld but we're going to heat it up
and<00:00:44.610> wear<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.239> alloy<00:00:45.780> probably<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and wear it is an alloy probably a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.400 
and wear it is an alloy probably a
pretty<00:00:46.800> heavy<00:00:46.980> aluminum<00:00:47.280> content<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pretty heavy aluminum content the the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.930 
pretty heavy aluminum content the the
thermal<00:00:49.890> conductivity<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.730> high<00:00:50.910> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
thermal conductivity is really high so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
thermal conductivity is really high so
if<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.390> heat<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.690> area<00:00:51.989> it'll<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.890> hot<00:00:53.039> quite

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
if we heat this area it'll get hot quite

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.189 
if we heat this area it'll get hot quite
a<00:00:53.489> distance<00:00:53.879> around<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> quickly<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a distance around there and quickly so

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
a distance around there and quickly so
we're<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.219> heat

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
we're going what we're going to do heat

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
we're going what we're going to do heat
it<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> pound<00:00:58.289> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it up and then we're going to pound on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
it up and then we're going to pound on
it<00:00:58.530> I've<00:00:58.710> got<00:00:58.859> some<00:00:59.070> hard<00:00:59.280> wood<00:00:59.430> pieces<00:00:59.699> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it I've got some hard wood pieces that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.319 
it I've got some hard wood pieces that
are<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> shape<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> rim<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.149> we're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
are in the shape of the rim and so we're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.369 
are in the shape of the rim and so we're
going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
going to we're going to see how that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
going to we're going to see how that
goes<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.920> pound<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.369> those<00:01:05.519> hard<00:01:05.729> wood<00:01:05.880> pieces

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
goes we pound on those hard wood pieces

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.390 
goes we pound on those hard wood pieces
to<00:01:07.080> try<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> protect<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> rim<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> little<00:01:08.100> bit

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to try to protect the rim a little bit

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.500 
to try to protect the rim a little bit
as<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.670> straightening<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> we'll<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.390> how

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
as we're straightening it we'll see how

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.730 
as we're straightening it we'll see how
that<00:01:09.570> goes<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.080> doesn't<00:01:10.350> work<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.650> going

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that goes if that doesn't work I'm going

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.200 
that goes if that doesn't work I'm going
to<00:01:10.830> throw<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.100> away<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.610> smack<00:01:12.000> right

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to throw this away and just smack right

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
to throw this away and just smack right
on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> rim<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> probably<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.280> 20

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
on the rim we've got a probably at 20

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.390 
on the rim we've got a probably at 20
maybe<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> 30<00:01:15.630> ounce<00:01:15.810> hammer<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.250> got

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
maybe a 30 ounce hammer here and we got

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.260 
maybe a 30 ounce hammer here and we got
a<00:01:17.430> two<00:01:17.729> pound<00:01:18.590> two<00:01:19.590> pounds<00:01:19.700> Maul<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.150> we

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
a two pound two pounds Maul here if we

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
a two pound two pounds Maul here if we
need<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.600> use<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.770> pound<00:01:22.979> sledge<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
need to use that two pound sledge so

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
need to use that two pound sledge so
we'll<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.360> happens<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> good

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
we'll see what happens but have a good

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.690 
we'll see what happens but have a good
look<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> debt<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.490> we'll<00:01:26.610> get

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
look at that debt and then we'll get

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
look at that debt and then we'll get
started<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.210> actually<00:01:27.479> bent<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
started it's actually bent here and it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.870 
started it's actually bent here and it
may<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.680> hard<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> video<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.790> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
may be hard in the video to see but it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
may be hard in the video to see but it's
also<00:01:30.060> bent<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> inner<00:01:30.780> part<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> lip

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
also bent on the inner part of the lip

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.899 
also bent on the inner part of the lip
here<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> did<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.549> got<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
here we go what I did is I got one of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.160 
here we go what I did is I got one of
these<00:01:34.640> digital<00:01:35.640> thermometers<00:01:36.170> 15<00:01:37.170> degrees<00:01:39.170> 25

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
these digital thermometers 15 degrees 25

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.719 
these digital thermometers 15 degrees 25
degrees<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.799> what<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> heat

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
degrees so what I'm going to do is heat

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
degrees so what I'm going to do is heat
it<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:41.909> until<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.540> 150<00:01:43.110> degrees

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it up until it's about 150 degrees

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.429 
it up until it's about 150 degrees
Celsius<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.000> I'll<00:01:45.869> start<00:01:45.990> whaling

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
Celsius and then all I'll start whaling

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:59.950 
Celsius and then all I'll start whaling
on

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.170 

all<00:02:00.650> right<00:02:00.800> that's<00:02:01.310> up<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> couple<00:02:02.090> hundred

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
all right that's up to a couple hundred

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.749 
all right that's up to a couple hundred
degrees<00:02:02.540> Celsius<00:02:02.960> they're<00:02:06.370> three<00:02:07.370> places<00:02:07.670> you

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
degrees Celsius they're three places you

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.520 
degrees Celsius they're three places you
can<00:02:10.759> smell<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.180> rubber<00:02:11.510> certain<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.050> heat<00:02:12.440> up

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
can smell that rubber certain it heat up

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.830 
can smell that rubber certain it heat up
a<00:02:12.590> little<00:02:12.740> bit<00:02:13.150> not<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.390> worry<00:02:14.570> about<00:02:14.630> it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
a little bit not to worry about it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:03:01.500 
a little bit not to worry about it
though<00:02:14.960> okay<00:02:51.100> better<00:02:52.100> right<00:02:52.459> yeah<00:02:59.290> really

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
though okay better right yeah really

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.930 
though okay better right yeah really
there<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:02.780> still<00:03:06.310> don't<00:03:07.310> mean<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.519> go<00:03:07.670> off<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
there but still don't mean to go off the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.500 
there but still don't mean to go off the
hook<00:03:08.120> at<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.269> edge<00:03:09.489> okay<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.239> see

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
hook at the edge okay so you can see

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.440 
hook at the edge okay so you can see
here<00:03:11.840> we<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.130> it<00:03:13.250> mostly<00:03:13.880> round<00:03:14.060> it's<00:03:14.269> not

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
here we we have it mostly round it's not

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.960 
here we we have it mostly round it's not
perfect<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.739> was<00:03:16.280> way<00:03:16.459> better<00:03:16.610> than<00:03:16.760> it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
perfect but it was way better than it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.289 
perfect but it was way better than it
was<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.900> was<00:03:18.080> actually<00:03:18.260> warped<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:19.519> here<00:03:20.150> and

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
was it was actually warped in here and

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.449 
was it was actually warped in here and
then<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.780> lip<00:03:20.989> was<00:03:21.200> warped<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.070> lip<00:03:22.280> was

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
then the lip was warped and the lip was

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.660 
then the lip was warped and the lip was
up<00:03:22.640> as<00:03:22.940> well<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.720> beat<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.830> here<00:03:25.220> we

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
up as well so we beat it out here we

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.820 
up as well so we beat it out here we
beat<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.209> lip<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.690> then<00:03:27.230> we<00:03:27.320> beat<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.709> the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
beat out the lip and then we beat in the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.039 
beat out the lip and then we beat in the
lip<00:03:28.010> right<00:03:28.220> here<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.760> kind<00:03:29.360> of<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.750> best<00:03:29.900> we

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
lip right here to kind of do the best we

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:30.340 
lip right here to kind of do the best we
could

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
could

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.370 
could
it's<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.580> pretty<00:03:31.850> good<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.170> think<00:03:33.170> it'll<00:03:33.260> be

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
it's it's pretty good I think it'll be

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.970 
it's it's pretty good I think it'll be
alright<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:35.380> yeah<00:03:36.380> well<00:03:36.620> that's<00:03:36.769> on<00:03:36.890> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
alright and yeah well that's on the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.100 
alright and yeah well that's on the
inside<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.370> rim<00:03:37.489> anyway<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.989> were

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
inside of the rim anyway if you were

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.630 
inside of the rim anyway if you were
doing<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.620> outside<00:03:39.650> maybe<00:03:40.220> people<00:03:40.459> would

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
doing on the outside maybe people would

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.120 
doing on the outside maybe people would
be<00:03:40.730> upset<00:03:41.030> about<00:03:41.060> those<00:03:41.360> marks<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.200> we<00:03:42.980> don't

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
be upset about those marks but we don't

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.340 
be upset about those marks but we don't
care<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:43.519> what<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:44.209> did<00:03:44.360> was<00:03:44.630> we<00:03:44.900> took<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.200> piece

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
care so what we did was we took a piece

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.720 
care so what we did was we took a piece
of<00:03:45.470> wood<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.860> tried<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.160> pound<00:03:46.400> on<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.579> wood

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
of wood and tried to pound on the wood

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.640 
of wood and tried to pound on the wood
and<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:46.970> wood<00:03:47.000> broke<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.320> died<00:03:48.530> you

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and the wood broke so that died you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.759 
and the wood broke so that died you
didn't<00:03:48.860> work<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.640> then<00:03:50.150> we<00:03:50.750> used<00:03:51.590> some

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
didn't work and then we used some

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.759 
didn't work and then we used some
various<00:03:52.100> hammers<00:03:52.459> here<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.410> kind<00:03:54.620> of

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
various hammers here and this is kind of

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.569 
various hammers here and this is kind of
one<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.220> popular<00:03:55.579> ones<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:58.010> kind<00:03:58.459> of

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
one of the popular ones and to kind of

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.300 
one of the popular ones and to kind of
more<00:03:59.329> accurately<00:03:59.750> direct<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.380> smack<00:04:01.040> we'd

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
more accurately direct the smack we'd

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.340 
more accurately direct the smack we'd
hold<00:04:01.489> one<00:04:01.670> hammer<00:04:01.940> there<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.750> then<00:04:02.870> smock<00:04:03.170> it

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
hold one hammer there and then smock it

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.380 
hold one hammer there and then smock it
with<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.590> rig<00:04:03.769> red<00:04:03.950> one<00:04:04.160> we'd<00:04:05.060> move<00:04:05.239> this

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
with the rig red one we'd move this

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.080 
with the rig red one we'd move this
around<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.870> we<00:04:05.959> could<00:04:06.079> target<00:04:06.290> our<00:04:06.560> spots

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
around so we could target our spots

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.960 
around so we could target our spots
we<00:04:08.720> had<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:08.959> reheat<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.530> tire

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
we had to reheat the tire

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.640 
we had to reheat the tire
rym<00:04:10.210> several<00:04:10.630> times<00:04:10.870> through<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.230> job<00:04:11.440> just

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
rym several times through the job just

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.240 
rym several times through the job just
to<00:04:11.800> keep<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.070> temperature<00:04:12.520> up<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.510> then<00:04:14.290> this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
to keep the temperature up and then this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.979 
to keep the temperature up and then this
rounded<00:04:15.940> piece<00:04:16.120> here<00:04:16.299> is<00:04:16.450> really<00:04:16.690> not<00:04:16.810> as

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
rounded piece here is really not as

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.020 
rounded piece here is really not as
rounded<00:04:17.320> as<00:04:17.440> as<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:17.980> should<00:04:18.040> have<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.760> was

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
rounded as as you should have but it was

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.520

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
was nice is the truck parked on the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.480 
was nice is the truck parked on the
boards<00:04:32.080> parked<00:04:32.380> on<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.530> tire<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.340> whole

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
boards parked on the tire the whole

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.680 
boards parked on the tire the whole
thing<00:04:33.670> stayed<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.000> place<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.330> we<00:04:34.390> can<00:04:34.420> pound

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
thing stayed in place and we can pound

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.570 
thing stayed in place and we can pound
on<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.140> didn't<00:04:35.350> really<00:04:35.470> even<00:04:35.650> wrap<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
on it and it didn't really even wrap to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.870 
on it and it didn't really even wrap to
myself<00:04:36.790> all<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.930> was<00:04:38.080> good<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:40.110> what<00:04:41.110> else

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
myself all that was good and what else

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.100 
myself all that was good and what else
well<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.090> think<00:04:43.240> that's<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.660> for<00:04:43.690> the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
well I think that's it for the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.390 
well I think that's it for the
do-it-yourself<00:04:44.740> video<00:04:45.010> on<00:04:45.160> how<00:04:45.340> to
