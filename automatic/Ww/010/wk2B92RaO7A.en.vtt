00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey guys what's up Tyler here and today
I'm<00:00:02.070> gonna<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.310> reviewing<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.970> app<00:00:03.149> called

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
I'm gonna be reviewing the app called

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.110 
I'm gonna be reviewing the app called
manual<00:00:04.140> camera<00:00:04.680> for<00:00:04.890> Android<00:00:05.310> devices<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
manual camera for Android devices and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.839 
manual camera for Android devices and
now<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:07.020> camera<00:00:07.319> utilizes<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.340> camera<00:00:08.700> to

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
now this camera utilizes the camera to

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.540 
now this camera utilizes the camera to
API<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.599> an<00:00:09.750> Android<00:00:10.290> lollipop<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.160> it

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
API with an Android lollipop and it

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.370 
API with an Android lollipop and it
basically<00:00:11.670> unlocks<00:00:12.540> your<00:00:12.840> whole<00:00:13.080> camera

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
basically unlocks your whole camera

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.289 
basically unlocks your whole camera
because<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.099> my<00:00:14.219> opinion<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> stock<00:00:14.969> camera

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
because in my opinion the stock camera

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.840 
because in my opinion the stock camera
with<00:00:15.690> lollipop<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> piece<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.890> junk<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.310> can't

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
with lollipop is a piece of junk I can't

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460 
with lollipop is a piece of junk I can't
change<00:00:18.060> white<00:00:18.330> balance<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.900> can't<00:00:19.199> change

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
change white balance I can't change

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.109 
change white balance I can't change
exposure<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.070> can't<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.430> anything<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
exposure I can't do anything with this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.380 
exposure I can't do anything with this
thing<00:00:21.390> besides<00:00:22.109> record<00:00:22.800> video<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.390> pictures

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
thing besides record video or pictures

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689 
thing besides record video or pictures
and<00:00:24.660> switch<00:00:25.350> between<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.769> front-facing<00:00:26.400> in

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and switch between the front-facing in

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.060 
and switch between the front-facing in
the<00:00:26.820> back<00:00:26.970> camera<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.710> was

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the back camera that's it and so I was

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.470 
the back camera that's it and so I was
needing<00:00:29.340> something<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> enabled<00:00:30.330> me<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
needing something that enabled me to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
needing something that enabled me to
change<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> take<00:00:31.890> pictures<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
change the way I take pictures and so I

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
change the way I take pictures and so I
was<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.910> hunt<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.719> found<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.140> app

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
was on the hunt and I found this app

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.709 
was on the hunt and I found this app
manual<00:00:34.950> camera<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:36.180> now<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.600> only

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
manual camera and right now it's only

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
manual camera and right now it's only
working<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> couple<00:00:37.590> devices<00:00:37.800> because<00:00:38.309> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
working for a couple devices because it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.260 
working for a couple devices because it
uses<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.910> camera<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.420> API<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.170> lollipop<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
uses the camera to API from lollipop and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
uses the camera to API from lollipop and
if<00:00:42.270> your<00:00:42.510> phone<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.140> supported<00:00:43.710> does<00:00:44.129> not

if your phone is not supported does not

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.860

support the actual app you can tell

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
support the actual app you can tell

because they offer a free app as like a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.069 
because they offer a free app as like a
test<00:00:47.820> app<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> don't<00:00:48.570> waste<00:00:48.870> your

speed your flash all this stuff and it's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.510

actually<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.860> cool<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> actually

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
actually really cool when it actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
actually really cool when it actually
works<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:15.090> well<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.259> take<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
works very well and so if we take a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
works very well and so if we take a
closer<00:01:16.950> look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> app<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
closer look at the app you will see that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
closer look at the app you will see that
up<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> top<00:01:18.900> left-hand<00:01:19.259> corner<00:01:19.500> going

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
up at the top left-hand corner going

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
up at the top left-hand corner going
across<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.150> our<00:01:21.299> exposure<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.990> can

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
across we have our exposure we can

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
across we have our exposure we can
change<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.710> everything's<00:01:23.460> set<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> auto<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
change and everything's set to auto and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
change and everything's set to auto and
you<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.540> open<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.900> phone<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.439> once<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you first open the phone but once you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
you first open the phone but once you
touch<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.450> choices<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.869> move

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
touch one of the choices and you move

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080 
touch one of the choices and you move
the<00:01:28.200> dial<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> goes<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.549> auto<00:01:29.790> mode

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the dial then it goes out of auto mode

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
the dial then it goes out of auto mode
as<00:01:30.570> soon<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> touch<00:01:31.200> exposure<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
as soon as you touch exposure or the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
as soon as you touch exposure or the
icer<00:01:32.369> levels<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:32.939> changes<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.630> goes

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
icer levels that all changes it goes

focusing in on text that's in a close
range<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.450> photos<00:02:39.810> always<00:02:40.019> come<00:02:40.230> out

range and so the photos always come out

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.809 
range and so the photos always come out
blurry<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.800> doesn't<00:02:41.069> focus<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> text

but with this manual camera app I can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.309 
but with this manual camera app I can
set<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.700> focus<00:02:44.910> length<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.780> focus<00:02:46.110> point

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
set the focus length and the focus point

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.350 
set the focus length and the focus point
wherever<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.739> want<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.519> easily<00:02:47.849> focus<00:02:48.060> in

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
wherever I want so I can easily focus in

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.570 
wherever I want so I can easily focus in
on<00:02:48.450> something<00:02:48.720> very<00:02:48.930> close<00:02:49.349> or<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.340> focus

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
on something very close or I can focus

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.100 
on something very close or I can focus
on<00:02:50.819> something<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.269> far<00:02:51.510> away<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:51.989> by

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
on something very far away just by

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.809 
on something very far away just by
sliding<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> dial<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.580> works<00:02:53.730> very

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
sliding the dial and so it works very

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.350 
sliding the dial and so it works very
well<00:02:54.060> whenever<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.989> need<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.440> decide<00:02:56.430> what<00:02:57.239> is

is<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> lot<00:03:04.110> quicker<00:03:04.440> than<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.950> stock<00:03:05.280> camera

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
is a lot quicker than the stock camera

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.040 
is a lot quicker than the stock camera
that's<00:03:05.819> on<00:03:06.030> my<00:03:06.209> Android<00:03:06.540> phone<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.900> have<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
that's on my Android phone I have a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.080 
that's on my Android phone I have a
nexus<00:03:07.319> 5<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.159> it's<00:03:08.310> running<00:03:08.459> just<00:03:08.640> stalky

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
nexus 5 and so it's running just stalky

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.360 
nexus 5 and so it's running just stalky
Android<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.349> stock<00:03:10.620> camera<00:03:10.890> app<00:03:11.099> can<00:03:11.340> be

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
Android but the stock camera app can be

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.979 
Android but the stock camera app can be
sluggish<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.879> times<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.360> found<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
sluggish at times but I found that the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.570 
sluggish at times but I found that the
manual<00:03:13.290> camera<00:03:13.470> app<00:03:13.709> takes<00:03:14.010> pictures<00:03:14.400> at<00:03:14.550> a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
manual camera app takes pictures at a

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.309 
manual camera app takes pictures at a
much<00:03:14.849> faster<00:03:15.150> rate<00:03:15.360> now<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.110> are<00:03:16.200> really

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
much faster rate now there are really

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.020 
much faster rate now there are really
only<00:03:16.440> three<00:03:16.680> issues<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.250> found<00:03:17.489> with<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.819> app

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
only three issues I found with this app

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.670 
only three issues I found with this app
that<00:03:18.300> really<00:03:18.720> are<00:03:18.930> deal-breakers<00:03:19.170> but

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that really are deal-breakers but

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.470 
that really are deal-breakers but
they're<00:03:19.860> kind<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.489> things<00:03:20.909> that<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> wish<00:03:21.330> they

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
they're kind of things that I wish they

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.210 
they're kind of things that I wish they
would<00:03:21.599> fix<00:03:21.810> number<00:03:22.379> one<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.830> there<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.069> no

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
would fix number one is there is no

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.309 
would fix number one is there is no
front-facing<00:03:23.819> camera<00:03:24.330> support<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.200> know

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
front-facing camera support now I know

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.080 
front-facing camera support now I know
the<00:03:25.530> front-facing<00:03:25.799> camera<00:03:26.400> probably<00:03:26.670> isn't

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the front-facing camera probably isn't

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.610 
the front-facing camera probably isn't
near<00:03:27.269> as<00:03:27.299> powerful<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.900> know<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.379> near<00:03:28.530> as

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
near as powerful I know it's not near as

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.199 
near as powerful I know it's not near as
powerful<00:03:28.769> as<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.340> back<00:03:29.489> facing<00:03:29.879> camera<00:03:30.180> so

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
powerful as the back facing camera so

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.729 
powerful as the back facing camera so
I'm<00:03:30.420> not<00:03:30.540> sure<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:30.930> all<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.080> settings<00:03:31.500> could

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
I'm not sure if all the settings could

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.800 
I'm not sure if all the settings could
still<00:03:32.010> work<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.940> front-facing<00:03:33.239> camera

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
still work with the front-facing camera

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.270 
still work with the front-facing camera
or<00:03:33.930> I'll<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.290> strip<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.650> down<00:03:34.769> just<00:03:35.190> to

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
or I'll have to strip it down just to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.339 
or I'll have to strip it down just to
access<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.790> front-facing<00:03:36.180> camera<00:03:36.659> but<00:03:37.230> it'd

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
access the front-facing camera but it'd

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.660 
access the front-facing camera but it'd
be<00:03:37.440> really<00:03:37.620> nice<00:03:37.830> if<00:03:37.890> they<00:03:38.190> could<00:03:38.250> have<00:03:38.519> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
be really nice if they could have that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.920 
be really nice if they could have that
feature<00:03:38.879> because<00:03:39.239> right<00:03:39.420> now<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.599> still<00:03:39.870> have

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
feature because right now I still have

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
feature because right now I still have
to<00:03:40.080> use<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> stock<00:03:40.530> camera<00:03:40.799> if<00:03:41.159> I<00:03:41.400> need<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.700> use

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
to use a stock camera if I need to use

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.130 
to use a stock camera if I need to use
the<00:03:41.940> front-facing<00:03:42.330> camera<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:42.780> anything

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
the front-facing camera for anything

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.390 
the front-facing camera for anything
another<00:03:43.769> thing<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.159> might<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
another thing that might be a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.520 
another thing that might be a
deal-breaker<00:03:44.670> for<00:03:44.970> some<00:03:45.450> people<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.379> it

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
deal-breaker for some people is that it

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.589 
deal-breaker for some people is that it
does<00:03:46.680> not<00:03:46.830> have<00:03:47.220> video<00:03:47.580> support<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:48.239> can<00:03:48.390> only

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
does not have video support it can only

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.809 
does not have video support it can only
be<00:03:48.840> used<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.170> take<00:03:49.379> pictures<00:03:49.860> now<00:03:50.430> down<00:03:50.670> the

be used to take pictures now down the
road<00:03:50.970> they<00:03:51.150> might<00:03:51.330> add<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.049> as<00:03:52.170> well<00:03:52.349> as

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
road they might add this that as well as

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.289 
road they might add this that as well as
the<00:03:52.530> front-facing<00:03:52.950> camera<00:03:53.370> support<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.180> as

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
the front-facing camera support but as

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.670 
the front-facing camera support but as
of<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:54.569> now<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.780> cannot<00:03:55.110> shoot<00:03:55.379> video<00:03:55.650> with

of right now you cannot shoot video with
this<00:03:55.890> only<00:03:56.159> useful<00:03:56.489> for<00:03:56.700> taking<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.239> lot<00:03:57.420> of

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
this only useful for taking a lot of

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.850 
this only useful for taking a lot of
pictures<00:03:57.689> now<00:03:58.260> there's<00:03:58.439> one<00:03:58.560> other<00:03:58.590> little

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
pictures now there's one other little

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.710 
pictures now there's one other little
thing<00:03:58.980> that's<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.400> little<00:03:59.430> issue<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.450> really<00:04:00.689> a

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
thing that's a little issue not really a

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.809 
thing that's a little issue not really a
big<00:04:00.959> deal<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.200> me<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:02.220> whenever<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.610> take

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
big deal to me is that whenever you take

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.670 
big deal to me is that whenever you take
a<00:04:02.879> picture<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:03.810> take<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.409> then<00:04:04.530> you'll

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
a picture you can take it then you'll

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.780 
a picture you can take it then you'll
see<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.010> bottom<00:04:05.310> right<00:04:05.430> hand<00:04:05.580> corner

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
see it in the bottom right hand corner

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.179

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
can easily be fixed with some

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.960 
can easily be fixed with some
programming<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:17.430> sure<00:04:17.579> that's<00:04:17.759> gonna<00:04:17.880> be

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
programming so I'm sure that's gonna be

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.210 
programming so I'm sure that's gonna be
fixed<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.479> an<00:04:18.810> upcoming<00:04:18.959> update<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:20.100> it's

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
fixed in an upcoming update but it's

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.650 
fixed in an upcoming update but it's
just<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.430> small<00:04:20.579> little<00:04:20.910> bug<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.299> found

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
just a small little bug that I found

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.390 
just a small little bug that I found
that<00:04:21.810> can<00:04:22.019> be<00:04:22.109> annoying<00:04:22.320> for<00:04:22.590> some<00:04:22.620> people<00:04:23.070> and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that can be annoying for some people and

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.490 
that can be annoying for some people and
so<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.699> app<00:04:23.940> costs<00:04:24.449> $2.99

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
so this app costs $2.99

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.680 
so this app costs $2.99
and<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.890> worth<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.520> think<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.270> because

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
and is it worth it I think it is because

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.690 
and is it worth it I think it is because
the<00:04:28.320> stock<00:04:28.560> camera<00:04:28.860> app<00:04:29.040> was<00:04:29.280> getting<00:04:29.520> really

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
the stock camera app was getting really

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.190 
the stock camera app was getting really
annoying<00:04:30.000> for<00:04:30.240> me<00:04:30.330> because<00:04:30.540> it's<00:04:30.690> slow<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.170> I

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
annoying for me because it's slow and I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320 
annoying for me because it's slow and I
couldn't<00:04:31.440> change<00:04:31.770> anything<00:04:32.250> i<00:04:32.670> sat<00:04:33.000> here<00:04:33.030> for

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
couldn't change anything i sat here for

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.550 
couldn't change anything i sat here for
ten<00:04:33.480> minutes<00:04:33.720> one<00:04:33.840> day<00:04:33.960> trying<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.290> figure<00:04:34.470> out

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
ten minutes one day trying to figure out

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.840 
ten minutes one day trying to figure out
how<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.830> change<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.160> white<00:04:35.310> balance<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.790> I

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
how to change the white balance and I

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.220 
how to change the white balance and I
couldn't<00:04:36.090> figure<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.300> out<00:04:36.450> unless<00:04:36.960> there's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
couldn't figure it out unless there's

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.750 
couldn't figure it out unless there's
some<00:04:37.380> mystical<00:04:37.830> way<00:04:37.920> that<00:04:38.100> I<00:04:38.130> don't<00:04:38.400> know<00:04:38.550> of

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
some mystical way that I don't know of

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.600 
some mystical way that I don't know of
there<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.390> no<00:04:39.570> way<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.890> think<00:04:41.310> it's

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
there is no way and so I think it's

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.010 
there is no way and so I think it's
definitely<00:04:41.670> worth<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.150> three<00:04:42.540> bucks<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.990> I

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
definitely worth the three bucks that I

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.540 
definitely worth the three bucks that I
paid<00:04:43.320> for<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.590> because<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.070> completely

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
paid for it because it completely

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.760 
paid for it because it completely
unlocks<00:04:45.210> your<00:04:45.450> camera<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.960> change<00:04:46.200> manually

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
unlocks your camera to change manually

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.370 
unlocks your camera to change manually
pretty<00:04:47.250> much<00:04:47.460> everything<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:49.200> really

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
pretty much everything and it really

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.990 
pretty much everything and it really
just<00:04:49.590> opens<00:04:50.040> up<00:04:50.160> possibilities<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.850> can

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
just opens up possibilities you can

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.810 
just opens up possibilities you can
change<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.050> take<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.590> very<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.370> completely

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
change it to take a very just completely

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.140 
change it to take a very just completely
just<00:04:54.440> blown<00:04:55.440> out<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.650> proportion<00:04:55.740> white<00:04:56.700> image

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
just blown out of proportion white image

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.700 
just blown out of proportion white image
or<00:04:57.420> you<00:04:57.570> can<00:04:57.720> get<00:04:57.870> really<00:04:58.140> dark<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.530> grainy

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710
