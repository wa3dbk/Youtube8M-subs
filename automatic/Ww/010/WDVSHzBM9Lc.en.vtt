feeling<00:01:17.040> something<00:01:17.310> holographic<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.150> i<00:01:18.210> know

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
feeling something holographic so i know

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
feeling something holographic so i know
that<00:01:18.509> i<00:01:18.540> included<00:01:19.020> aurora<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.710> dream<00:01:20.100> from
