the<00:01:24.590> right-hand<00:01:25.010> Bend<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.520> take<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.119> pretty

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
the right-hand Bend I take it pretty

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.180 
the right-hand Bend I take it pretty
fast<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:27.020> then<00:01:27.440> move<00:01:27.650> right<00:01:27.890> into<00:01:28.100> a

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
left-hand curve the vehicle goes where I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
left-hand curve the vehicle goes where I
wanted<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:30.979> go<00:01:31.190> right<00:01:31.460> down<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.880> last

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
wanted to go right down to the last

wanted to go right down to the last
millimeter<00:01:32.450> such<00:01:33.440> moments<00:01:33.950> are<00:01:34.040> simply

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
millimeter such moments are simply

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.030 
millimeter such moments are simply
amazing

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.410 

it's<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.220> enough<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> use<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> wing<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it's not enough to use a wing to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
it's not enough to use a wing to
generate<00:01:42.780> downforce<00:01:43.260> in<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.250> have

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
generate downforce in the back you have

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.190 
generate downforce in the back you have
to<00:01:44.550> create<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.970> balance<00:01:45.330> between<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.810> rear<00:01:46.050> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to create a balance between the rear and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050 
to create a balance between the rear and
the<00:01:46.290> front<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.979> why<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.400> have<00:01:47.550> openings<00:01:47.940> on

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the front that's why we have openings on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
the front that's why we have openings on
the<00:01:48.090> wings<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.479> actively<00:01:48.960> vent<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> wheel

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the wings that actively vent the wheel

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.359 
the wings that actively vent the wheel
arches<00:01:50.900> 220<00:01:51.900> now<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.500> fastest<00:01:53.040> band<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
arches 220 now the fastest band is

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
arches 220 now the fastest band is
coming<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.930> immediately

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
coming up here as well you immediately

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859 
coming up here as well you immediately
notice<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.100> tremendous<00:01:56.280> downforce<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.540> how

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
notice the tremendous downforce and how

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.620 
notice the tremendous downforce and how
stable<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.440> car<00:01:58.650> remains<00:01:59.180> the<00:02:00.180> trick<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
stable the car remains the trick is to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.840 
stable the car remains the trick is to
get<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.290> downforce<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> front<00:02:02.340> then

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
get a lot of downforce in the front then

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.370 
get a lot of downforce in the front then
you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.119> counterbalance<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> back

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you can counterbalance it in the back

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.280 
you can counterbalance it in the back
even<00:02:04.770> racecars<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.700> our<00:02:05.880> gt3<00:02:06.509> Cup<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:07.110> only

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
even racecars like our gt3 Cup have only

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.169 
even racecars like our gt3 Cup have only
a<00:02:07.380> little<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:07.979> downforce<00:02:08.459> than<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.880> car

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a little more downforce than this car

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
a little more downforce than this car
we're<00:02:09.750> talking<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.229> three<00:02:10.649> hundred<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
we're talking about three hundred and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.590 
we're talking about three hundred and
fifty<00:02:11.280> kilograms<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.910> additional<00:02:12.390> downforce

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
fifty kilograms of additional downforce

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.810
