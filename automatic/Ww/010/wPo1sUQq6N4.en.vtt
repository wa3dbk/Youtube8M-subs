00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.290
 today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.000
 Gradation 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.000
 I will do the cutter a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.600
 First of all, it's a layer now , so once 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.170
 Floor height 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.170
 Cut 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.070
 About normal gradation 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510
 Consideration 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.300
 Escape 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.630
 road 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.530
 To distant 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.530
 Together 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.890
 On that's day to glory 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.890
 The top is long 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.820
 More than 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.950
 Here is this 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.729
 I can't beer with my voice 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.729
 This is a gradation 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.070
 vice versa 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.790
 It is not the opposite 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.770
 This here 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.150
 When 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.070
 I'm far and the same length 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.320
 If you cut this much it is positive 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.180
 Same layer same 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.180
 A statement that will be the same length 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.440
 Heart and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.160
 Koyurimomo 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.160
 Against 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.990
 The top is short 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 When you have a cut navy blue gray 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 It will be a layer star 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.070
 Welcome 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.899
 It is how to put gradation 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.140
 Normally 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.140
 so 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.450
 Can speak 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.230
 Gradation on pulling out 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.350
 45 degrees 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.380
 With Marmot Umeda 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.650
 Around 30 degrees 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 please ~ 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.760
 Around 15 degrees 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.940
 Hmm 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.590
 In my own way 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.590
 On the scalp 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.090
 I so far 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.770
 Pull out 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.569
 This Yomi 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.310
 Finger 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.870
 line 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.850
 Another Again 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.540
 I will be cured 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.069
 now 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.800
 This outline 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.660
 The line below is 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.490
 I think I came here 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.490
 When I had coffee at this point 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.300
 As you can see here, from there 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.110
 The upper one is with a scissors as it is with gradation etc. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.050
 let me in 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.700
 Pull a little 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.210
 Play 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.100
 Play 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.680
 It is to hit 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.790
 Repeat this 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.790
 It looks like this 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.330
 Yup 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.650
 Next time this gradation 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.660
 As it is this side a little now 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.069
 I cut it to here 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.310
 This time 9 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.580
 Together each year 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.330
 Where did Ida go? 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.330
 While listening to 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.799
 This time 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.010
 On the scalp 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.010
 All according to the shape of Marui scalp 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.200
 I will carry out the whole process 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.639
 Then 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.620
 When placed in a conventional 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.620
 The gradation 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.860
 Similar 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.930
 I'd cut off feeling is that this ne 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.460
 Beyond 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.460
 It's with a so wear this guy 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.169
 It is cherry blossom to say what is different 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.169
 For example, at this time 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.470
 Hamamoto 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:52.129
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.260
 Just like this slippery 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:59.070
 I have made it 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.770
 Here is only the side of this side and this side 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.080
 Hmm 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.080
 When I say that I like it 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.480
 Good luck 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.140
 It is not 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.140
 Rideal 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.370
 Go wrong 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.770
 It can be done 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.770
 later 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.080
 this 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.280
 coil 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.940
 When I cut it by voice 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.940
 Cut edge 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.550
 Management becomes shorter 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.390
 I'm doing it 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.390
 Some examples 8 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.880
 Is 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.880
 East 1 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.750
 Gram angle 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.790
 If you can 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.490
 The graph is cut with gradation 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.620
 To the cut end 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.890
 Can be manipulated 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.890
 The 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.110
 Own 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.729
 It Is You brewed of the filtrate gradients 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.540
 Oh dear 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.790
 It is also to say so 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.510
 I thought that I did not know who was worried about 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.210
 Even 1 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.020
 If you write in the comment 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.020
 Because I answer 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.830
 Today is over
