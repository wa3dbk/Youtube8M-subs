00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.960
 mission that you once accomplished 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.150
 you can play normally directly over the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.440
 choose the main medication and you can 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.400
 she sometimes even with others 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.400
 play character 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.810
 one knows from gta 4 the kind of beer into 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.500
 Water and the jacket competition mark 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.440
 to get 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.420
 I have seen on the t-shirt the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.060
 body was worn there stood shower gold 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.340
 so apparently so also in the 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.660
 original version means that shower and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:57.350
 seems to have it there with german 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:59.150
 is understood what you did not know 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.100
 that as in gta 4 the possibility 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.080
 will give up meeting with friends 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.080
 and doing something together 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.320
 in the gta 4 it was so that one weapons 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.300
 how did you lose when you go to 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.620
 Example , if the ammunition was all or 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 if you were arrested 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.870
 That is not the case now 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.159
 purchased weapons are obtained permanently 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.159
 even if you land the jail 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.440
 You 've got a smartphone now 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.280
 and may you can even apps 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.530
 download 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.150
 I got an app in a mission 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.119
 Smart phone sent the track free 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.820
 and with it I could get the phone from 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.030
 Michael places the captured 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.030
 has been 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.970
 In the game there is a place in the mountain 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.710
 Shepherd and Michael for a gay 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.460
 Whatever you pay for, you will be rewarded 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.460
 can come on it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.980
 it will characterize a reunion 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.530
 from gta 4 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 I've already seen that, but if 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.400
 I would talk about it 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 After each mission you get one now 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.420
 rating and also a checklist whether 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:41.209
 one has certain tasks within the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.530
 mission is done in one 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.239
 mission failed you can 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.380
 decide if you want to try it again 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.269
 would like or if you want the mission 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.769
 but this is true 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.730
 only for missions not to 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.730
 main story taken 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.709
 you can not just his weapons 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.520
 Upgrade with silencer or larger 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.959
 magazine 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.880
 they can even be optically 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.569
 beautify for example by a 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.569
 special paint
