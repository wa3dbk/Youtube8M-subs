hello<00:00:18.230> my<00:00:18.470> spearfishing<00:00:18.950> community<00:00:19.550> now

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
hello my spearfishing community now

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.300 
hello my spearfishing community now
today<00:00:20.450> our<00:00:20.750> video<00:00:21.110> is<00:00:21.410> about<00:00:21.529> changing<00:00:22.189> a

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
today our video is about changing a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.390 
today our video is about changing a
flopper<00:00:23.500> different<00:00:24.500> divers<00:00:24.860> have<00:00:25.070> different

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
flopper different divers have different

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.179 
flopper different divers have different
reasons<00:00:25.580> for<00:00:25.820> changing<00:00:26.300> their<00:00:26.420> flopper

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
reasons for changing their flopper

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.190 
reasons for changing their flopper
some<00:00:28.189> prefer<00:00:28.580> them<00:00:28.880> on<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.090> total<00:00:29.480> others<00:00:30.110> on

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
some prefer them on the total others on

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.870 
some prefer them on the total others on
the<00:00:30.290> bottom

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
the bottom

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.760 
the bottom
sometimes<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.090> flopper<00:00:32.329> gets<00:00:32.599> damaged<00:00:32.989> but

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
sometimes the flopper gets damaged but

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.270 
sometimes the flopper gets damaged but
in<00:00:34.250> this<00:00:34.579> case<00:00:34.880> this<00:00:35.780> flopper<00:00:36.170> is<00:00:36.290> grabbing<00:00:37.070> on

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
in this case this flopper is grabbing on

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.850 
in this case this flopper is grabbing on
the<00:00:37.579> spear<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.420> I've<00:00:38.540> tried<00:00:38.840> listening<00:00:39.770> it

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
the spear and I've tried listening it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.850 
the spear and I've tried listening it
off<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.930> it's<00:00:41.930> not<00:00:42.079> working<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:42.590> I'm<00:00:42.649> get<00:00:42.829> a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
off and it's not working so I'm get a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.330 
off and it's not working so I'm get a
completely<00:00:43.520> remove<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.060> from<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.360> spear<00:00:45.340> so

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
completely remove it from the spear so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.970 
completely remove it from the spear so
the<00:00:46.460> tools<00:00:46.699> we'll<00:00:46.850> need<00:00:46.879> for<00:00:47.149> this<00:00:47.239> job<00:00:47.920> is<00:00:48.920> a

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
the tools we'll need for this job is a

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.250 
the tools we'll need for this job is a
foil<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.899> hammer<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.730> we<00:00:52.730> could<00:00:53.000> buy<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.480> pen<00:00:53.960> for

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
foil a hammer and we could buy a pen for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.900 
foil a hammer and we could buy a pen for
the<00:00:54.379> flopper<00:00:54.769> but<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:55.489> would<00:00:55.579> be<00:00:55.609> cheating

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
the flopper but that would be cheating

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.959 
the flopper but that would be cheating
so<00:00:56.269> what<00:00:56.539> I've<00:00:56.629> done<00:00:56.809> here<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.699> I've<00:00:58.699> bought

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
so what I've done here is I've bought

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.810 
so what I've done here is I've bought
bicycle<00:00:59.839> spoke<00:01:00.109> now<00:01:00.920> they<00:01:01.190> must<00:01:01.399> be<00:01:01.550> stainless

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
bicycle spoke now they must be stainless

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.270 
bicycle spoke now they must be stainless
don't<00:01:02.600> go<00:01:02.809> stealing<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.589> spokes<00:01:03.859> of<00:01:04.010> some

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
don't go stealing the spokes of some

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.640 
don't go stealing the spokes of some
poor<00:01:04.580> kids<00:01:04.820> bike<00:01:05.089> down<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.390> road<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:06.470> want<00:01:06.620> a

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
poor kids bike down the road you want a

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.530 
poor kids bike down the road you want a
brand<00:01:06.890> new<00:01:07.100> stainless<00:01:07.730> steel<00:01:07.760> spoke<00:01:08.270> and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
brand new stainless steel spoke and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.020 
brand new stainless steel spoke and
generally<00:01:09.440> speaking<00:01:09.800> they're<00:01:10.190> two<00:01:10.790> miles

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
generally speaking they're two miles

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.530 
generally speaking they're two miles
thick<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:13.190> what<00:01:13.370> we<00:01:13.490> first<00:01:13.820> need<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.300> is

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
thick so what we first need to do is

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.000 
thick so what we first need to do is
remove<00:01:14.930> that<00:01:15.520> flopper<00:01:16.520> from<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.480> sphere<00:01:17.750> and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
remove that flopper from the sphere and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.100 
remove that flopper from the sphere and
so<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:19.190> order<00:01:19.340> to<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.880> we<00:01:20.090> have<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.510> wear

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
so in order to do that we have to wear

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.160 
so in order to do that we have to wear
off<00:01:21.260> this<00:01:21.470> pin<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.190> head<00:01:22.750> grind<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.900> head<00:01:24.080> of

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
off this pin the head grind the head of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.600 
off this pin the head grind the head of
that<00:01:24.230> pin<00:01:24.290> off<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.220> should<00:01:25.370> fall

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
that pin off and then it should fall

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:52.230 
that pin off and then it should fall
through<00:01:25.850> without<00:01:26.090> too<00:01:26.330> much<00:01:26.450> trouble

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.760 

now<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.480> know<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:53.870> looked<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.350> just<00:01:54.410> got<00:01:54.740> a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
now I know that looked like I just got a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.090 
now I know that looked like I just got a
Phillips<00:01:55.280> screwdriver<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:56.420> use<00:01:56.960> as<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> punch

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
Phillips screwdriver to use as a punch

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.710 
Phillips screwdriver to use as a punch
but<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.580> was<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:58.730> an<00:01:59.210> optical<00:01:59.450> illusion

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
but that was just an optical illusion

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.080 
but that was just an optical illusion
BISM<00:02:00.380> no<00:02:01.100> way<00:02:01.400> I'll<00:02:01.550> do<00:02:01.700> such<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:01.940> horrible

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
BISM no way I'll do such a horrible

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.050 
BISM no way I'll do such a horrible
thing<00:02:02.450> love<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.920> next<00:02:04.220> we<00:02:04.430> have<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.670> cut<00:02:04.940> off

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
thing love it so next we have to cut off

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.870 
thing love it so next we have to cut off
this<00:02:05.240> threaded<00:02:05.900> part<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.530> spoke<00:02:07.040> because

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
this threaded part of the spoke because

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.300 
this threaded part of the spoke because
that<00:02:08.210> may<00:02:08.390> use<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.600> us<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.830> we've<00:02:15.980> cut<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.250> off

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that may use to us so we've cut it off

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.310 
that may use to us so we've cut it off
the<00:02:16.460> threaded<00:02:16.760> part<00:02:17.020> now<00:02:18.020> what<00:02:18.230> we

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the threaded part now what we

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.150 
the threaded part now what we
effectively<00:02:18.800> have<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.250> do<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.670> make<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:21.160> new

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
effectively have to do is make a new

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.270 
effectively have to do is make a new
head<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:24.080> not<00:02:24.200> going<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.770> as<00:02:24.890> wide<00:02:25.130> as

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
head it's not going to be as wide as

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.630 
head it's not going to be as wide as
this<00:02:26.020> but<00:02:27.020> hopefully<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.860> be<00:02:28.010> as<00:02:28.100> wide<00:02:28.400> enough

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
this but hopefully all be as wide enough

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.790 
this but hopefully all be as wide enough
to<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:30.200> slip<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.460> I'm<00:02:32.030> not<00:02:32.180> going<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.800> give

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
to not slip out so I'm not going to give

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.490 
to not slip out so I'm not going to give
this<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.040> really<00:02:34.280> good<00:02:34.310> beating<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:36.260> if

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
this a really good beating because if

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.170 
this a really good beating because if
you<00:02:36.590> do<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:37.070> you're<00:02:37.370> tend<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.820> collapse<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
you do that you're tend to collapse the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.330 
you do that you're tend to collapse the
spoke<00:02:41.180> onto<00:02:41.780> itself<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.410> what<00:02:42.890> we<00:02:43.010> want<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> do

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
spoke onto itself so what we want to do

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.420 
spoke onto itself so what we want to do
is<00:02:43.520> just<00:02:43.730> work<00:02:43.970> away<00:02:44.330> at<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.280> make<00:02:46.280> that

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
is just work away at it and make that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.130 
is just work away at it and make that
burr<00:02:46.640> over<00:02:47.030> nice<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.480> as<00:02:47.780> big<00:02:47.959> as<00:02:48.110> possible

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
burr over nice and as big as possible

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.550 
burr over nice and as big as possible
now<00:02:48.770> ideally<00:02:49.400> I'd<00:02:50.300> be<00:02:50.630> using<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.080> lot<00:02:51.230> smaller

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
now ideally I'd be using a lot smaller

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.000 
now ideally I'd be using a lot smaller
hammer<00:02:51.890> than<00:02:52.220> what<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.610> here<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:54.050> it's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
hammer than what I have here so it's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.530 
hammer than what I have here so it's
just<00:02:55.070> how<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.489> really<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.880> don't<00:02:56.030> have<00:02:56.360> any

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
just how it is really I don't have any

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.430 
just how it is really I don't have any
small<00:02:57.080> Amma's<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:57.620> yeah<00:02:58.280> some<00:02:58.520> nice<00:02:58.670> little

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
small Amma's but yeah some nice little

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:11.320 
small Amma's but yeah some nice little
kids<00:03:00.440> hammer<00:03:00.739> will<00:03:01.130> almost<00:03:01.250> be<00:03:01.630> perfect<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.610> as

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
kids hammer will almost be perfect so as

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.140 
kids hammer will almost be perfect so as
you<00:03:11.600> can<00:03:11.750> see<00:03:12.760> I'm<00:03:14.440> rolling<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.850> hammer<00:03:16.850> over

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
you can see I'm rolling the hammer over

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.410 
you can see I'm rolling the hammer over
so<00:03:18.140> you're<00:03:18.290> trying<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.590> bear<00:03:18.800> over<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.430> small

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
so you're trying to bear over a small

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.800 
so you're trying to bear over a small
amount<00:03:21.519> at<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.550> time

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
amount at a time

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:40.660 
amount at a time
I<00:03:38.650> don't<00:03:39.650> know<00:03:39.709> how<00:03:39.830> where<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:40.250> see<00:03:40.459> that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
I don't know how where you can see that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.080 
I don't know how where you can see that
but<00:03:41.530> barring<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.560> over<00:03:43.010> actually<00:03:43.550> took<00:03:43.790> like

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
but barring that over actually took like

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.960 
but barring that over actually took like
almost<00:03:44.989> four<00:03:45.410> minutes<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.890> just<00:03:46.489> steady

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
almost four minutes of just steady

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.199 
almost four minutes of just steady
hammering<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:48.470> there<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> very<00:03:49.700> stall

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
hammering now there is a very stall

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.440 
hammering now there is a very stall
every<00:03:50.360> slight<00:03:50.980> curve<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.459> pin<00:03:52.760> but<00:03:53.360> I'm

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
every slight curve in that pin but I'm

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.540 
every slight curve in that pin but I'm
not<00:03:53.569> too<00:03:53.720> worried<00:03:53.989> about<00:03:54.020> that<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:55.190> as<00:03:55.370> you'll

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
not too worried about that and as you'll

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.740 
not too worried about that and as you'll
see<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.260> perfect<00:03:57.709> size<00:03:58.390> pen<00:03:59.390> and

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
see it's the perfect size pen and

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.120 
see it's the perfect size pen and
diameter<00:04:00.370> for<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.519> spear<00:04:03.610> see<00:04:04.610> just<00:04:05.360> enough

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
diameter for the spear see just enough

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.620 
diameter for the spear see just enough
play<00:04:07.130> there<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.239> moves<00:04:08.480> around

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
play there so that it moves around

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.550 
play there so that it moves around
easily<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:10.130> now<00:04:10.310> what<00:04:10.459> we<00:04:10.580> do<00:04:10.760> can<00:04:11.720> we<00:04:11.870> get<00:04:12.410> that

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
easily so now what we do can we get that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.729 
easily so now what we do can we get that
pin<00:04:13.060> check<00:04:14.060> which<00:04:14.450> way<00:04:14.720> up<00:04:14.900> oh<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.500> other

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
pin check which way up oh the other

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.830 
pin check which way up oh the other
thing<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:16.070> I've<00:04:16.340> worked<00:04:17.030> on<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:17.239> flopper<00:04:17.540> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
thing is I've worked on this flopper so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.420 
thing is I've worked on this flopper so
that<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.109> not<00:04:18.290> grabbing<00:04:18.560> anymore<00:04:20.260> now

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
that it's not grabbing anymore now

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.840 
that it's not grabbing anymore now
myself<00:04:22.430> like<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.120> flop<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.660> top<00:04:24.850> so

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
myself like the flop is on the top so

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.780 
myself like the flop is on the top so
line<00:04:26.450> this<00:04:26.630> up<00:04:27.910> feed<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.060> all<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.270> way<00:04:29.360> through

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
line this up feed it all the way through

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.840 
line this up feed it all the way through
now<00:04:31.790> we'll<00:04:32.000> be<00:04:32.180> cutting<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.990> off<00:04:35.110> leaving

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
now we'll be cutting it off leaving

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.340 
now we'll be cutting it off leaving
might<00:04:37.850> give<00:04:38.000> us<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.210> bit<00:04:38.390> ourselves<00:04:39.110> about

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
might give us a bit ourselves about

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.430 
might give us a bit ourselves about
three<00:04:39.650> or<00:04:39.800> four<00:04:39.979> millimeters<00:04:40.550> proud<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:42.140> that

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
three or four millimeters proud so that

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.350 
three or four millimeters proud so that
you've<00:04:43.100> got<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.340> bit<00:04:43.520> of<00:04:43.550> middle<00:04:43.880> there<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.210> be

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
you've got a bit of middle there to be

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.600 
you've got a bit of middle there to be
Rover<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:47.150> I'll<00:04:47.270> get<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.510> marker

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.100 

this<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.759> a<00:04:52.789> bit<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.090> chunky<00:04:53.419> marker<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:53.900> I'm

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
this is a bit of a chunky marker so I'm

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.200 
this is a bit of a chunky marker so I'm
going<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.650> make<00:04:55.160> sure<00:04:55.190> that<00:04:55.759> the<00:04:55.850> line<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.060> put

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
going to make sure that the line I put

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:16.719 
going to make sure that the line I put
on<00:04:56.479> there<00:04:56.690> gets<00:04:56.870> cut<00:04:57.110> off<00:05:00.400> like<00:05:01.400> so<00:05:14.169> okay<00:05:15.729> put

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
on there gets cut off like so okay put

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.150 
on there gets cut off like so okay put
it<00:05:16.880> down<00:05:16.910> there<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:20.570> view<00:05:21.560> as<00:05:21.680> flat<00:05:22.009> as

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
it down there this view as flat as

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.939 
it down there this view as flat as
possible<00:05:23.199> make<00:05:24.199> sure<00:05:24.380> you've<00:05:24.560> got<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.710> nice

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
possible make sure you've got a nice

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.820 
possible make sure you've got a nice
solid<00:05:25.669> surface<00:05:25.990> get<00:05:26.990> realistic<00:05:29.560> again<00:05:30.560> we<00:05:30.710> go

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
solid surface get realistic again we go

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.760 
solid surface get realistic again we go
through<00:05:31.009> the<00:05:31.099> same<00:05:31.340> process<00:05:31.789> again<00:05:31.940> of<00:05:32.300> just

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
through the same process again of just

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.360 
through the same process again of just
beating<00:05:33.770> it<00:05:33.889> lightly<00:05:34.240> now<00:05:35.919> if<00:05:36.919> you<00:05:37.190> hit<00:05:37.310> too

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
beating it lightly now if you hit too

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.659 
beating it lightly now if you hit too
hard<00:05:37.520> one<00:05:38.300> hit<00:05:38.509> you<00:05:38.690> can<00:05:38.960> actually<00:05:39.139> bow<00:05:39.669> the

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
hard one hit you can actually bow the

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.050 
hard one hit you can actually bow the
spoke<00:05:41.000> wallet<00:05:41.710> inside<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:43.430> end<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.759> curve

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
spoke wallet inside the end of the curve

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.480 
spoke wallet inside the end of the curve
inside<00:05:44.900> actual<00:05:45.289> pin<00:05:46.360> so<00:05:47.360> again<00:05:48.460> we're<00:05:49.460> just

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
inside actual pin so again we're just

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.680 
inside actual pin so again we're just
going<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.820> take<00:05:50.060> our<00:05:50.210> time<00:05:52.270> I'll<00:05:53.270> skip<00:05:53.570> this

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
going to take our time I'll skip this

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.270 
going to take our time I'll skip this
process<00:05:53.870> otherwise<00:05:54.470> you'll<00:05:54.770> get<00:05:54.919> bored<00:05:55.099> out

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
process otherwise you'll get bored out

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.670 
process otherwise you'll get bored out
of<00:05:55.310> your<00:05:55.460> tree<00:05:55.840> okay<00:05:56.840> that's<00:05:57.320> pretty<00:05:57.500> much

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
of your tree okay that's pretty much

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.339 
of your tree okay that's pretty much
finished<00:05:58.099> I<00:05:58.820> do<00:05:59.210> think<00:05:59.659> I<00:05:59.750> could<00:06:00.020> have<00:06:00.110> got<00:06:00.320> a

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
finished I do think I could have got a

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.839 
finished I do think I could have got a
slightly<00:06:00.909> better<00:06:01.909> looking<00:06:02.449> finish<00:06:03.159> if<00:06:04.159> I<00:06:04.669> had

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
slightly better looking finish if I had

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.779 
slightly better looking finish if I had
a<00:06:04.880> smaller<00:06:05.210> hammer<00:06:05.419> a<00:06:06.340> small<00:06:07.340> hammer<00:06:07.550> with<00:06:07.760> a

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
a smaller hammer a small hammer with a

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.719 
a smaller hammer a small hammer with a
more<00:06:08.419> of<00:06:08.479> a<00:06:08.570> curve<00:06:08.780> on<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> head<00:06:09.610> what<00:06:10.610> I'm

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
more of a curve on the head what I'm

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.140 
more of a curve on the head what I'm
finding<00:06:11.090> is<00:06:11.330> that<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.599> head<00:06:11.870> is<00:06:12.620> flat<00:06:13.010> and<00:06:13.250> you

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
finding is that the head is flat and you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.029 
finding is that the head is flat and you
start<00:06:14.449> bouncing<00:06:14.960> against<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.409> flopper<00:06:15.710> while

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
start bouncing against the flopper while

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.110 
start bouncing against the flopper while
you're<00:06:16.159> trying<00:06:16.400> to<00:06:16.460> put<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.699> pressure<00:06:16.940> on

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
you're trying to put the pressure on

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.839 
you're trying to put the pressure on
that<00:06:17.300> pin<00:06:17.770> but<00:06:18.770> I'm<00:06:18.889> happy<00:06:19.580> enough<00:06:19.669> that

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
that pin but I'm happy enough that

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.969 
that pin but I'm happy enough that
that's<00:06:20.120> going<00:06:20.360> to<00:06:20.419> hold<00:06:20.599> well<00:06:20.930> it's<00:06:21.650> not<00:06:21.800> going

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
that's going to hold well it's not going

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.070 
that's going to hold well it's not going
to<00:06:22.070> slide<00:06:22.280> out<00:06:22.520> and<00:06:22.789> it<00:06:23.300> is<00:06:23.419> still<00:06:23.750> plenty<00:06:24.050> of

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
to slide out and it is still plenty of

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.320 
to slide out and it is still plenty of
strength<00:06:24.409> in<00:06:24.590> there<00:06:24.740> now<00:06:25.370> as<00:06:25.610> you<00:06:25.729> can<00:06:25.880> see<00:06:26.090> the

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
strength in there now as you can see the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.320 
strength in there now as you can see the
flopper<00:06:27.289> is<00:06:28.099> not<00:06:28.310> grabbing<00:06:28.699> on<00:06:28.940> that<00:06:29.090> sphere

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
flopper is not grabbing on that sphere

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.499 
flopper is not grabbing on that sphere
but<00:06:29.690> what<00:06:29.870> I<00:06:29.900> do<00:06:30.020> want<00:06:30.289> is<00:06:30.940> that<00:06:31.940> when<00:06:32.060> I<00:06:32.150> strike

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
but what I do want is that when I strike

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:37.880 
but what I do want is that when I strike
the<00:06:32.539> spear<00:06:33.020> with<00:06:33.349> that<00:06:33.590> it<00:06:34.340> stays<00:06:35.150> up<00:06:35.360> by<00:06:35.479> this

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.130 

I'll<00:06:38.340> be<00:06:38.550> covering<00:06:38.880> that<00:06:39.060> in<00:06:39.360> another<00:06:39.540> video

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
I'll be covering that in another video

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.380 
I'll be covering that in another video
all<00:06:41.130> right<00:06:41.310> there<00:06:41.520> we<00:06:41.610> have<00:06:41.640> a<00:06:42.260> 1u<00:06:43.260> pin<00:06:44.390> the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
all right there we have a 1u pin the

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.820 
all right there we have a 1u pin the
only<00:06:45.570> extra<00:06:46.020> tool<00:06:46.200> that<00:06:46.350> I<00:06:46.380> need<00:06:46.530> really

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
only extra tool that I need really

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.560 
only extra tool that I need really
needed<00:06:47.130> was<00:06:47.340> the<00:06:49.730> punch<00:06:50.730> that<00:06:51.390> looks

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
needed was the punch that looks

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.840 
needed was the punch that looks
extremely<00:06:52.170> similar<00:06:52.560> to<00:06:53.250> a<00:06:53.400> Phillips

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
extremely similar to a Phillips

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.890 
extremely similar to a Phillips
screwdriver<00:06:54.920> so<00:06:55.920> there<00:06:56.220> we<00:06:56.340> go<00:06:56.490> just

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
screwdriver so there we go just

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.840 
screwdriver so there we go just
something<00:06:57.900> to<00:06:58.170> keep<00:06:59.010> in<00:06:59.130> mind<00:06:59.340> if<00:06:59.580> you<00:06:59.700> get

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
something to keep in mind if you get

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.120 
something to keep in mind if you get
caught<00:07:00.120> out<00:07:00.240> somewhere<00:07:00.720> and<00:07:00.750> I<00:07:01.200> just<00:07:01.950> wanted

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
caught out somewhere and I just wanted

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.910 
caught out somewhere and I just wanted
to<00:07:02.190> show<00:07:02.460> you<00:07:02.720> the<00:07:03.720> job<00:07:03.960> done<00:07:04.230> with<00:07:04.380> a<00:07:04.410> bicycle

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
to show you the job done with a bicycle

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.210 
to show you the job done with a bicycle
spoke<00:07:05.010> because<00:07:05.430> accessibility<00:07:06.090> of<00:07:06.720> these

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
spoke because accessibility of these

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.390 
spoke because accessibility of these
will<00:07:08.220> always<00:07:08.460> be<00:07:08.670> well<00:07:09.030> generally<00:07:09.540> be<00:07:09.810> a<00:07:09.840> lot

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
will always be well generally be a lot

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.030 
will always be well generally be a lot
easier<00:07:11.400> than<00:07:11.940> finding<00:07:12.300> two<00:07:13.290> millimeter<00:07:13.800> pin

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
easier than finding two millimeter pin

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.770 
easier than finding two millimeter pin
for<00:07:14.370> a<00:07:14.400> flopper<00:07:14.730> I<00:07:14.970> hope<00:07:15.180> you<00:07:15.330> enjoy<00:07:15.600> that

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
for a flopper I hope you enjoy that

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.310 
for a flopper I hope you enjoy that
