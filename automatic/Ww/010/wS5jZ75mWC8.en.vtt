00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
back to this other note location next to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.600 
back to this other note location next to
the<00:01:24.240> side<00:01:25.049> room<00:01:25.380> buy<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.009> building<00:01:26.430> right

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the side room buy this building right

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
the side room buy this building right
next<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> spaceship<00:01:27.540> crash<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.110> whatever

next to the spaceship crash or whatever
it<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> there's<00:01:29.850> another<00:01:30.090> loop<00:01:30.299> right

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it is and there's another loop right

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.740 
it is and there's another loop right
there<00:01:31.939> now<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:35.579> reason<00:01:35.729> why<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.509> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
there now the reason why I like this is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
there now the reason why I like this is
I<00:01:36.869> told<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.799> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> launch

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
I told you is because a lot of launch

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.120 
I told you is because a lot of launch
respond<00:01:38.909> by<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.680> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> quick<00:01:41.070> way

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
respond by here and it's a quick way

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880 
respond by here and it's a quick way
just<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> level<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
just to level up as well so this is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
just to level up as well so this is
probably<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> best<00:01:44.579> levels<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.119> but

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
probably one of the best levels as but

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
probably one of the best levels as but
it<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.229> once<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.860> do<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> after<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> while<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it can once you do it after a while I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.289 
it can once you do it after a while I
mean<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.689> kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> boring<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
mean it can get kind of boring but I

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.580 
mean it can get kind of boring but I
mean<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.530> made

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
mean that's what that's what it's made

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.460 
mean that's what that's what it's made
for<00:01:52.710> isn't<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.840> level<00:01:55.380> up

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
for isn't it if you want it level up

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.190 
for isn't it if you want it level up
quick<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.799> learn<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.600> quick<00:01:57.600> amount<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> cash

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
quick and learn a quick amount of cash

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.330 
quick and learn a quick amount of cash
and<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.899> next<00:02:01.079> location<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> loot

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and so the next location of the loot

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.719 
and so the next location of the loot
crate<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.880> i<00:02:03.360> already<00:02:03.570> showed<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> two<00:02:04.729> will

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.710 
locations inside the cave like it will
be<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:16.080> next

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
be there or next

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
be there or next
in<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.530> front<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> entranceway

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
in the front of it in the entranceway

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.300 
in the front of it in the entranceway
it's<00:02:20.820> different<00:02:21.820> every<00:02:22.270> time<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
it's different every time and so the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.580 
it's different every time and so the
next<00:02:24.520> location<00:02:24.940> will<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.570> going<00:02:26.140> inside<00:02:26.410> this

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
next location will be going inside this

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.790 
next location will be going inside this
a<00:02:26.650> spaceship<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.440> have<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.650> kill

of the volute crates it will be in this

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.240 
of the volute crates it will be in this
very<00:04:12.910> northern<00:04:13.239> cave<00:04:13.930> or<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.070> back

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
yeah that'll be the last location for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.400 
yeah that'll be the last location for
the<00:04:24.040> loop<00:04:24.190> Creek

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
the loop Creek

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.520 
the loop Creek
and<00:04:26.410> as<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.729> said<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.509> great<00:04:29.199> way<00:04:29.470> to

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
and as I said this is a great way to

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.040 
and as I said this is a great way to
level<00:04:30.039> up<00:04:30.280> as<00:04:30.400> well<00:04:32.849> all<00:04:33.849> right<00:04:33.970> another<00:04:34.720> great

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
level up as well all right another great

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.620 
level up as well all right another great
reason<00:04:35.380> why<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.190> such<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.400> good<00:04:38.669> egg<00:04:39.669> place

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
reason why this is such a good egg place

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.110 
reason why this is such a good egg place
