this<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> tutorial<00:00:01.079> for<00:00:01.290> Mangum's<00:00:01.800> mingle

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
this is a tutorial for Mangum's mingle

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.039 
this is a tutorial for Mangum's mingle
it<00:00:03.120> should<00:00:03.330> look<00:00:03.480> something<00:00:03.540> like<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:06.049> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
it should look something like this the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:07.970 
it should look something like this the
first<00:00:07.170> thing<00:00:07.350> I'll<00:00:07.440> have<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.620> notice<00:00:07.859> about

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
first thing I'll have you notice about

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.040 
first thing I'll have you notice about
this<00:00:08.189> pattern<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:09.660> if<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.870> keep<00:00:09.990> your

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
this pattern is that if you keep your

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.700 
this pattern is that if you keep your
eye<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:11.460> bulb<00:00:12.170> you'll<00:00:13.170> see<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
eye on this bulb you'll see that the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070 
eye on this bulb you'll see that the
bulb<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.549> goes<00:00:14.610> around<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.360> stays<00:00:15.809> towards

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
bulb that goes around and stays towards

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
bulb that goes around and stays towards
the<00:00:16.139> top<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.500> pattern<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.130> always<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the top of the pattern is always the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.640 
the top of the pattern is always the
same<00:00:17.789> one

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
same one

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.200 
same one
I'll<00:00:19.650> call<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.890> one<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> top<00:00:20.430> ball<00:00:20.640> are

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
I'll call that one the top ball are

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.900 
I'll call that one the top ball are
quite<00:00:21.449> your<00:00:21.660> sake<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:23.189> start<00:00:23.400> off<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> pattern

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
quite your sake to start off the pattern

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.070 
quite your sake to start off the pattern
it<00:00:24.060> will<00:00:24.150> start<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.510> two<00:00:24.720> balls<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.050> your

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it will start with two balls in your

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080 
it will start with two balls in your
right<00:00:25.289> hand<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.949> left<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> your

right hands basically just going to do
three<00:00:28.470> normal<00:00:28.830> throws<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> rolling<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.670> two

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
three normal throws of rolling out two

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.920 
three normal throws of rolling out two
and<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.390> hand<00:00:30.570> pattern<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.590> three

go straight up into a clock edge from

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
go straight up into a clock edge from
this<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:13.170> should<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:16.790> okay<00:01:18.409> to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
hand is going to be throwing one more
time<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> throw<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.810> once<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.530> once

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
time so you throw it once here and once

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
time so you throw it once here and once
here<00:01:26.210> now<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> source<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> send<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> up

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
going to want to make sort of a triangle

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
going to want to make sort of a triangle
emotion<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.820> throw<00:01:57.090> both<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> balls

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
emotion as you throw both of the balls

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.190 
emotion as you throw both of the balls
at<00:01:57.810> once<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.250> moment<00:02:00.079> should<00:02:01.079> get

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
at once so in this moment should get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.670 
at once so in this moment should get
kind<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.500> triangle<00:02:01.740> effect<00:02:02.159> momentarily

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
kind of a triangle effect momentarily

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.580 
kind of a triangle effect momentarily
okay<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.890> also<00:02:05.610> unfortunately<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:07.229> pattern

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
okay and also unfortunately this pattern

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.180 
okay and also unfortunately this pattern
is<00:02:07.740> kind<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.039> awkward<00:02:08.220> even<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> get

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
is kind of awkward even when you get

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.460 
is kind of awkward even when you get
right<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.970> feels<00:02:10.390> sort<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.869> wrong<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.410> you

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
right it feels sort of wrong and you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.570 
right it feels sort of wrong and you
might<00:02:11.620> slip<00:02:11.770> into<00:02:11.950> something<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.370> Mills

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
might slip into something like a Mills

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.400 
might slip into something like a Mills
mess<00:02:12.790> which<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.000> much<00:02:13.210> flow<00:02:13.450> your<00:02:13.660> window<00:02:14.260> or

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
mess which is much flow your window or

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.440 
mess which is much flow your window or
something<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:15.880> advise<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.270> keep

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
something so I would advise you to keep

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240 
something so I would advise you to keep
in<00:02:16.540> mind<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.290> top<00:02:17.560> all<00:02:17.740> it's<00:02:17.890> always<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
in mind that the top all it's always the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.630 
in mind that the top all it's always the
same

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
same

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.850 
same
so<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.300> cover<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.750> keep<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.350> mind<00:02:20.620> that's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
so as you cover this keep in mind that's

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.890 
so as you cover this keep in mind that's
all<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:22.000> soon<00:02:22.180> as<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.360> catch<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.720> going<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
all as soon as you catch it's going to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.180 
all as soon as you catch it's going to
go<00:02:22.960> around<00:02:23.050> again<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.740> go<00:02:23.830> back<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.160> other

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
go around again and go back the other

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.990 
go around again and go back the other
direction

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.760 

that's<00:02:28.000> Magnum<00:02:28.330> angle<00:02:28.630> straight<00:02:29.530> one<00:02:29.650> more

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
that's Magnum angle straight one more

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.950 
that's Magnum angle straight one more
fun
