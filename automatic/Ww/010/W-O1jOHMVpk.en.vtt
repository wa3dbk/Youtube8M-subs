scars now acting results as a result of

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.820 
scars now acting results as a result of
pores<00:00:13.559> being<00:00:13.860> blocked<00:00:14.250> by<00:00:15.500> sebum<00:00:16.500> which<00:00:16.529> is

oil dirt it can be hairs dead skin and
then<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.619> happens<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.100> when<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> area

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
then what happens is when that area

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.509 
then what happens is when that area
becomes<00:00:24.029> infected<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:25.109> body<00:00:25.410> sends<00:00:26.039> white

result of the healing process a scar
conform<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.669> depends<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> size<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.899> the

all<00:00:36.960> these<00:00:37.110> impurities<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> times

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
all these impurities but a lot of times

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
all these impurities but a lot of times
it<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.420> form<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.230> deep<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it can form and it can be very deep the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.459 
it can form and it can be very deep the
one<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.059> probably<00:00:42.300> most<00:00:42.719> familiar<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
one that was probably most familiar to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.220 
one that was probably most familiar to
us<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> pits<00:00:44.280> car<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:45.420> happens<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.079> we

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
us is the pits car what happens is we

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.400 
us is the pits car what happens is we
get<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.410> loss<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.920> tissue<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.300> area<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
get a loss of tissue in that area and it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920 
get a loss of tissue in that area and it
causes<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.800> depression<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> skin<00:00:51.000> there

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
causes a depression in the skin there

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
causes a depression in the skin there
can<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.590> things<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
can be a lot of things that we can do to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.630 
can be a lot of things that we can do to
take<00:00:54.149> care<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:55.039> one<00:00:56.039> thing<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.489> do

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
take care of that one thing you can do

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.049 
take care of that one thing you can do
is<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.449> injected<00:00:57.949> by<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.370> collagen<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
is have it injected by with collagen and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.630 
is have it injected by with collagen and
that<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.109> help<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> does<00:01:01.739> fade<00:01:02.340> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that will help but it does fade so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.920 
that will help but it does fade so
that's<00:01:02.969> something<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> would<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that's something that you would have to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800 
that's something that you would have to
continue<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:05.339> back<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.420> maintenance

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
continue to go back and have maintenance

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
continue to go back and have maintenance
treatments<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.430> also<00:01:08.580> have

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
treatments you can also have

dermabrasion dermabrasion uses a file on
the<00:01:13.590> end<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> wand<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.960> machine

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the end of a wand really and a machine

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
the end of a wand really and a machine
rotates<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.340> fast<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.820> smooths

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
rotates it really fast and it smooths

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.070 
rotates it really fast and it smooths
out<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> skin<00:01:19.280> because<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.549> depression

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
out the skin because of that depression

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
out the skin because of that depression

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it and that's what makes it so apparent

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
it and that's what makes it so apparent
so<00:01:27.330> having<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> dermabrasion<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:29.070> even

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so having that dermabrasion or even

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
so having that dermabrasion or even
laser<00:01:29.759> works<00:01:30.180> well<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:31.049> smooth<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> skin<00:01:31.829> out

makes that scar less apparent there are
also<00:01:34.560> treatments<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
also treatments that you can do that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210

scars<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> those

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
scars and what that is is one of those

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
scars and what that is is one of those
scars<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.899> makes<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.470> bump

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829

it's a smooth raised bump and that's
really<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> build<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> collagen<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.479> skin

and<00:01:55.079> an<00:01:55.170> effort<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> heal<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.070> sends<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and an effort to heal it sends that

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.770 
and an effort to heal it sends that
collagen<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> makes<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.649> nice<00:01:58.860> nice<00:01:59.820> bump<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
collagen and makes a nice nice bump of a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.289 
collagen and makes a nice nice bump of a
scar<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.320> again<00:02:02.009> dermabrasion<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.850> great<00:02:03.090> for

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
scar and again dermabrasion is great for

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.959 
scar and again dermabrasion is great for
that<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.649> also<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:05.070> injected<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
that it can also be injected with a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.710 
that it can also be injected with a
steroid<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.890> works<00:02:08.160> too<00:02:08.459> there's<00:02:09.360> also<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
steroid so that works too there's also a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.229 
steroid so that works too there's also a
type<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.020> scar<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.370> creates<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.090> little

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
type of scar that it creates a little

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.580 
type of scar that it creates a little
dark<00:02:12.569> spot<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> red

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
dark spot or a red

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.339 
dark spot or a red
spot<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.879> get<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.810> seems<00:02:16.050> like

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
spot and that we get a lot it seems like

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.369 
spot and that we get a lot it seems like
now<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.040> happens<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.989> have<00:02:19.230> an

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
now what happens there is you have an

now what happens there is you have an
acne<00:02:19.769> lesion<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.209> go<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
acne lesion and then we go out in the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.160 
acne lesion and then we go out in the
Sun<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> Sun<00:02:23.280> causes<00:02:23.849> like<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> trauma<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
Sun and the Sun causes like a trauma to

Sun and the Sun causes like a trauma to
the<00:02:25.200> lesion<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.400> therefore<00:02:26.670> get<00:02:27.120> what's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the lesion and you therefore get what's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.380 
the lesion and you therefore get what's
