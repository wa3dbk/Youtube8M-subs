they're not feeling very well doing so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.810 
they're not feeling very well doing so
so<00:00:29.940> main<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.550> lot

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so main thing is is that you know a lot

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.410 
so main thing is is that you know a lot
there<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.930> people<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:35.039> eat

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
there are people out there that do eat

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.319 
there are people out there that do eat
raw<00:00:36.420> beans<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.559> legumes<00:00:37.679> and<00:00:38.339> what<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.269> do

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
raw beans and legumes and what they do

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
raw beans and legumes and what they do
is<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.749> soak<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.289> in<00:00:40.379> water<00:00:40.589> and<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.670> they

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is they soak them in water and then they

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.419 
is they soak them in water and then they
sprout<00:00:42.210> them<00:00:42.449> okay<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> helps<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> break

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
sprout them okay and this helps to break

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.779 
sprout them okay and this helps to break
you<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.819> little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.359> but<00:00:46.489> it's<00:00:47.489> still

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you down a little bit but it's still

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.229 
you down a little bit but it's still
quite<00:00:48.149> tough<00:00:48.539> okay<00:00:49.229> and<00:00:49.530> still<00:00:50.280> quite<00:00:50.609> starchy

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
quite tough okay and still quite starchy

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.259 
quite tough okay and still quite starchy
and<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:53.069> be<00:00:53.249> very<00:00:53.519> difficult<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.089> digest

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
and it can be very difficult to digest

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.479 
and it can be very difficult to digest
that<00:00:54.780> most<00:00:55.019> people<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.319> recommend<00:00:55.769> not<00:00:55.829> eating

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that most people I recommend not eating

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
that most people I recommend not eating
them<00:00:56.639> okay<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.420> most<00:00:57.809> people<00:00:58.079> can't

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
them okay because most people can't

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.309 
them okay because most people can't
really<00:00:58.589> digest<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.459> and<00:00:59.659> and<00:01:00.659> you<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
really digest them and and you know and

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.979 
really digest them and and you know and
I<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:02.190> someone<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.879> needs<00:01:03.179> like

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I really if someone really needs like

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
I really if someone really needs like
you<00:01:04.229> know<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.979> cannot<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.519> without

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you know they just cannot do without

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
you know they just cannot do without
their<00:01:06.330> their<00:01:06.960> chickpeas<00:01:07.440> or<00:01:07.740> their<00:01:07.860> lentils

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
their their chickpeas or their lentils

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
their their chickpeas or their lentils
or<00:01:08.580> their<00:01:09.150> legumes<00:01:09.690> or<00:01:09.840> their<00:01:09.960> beans<00:01:10.230> then<00:01:10.740> my

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
or their legumes or their beans then my

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.700 
or their legumes or their beans then my
suggestion<00:01:11.280> would<00:01:11.550> be<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> soak<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:13.020> sprout

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
suggestion would be to soak them sprout

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.790 
suggestion would be to soak them sprout
them<00:01:13.980> and<00:01:14.190> then<00:01:14.610> cook<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> would<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
them and then cook them I would not you

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.740 
them and then cook them I would not you
know<00:01:16.890> unless<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.520> you've<00:01:17.790> eaten<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
know unless you you've eaten them on a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
know unless you you've eaten them on a
regular<00:01:19.170> basis<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.710> you've<00:01:19.800> had<00:01:19.980> never<00:01:20.400> any

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
regular basis and you've had never any

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.590 
regular basis and you've had never any
problems<00:01:21.060> eating<00:01:21.480> raw<00:01:22.440> beans<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:23.040> legumes

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600

people<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.870> have<00:01:31.020> problems<00:01:31.230> digesting<00:01:31.920> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
people do have problems digesting it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
people do have problems digesting it
okay<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.790> very<00:01:33.320> difficult<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.440> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
okay it could be very difficult on the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
okay it could be very difficult on the
digestive<00:01:35.100> system<00:01:35.130> difficult<00:01:35.940> breakdown

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
digestive system difficult breakdown

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.800 
digestive system difficult breakdown
difficult<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.910> break<00:01:39.600> down<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
difficult to to just break down and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.680 
difficult to to just break down and
assimilate<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.910> know<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.120> don't

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
assimilate and so you know you don't

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.910 
assimilate and so you know you don't
want<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.900> be<00:01:42.960> eating<00:01:43.290> things<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.590> make<00:01:43.800> you

eating them with fruit well there's two

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.649 
eating them with fruit well there's two
reasons<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.280> first<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.820> all<00:01:56.970> if<00:01:57.180> you're

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
reasons for that first of all if you're

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.149 
reasons for that first of all if you're
ever<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.350> eating<00:01:59.150> any<00:02:00.150> kind<00:02:00.510> of<00:02:00.540> beans

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
ever to be eating any kind of beans

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.280 
ever to be eating any kind of beans
even<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.280> whether<00:02:02.760> they're<00:02:03.030> raw<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.780> even<00:02:04.200> if

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
