00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
play some facing stuff with the
different<00:00:13.500> channels<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.910> XXL<00:00:15.450> has

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
different channels that the the XXL has

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.420 
different channels that the the XXL has
of<00:00:16.230> course<00:00:16.440> I'm<00:00:16.619> not<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.100> go<00:00:17.190> through

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
of course I'm not going to go through

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.859 
of course I'm not going to go through
all<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.480> would<00:00:18.600> take<00:00:18.750> hours

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
all of it because it would take hours

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.750 
all of it because it would take hours
there's<00:00:19.380> tons<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.010> stuff<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.640> with

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
there's tons of stuff you can do with

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.150 
there's tons of stuff you can do with
this<00:00:20.880> amplifier<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.680> we're<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> do

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
this amplifier so what we're going to do

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.540 
this amplifier so what we're going to do
is<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> start<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:25.310> clean<00:00:31.430> as<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
is we're going to start out clean as you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
is we're going to start out clean as you
can<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.329> green<00:00:33.570> light<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> off

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
can see the green light is on and off

00:00:34.469 --> 00:01:05.440 
can see the green light is on and off
far<00:00:34.860> right<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:36.149> screen<00:00:36.690> there

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.480 

as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
as you can see as you can see that is a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.359 
as you can see as you can see that is a
pretty<00:01:09.180> clean<00:01:09.479> Channel<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.650> gonna<00:01:10.830> go<00:01:11.009> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
pretty clean Channel I'm gonna go and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:41.890 
pretty clean Channel I'm gonna go and
get<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.270> dirtier<00:01:12.659> here

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.990 

that's<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.200> bit<00:01:43.350> dirtier<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> now

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that's a little bit dirtier one and now

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
that's a little bit dirtier one and now
we're<00:01:45.180> gonna<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.509> something<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.079> bit

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
we're gonna do something a little bit

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.480 
we're gonna do something a little bit
more<00:01:48.079> lead<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:51.649> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.830> see<00:01:53.009> there's<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> lot

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
more lead like you can see there's a lot

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.340 
more lead like you can see there's a lot
of<00:01:53.610> presents<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.110> going

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of presents there and as you going

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.630 
of presents there and as you going
through<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.680> video<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.039> can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
through this video you can see the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.580 
through this video you can see the
different<00:01:57.360> indicators<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:58.020> changing<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
different indicators are changing on the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440 
different indicators are changing on the
amp<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.700> tell<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
amp so you can tell that this is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.240 
amp so you can tell that this is
definitely<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.080> amp<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.920> all<00:02:02.039> date

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
definitely the amp this is all date

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:41.220 
definitely the amp this is all date
stamped<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.729> course<00:02:02.970> on<00:02:03.539> my<00:02:03.840> ultimate

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.390 

why<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.349> uh<00:02:42.439> sustained<00:02:42.830> with<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.129> samp

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
why it's uh sustained with the samp

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.009 
why it's uh sustained with the samp
there's<00:02:43.970> nothing<00:02:44.360> wrong<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.780> at<00:02:44.840> all

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
there's nothing wrong with it at all

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.059 
there's nothing wrong with it at all
it's<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.819> freaking<00:02:46.819> awesome<00:02:47.030> camp<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.920> can

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
it's a freaking awesome camp and you can

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.179 
it's a freaking awesome camp and you can
actually<00:02:49.750> mix<00:02:50.750> some<00:02:51.049> things<00:02:51.319> together<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.159> just

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
actually mix some things together I just

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.740 
actually mix some things together I just
what<00:02:55.189> appears<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.579> be<00:02:56.739> my<00:02:57.739> effects<00:02:58.190> loop<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
what appears to be my effects loop and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.180 
what appears to be my effects loop and
of<00:02:59.750> course<00:02:59.989> I<00:03:00.049> don't<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.319> much<00:03:00.620> right<00:03:00.799> of<00:03:00.920> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
of course I don't have much right of the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:47.990 
of course I don't have much right of the
way

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.370 

anyway<00:03:49.000> as<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.420> can<00:03:49.570> tell<00:03:49.810> all<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.080> channels

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
anyway as you can tell all the channels

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.160 
anyway as you can tell all the channels
work<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:51.400> using<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.880> foot<00:03:52.120> switch<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.720> change

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
work I'm using the foot switch to change

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.750 
work I'm using the foot switch to change
those<00:03:53.410> indicators<00:03:53.830> on<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.190> front<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.550> amp

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
those indicators on the front of the amp

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.970 
those indicators on the front of the amp
I<00:03:55.290> really<00:03:56.290> hate<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.470> get<00:03:56.680> rid<00:03:56.740> of<00:03:56.860> this

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
I really hate to get rid of this

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.970 
I really hate to get rid of this
amplifier<00:03:57.340> because<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.210> versatile<00:03:59.200> but

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
amplifier because it is so versatile but

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.310 
amplifier because it is so versatile but
you<00:04:00.910> know<00:04:01.030> like<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:01.690> say<00:04:01.930> when<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.680> picked<00:04:03.280> up

when I picked up I had that PV Windsor

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.640 
when I picked up I had that PV Windsor
right<00:04:08.260> there<00:04:08.470> which<00:04:08.650> was<00:04:08.830> my<00:04:08.980> staple<00:04:09.460> amp<00:04:09.670> and
