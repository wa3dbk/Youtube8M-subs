00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
much the soccer teams in Burundi are

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.670 
much the soccer teams in Burundi are
made<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.720> both<00:03:55.200> Hutu<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.950> Tutsi<00:03:57.230> people<00:03:58.230> so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
made up of both Hutu and Tutsi people so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.290 
made up of both Hutu and Tutsi people so
they're<00:03:58.830> inter-ethnic<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.610> that's<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
they're inter-ethnic and that's the

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.240 
they're inter-ethnic and that's the
essential<00:04:00.540> conflict<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.410> Burundi<00:04:01.830> is<00:04:01.950> between

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
essential conflict in Burundi is between

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.940 
essential conflict in Burundi is between
the<00:04:02.370> Hutus<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.880> tootsies<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:04.680> became

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
the Hutus and the tootsies it became

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.880 
the Hutus and the tootsies it became
clear<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.340> us<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.639> these<00:04:06.269> soccer<00:04:06.989> games

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
clear to us that these soccer games

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.370 
clear to us that these soccer games
way<00:04:08.190> for<00:04:08.550> people<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.450> get<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.960> know<00:04:09.990> each<00:04:10.230> other

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
way for people to get to know each other

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.130 
way for people to get to know each other
as<00:04:10.530> individuals<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.900> transcend<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
as individuals and to transcend the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.530 
as individuals and to transcend the
ethnic<00:04:13.410> differences<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:15.090> think<00:04:15.330> that's

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
ethnic differences and I think that's

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.030 
ethnic differences and I think that's
where<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> real<00:04:15.900> passion<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:16.829> work

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
where the real passion for this work

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.729 
where the real passion for this work
came<00:04:17.370> from<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.940> seeing<00:04:18.239> soccer<00:04:18.600> as<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> tool<00:04:19.350> for

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
came from is seeing soccer as a tool for

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.600 
came from is seeing soccer as a tool for
reconciliation<00:04:20.670> and<00:04:21.329> peace<00:04:21.390> building<00:04:22.320> I

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
reconciliation and peace building I

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.890 
reconciliation and peace building I
think<00:04:23.610> that's<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.850> lot<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.030> where<00:04:24.330> our<00:04:24.360> energy

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
think that's a lot of where our energy

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.830 
think that's a lot of where our energy
came<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.380> growing<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:26.060> think<00:04:27.060> one<00:04:27.450> uniform

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
came for growing it I think one uniform

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.670 
came for growing it I think one uniform
can<00:04:28.770> make<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:28.980> difference<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:30.350> some<00:04:31.350> people

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
can make a difference for some people

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.909 
can make a difference for some people
maybe<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:32.490> doesn't<00:04:32.940> or<00:04:33.270> for<00:04:34.110> American<00:04:34.650> they

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
maybe it doesn't or for American they

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.230 
maybe it doesn't or for American they
don't<00:04:35.100> think<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.520> does<00:04:35.669> but<00:04:36.030> for

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
don't think that it does but for

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.600 
don't think that it does but for
Burundian<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.590> does<00:04:38.900> uniforms<00:04:39.900> can<00:04:40.400> help<00:04:41.400> them
