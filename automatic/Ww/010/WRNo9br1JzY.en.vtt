amplification my name is Brett and I'm
just<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> show<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.970> latest<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.480> fire

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
just going to show you the latest a fire

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.600 
just going to show you the latest a fire
built<00:00:10.099> this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.480> Fender<00:00:12.480> champ<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
built this is a Fender champ and it's a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.060 
built this is a Fender champ and it's a
chance<00:00:14.880> circuit<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.480> fuses<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.049> treble<00:00:16.980> in

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
chance circuit that fuses the treble in

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.090 
chance circuit that fuses the treble in
a<00:00:17.160> base<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.609> there's<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:17.940> bit<00:00:18.060> more<00:00:19.100> tone

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
a base so there's a little bit more tone

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.120 
a base so there's a little bit more tone
circuit<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:24.650> built<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.890> just

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
circuit in it and it's built I just

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.450 
circuit in it and it's built I just
thrown<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.519> into<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> box<00:00:27.269> had<00:00:27.599> laying<00:00:27.840> around<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
thrown it into a box had laying around I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.550 
thrown it into a box had laying around I
did<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> previous<00:00:29.910> video<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.439> had<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
did a previous video that had it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.229 
did a previous video that had it
originally<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> box<00:00:32.399> hooked<00:00:32.579> horrible<00:00:33.059> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
originally in the box hooked horrible so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.080 
originally in the box hooked horrible so
I<00:00:33.270> tried<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.660> clean<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.530> bit

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
I tried to clean it up a little bit

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.430 
I tried to clean it up a little bit
anyway<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.480> want<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> show<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
anyway I just want to show you how the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.069 
anyway I just want to show you how the
ants<00:00:37.770> am<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.300> straight<00:00:39.930> through

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
ants am I'm it's going straight through

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
ants am I'm it's going straight through
a<00:00:42.079> Holy<00:00:43.079> Grail<00:00:43.200> reverb<00:00:43.770> pedal<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.940> into

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a Holy Grail reverb pedal and then into

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
a Holy Grail reverb pedal and then into
the<00:00:45.300> ant<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> amp<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.230> reverb<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the ant the amp is in that reverb but

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
the ant the amp is in that reverb but
that's<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.270> only<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.289> through<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that's all it's only going through a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.049 
that's all it's only going through a
reverb<00:00:49.920> pedal<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.520> I'll<00:00:50.640> take<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
reverb pedal and then I'll take the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
reverb pedal and then I'll take the
reverb<00:00:51.329> pedal<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.750> taking<00:00:52.079> hear<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> straight

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
reverb pedal off taking hear it straight

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770 
reverb pedal off taking hear it straight
into<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> amp<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> I'm<00:00:54.120> playing<00:00:54.329> through<00:00:54.629> an

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
into the amp and I'm playing through an

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.450 
into the amp and I'm playing through an
SG<00:00:55.289> copy<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> i'll<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.620> give<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.430> few

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
SG copy and so i'll just give you a few

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.119 
SG copy and so i'll just give you a few
tones<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.120> show<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.480> it'll<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:01.129> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
tones to show you what it'll do and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:45.300 
tones to show you what it'll do and
right<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.699> i'm<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:02.910> both<00:01:03.629> pickups

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.590 

Oh

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.279 

Oh

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:09.400 

so<00:01:56.289> now<00:01:56.439> I'll<00:01:56.560> go<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:57.100> bridge<00:01:57.369> pickup<00:01:57.850> only

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:19.540 

and<00:02:10.150> now<00:02:11.150> we'll<00:02:11.300> go<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.750> next<00:02:11.960> victim

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.040 

and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.810 

you<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.470> see<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.920> volume<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.430> only<00:02:24.580> at<00:02:24.790> about

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
you can see the volume is only at about

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.910 
you can see the volume is only at about
a<00:02:25.060> quarter<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.200> trebles<00:02:26.620> about

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
a quarter the trebles about

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.380 
a quarter the trebles about
three-quarter<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.760> bases<00:02:28.180> all<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> way<00:02:28.600> up

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
three-quarter the bases all the way up

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.760 
three-quarter the bases all the way up
what<00:02:31.390> I'll<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.690> I'll<00:02:31.960> turn<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> bit

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
what I'll do is I'll turn it up a bit

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.030 
what I'll do is I'll turn it up a bit
and<00:02:33.300> we'll<00:02:34.300> get<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> bit<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.170> growl<00:02:35.440> out<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.950> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and we'll get a bit of a growl out of it

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:49.460 
and we'll get a bit of a growl out of it
and<00:02:36.700> i'll<00:02:37.390> be<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.950> neck<00:02:38.950> sorry<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.910> bridge

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.990 

and<00:02:50.470> i'll<00:02:50.620> take<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.920> reverb<00:02:51.220> us<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:51.730> now<00:02:51.850> we're

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
and i'll take the reverb us so now we're

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.600 
and i'll take the reverb us so now we're
just<00:02:52.030> going<00:02:52.210> straight<00:02:52.780> into<00:02:53.050> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.180 

and<00:03:06.610> then<00:03:07.090> we'll<00:03:07.390> give<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> bit<00:03:08.170> more<00:03:08.410> grunt<00:03:08.830> and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and then we'll give a bit more grunt and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.250 
and then we'll give a bit more grunt and
we'll<00:03:09.430> turn<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.640> up<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.090> about<00:03:10.180> three<00:03:11.020> quarters

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
we'll turn it up to about three quarters

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.130 
we'll turn it up to about three quarters
of<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.620> way<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:12.310> I'm<00:03:12.880> still<00:03:13.210> on<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.780> bridge

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
of the way and I'm still on the bridge

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:35.190 
of the way and I'm still on the bridge
pickup

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220 

so<00:03:36.200> that's<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:36.710> a<00:03:37.040> little<00:03:37.580> bit<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:38.230> display

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
so that's just a little bit of a display

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.780 
so that's just a little bit of a display
of<00:03:39.260> what<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> amp<00:03:39.800> will<00:03:39.980> do<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.340> claims<00:03:40.610> are

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
of what the amp will do the claims are

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.910 
of what the amp will do the claims are
really<00:03:41.060> nice<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.260> when<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.740> turn

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
really nice on it and and when you turn

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.470 
really nice on it and and when you turn
it<00:03:42.950> up<00:03:43.190> it<00:03:43.340> really<00:03:43.550> does<00:03:43.730> have<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> quite<00:03:44.450> a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
it up it really does have a quite a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.300 
it up it really does have a quite a
decent<00:03:44.780> distortion<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.710> it<00:03:47.710> from<00:03:48.710> Pearson

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
decent distortion to it from Pearson

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.810 
decent distortion to it from Pearson
amplification<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.090> thanks<00:03:50.600> for<00:03:50.780> watching
