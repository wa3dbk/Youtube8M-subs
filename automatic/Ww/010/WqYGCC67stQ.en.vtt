time your last coat should be right
around<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.440> bead<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.670> gives<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.910> a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
around the bead and that gives you a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.550 
around the bead and that gives you a
nice<00:01:40.090> thick<00:01:40.390> bead<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:40.869> when<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.110> peel<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.470> off

nice thick bead so when you peel it off

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.740 
nice thick bead so when you peel it off
the<00:01:41.710> tire<00:01:41.890> later<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:43.030> don't<00:01:43.180> tear<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.420> off<00:01:43.570> the

it's<00:01:54.790> uh<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.560> works<00:01:57.250> out<00:01:57.399> for<00:01:57.520> me

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's uh it works out for me

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.920 
it's uh it works out for me
so<00:01:59.200> one<00:01:59.380> layer<00:01:59.530> done<00:01:59.740> all<00:02:00.610> right<00:02:00.670> two<00:02:01.660> layers

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
so one layer done all right two layers

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.290 
so one layer done all right two layers
down<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.930> probably<00:02:05.550> gonna<00:02:06.550> go<00:02:06.729> through<00:02:06.940> three

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
down I'm probably gonna go through three

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.800 
down I'm probably gonna go through three
cans<00:02:08.050> three<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.530> half<00:02:08.619> cans<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.130> finish<00:02:09.340> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
cans three and half cans to finish this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.250 
cans three and half cans to finish this
but<00:02:12.450> start<00:02:13.450> kind<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.690> seeing<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.050> look<00:02:16.260> three

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
but start kind of seeing the look three

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.110 
but start kind of seeing the look three
thirty<00:02:17.470> years<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.550> last<00:02:18.760> time

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
thirty years and just like last time

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.390 
thirty years and just like last time
about<00:02:19.870> halfway<00:02:20.050> through<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.440> project<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
about halfway through the project and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.250 
about halfway through the project and
the<00:02:21.940> wind<00:02:22.120> kicks<00:02:22.360> but<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.930> we<00:02:26.019> should<00:02:26.170> be

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the wind kicks but I think we should be

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.340 
the wind kicks but I think we should be
alright<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:28.209> getting<00:02:28.480> there<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.110> want

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
alright it's getting there I just want

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.539 
alright it's getting there I just want
to<00:02:29.410> make<00:02:29.500> sure<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.830> put<00:02:29.890> enough<00:02:30.160> coats<00:02:30.370> on

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
to make sure that I put enough coats on

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.330 
to make sure that I put enough coats on
since<00:02:31.420> these<00:02:31.959> will<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.320> down<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.890> all<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
since these will be down with all the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.979 
since these will be down with all the
rocks<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.880> gravel<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.260> nasty<00:02:35.739> stuff<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.989> I'll

rocks and gravel and nasty stuff so I'll

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.979 
rocks and gravel and nasty stuff so I'll
do<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> few<00:02:38.650> more<00:02:38.739> layers<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.870> we'll<00:02:40.870> keep

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
do a few more layers here and we'll keep

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.870 
do a few more layers here and we'll keep
going<00:02:41.070> all<00:02:42.070> right<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> said<00:02:42.459> three<00:02:42.700> layers

going all right you said three layers

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.509 
going all right you said three layers
down<00:02:43.110> ten<00:02:44.110> minutes<00:02:44.410> between<00:02:44.530> layers<00:02:44.860> or

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
down ten minutes between layers or

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
layers done what I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.640 
layers done what I'm gonna go ahead and
do<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.060> am<00:02:49.239> actually<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.840> roll<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650

do is I am actually going to roll the
car<00:02:50.920> forward<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.780> see<00:02:52.930> if<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.080> can<00:02:53.170> get<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
car forward and see if I can get the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.590 
car forward and see if I can get the
bottom<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.070> wheel<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> top<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.480> make

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
bottom of the wheel to the top and make

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:06.030 
bottom of the wheel to the top and make
sure<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.780> get<00:02:56.019> all<00:02:56.200> angles<00:03:04.739> here<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:05.829> are<00:03:05.860> with

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
sure I get all angles here we are with

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.150 
sure I get all angles here we are with
five<00:03:06.310> layers<00:03:06.610> complete<00:03:07.650> after<00:03:08.650> rolling<00:03:08.860> car

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
five layers complete after rolling car

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.690 
five layers complete after rolling car
forward<00:03:09.579> I<00:03:09.910> did<00:03:10.450> find<00:03:10.780> some<00:03:11.590> thin<00:03:11.769> spots<00:03:12.100> as<00:03:12.340> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
forward I did find some thin spots as I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.960 
forward I did find some thin spots as I
suspected<00:03:13.329> but<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.540> fixed<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
suspected but I fixed it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.370 
suspected but I fixed it
so<00:03:15.090> we're<00:03:15.270> just<00:03:15.300> gonna<00:03:15.480> let<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.750> dry<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
so we're just gonna let this dry and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.700 
so we're just gonna let this dry and
then<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.280> will<00:03:18.140> clean<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.260> all<00:03:19.350> up

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
then we will clean it all up

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.370 
then we will clean it all up
Oh<00:03:20.000> last-second<00:03:21.000> decision<00:03:21.060> before<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.630> start

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
Oh last-second decision before I start

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.990 
Oh last-second decision before I start
pulling<00:03:22.770> all<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.160> overspray<00:03:23.670> off<00:03:23.700> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
pulling all the overspray off and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.880 
pulling all the overspray off and
everything<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.480> went<00:03:25.140> ahead<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.530> threw<00:03:25.710> some

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
everything I went ahead just threw some

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.390 
everything I went ahead just threw some
gloss<00:03:26.160> fire<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.610> there<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.330> leftover<00:03:28.400> I

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
gloss fire on there it's a leftover I

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.670 
gloss fire on there it's a leftover I
didn't<00:03:30.300> think<00:03:30.390> matte-black<00:03:30.870> look<00:03:31.200> too<00:03:31.380> good

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.660 

figured<00:03:34.680> I'd<00:03:34.800> match<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> up<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.460> grill

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
figured I'd match it up with the grill

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.060 
figured I'd match it up with the grill
so<00:03:36.030> two<00:03:36.090> layers<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.690> gloss<00:03:37.260> fire<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
so two layers of gloss fire for the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.220 
so two layers of gloss fire for the
overspray<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.180> rubbed<00:03:39.390> one<00:03:39.540> spot<00:03:39.840> until<00:03:40.020> I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
overspray I just rubbed one spot until I

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.020 
overspray I just rubbed one spot until I
got<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.740> started<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:43.140> theory<00:03:44.030> this

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
got it started here and in theory this

00:03:45.030 --> 00:04:00.370 
got it started here and in theory this
should<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.360> peel<00:03:45.750> right<00:03:46.080> along<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.860> scene

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.980 

peel<00:04:01.380> center<00:04:01.680> caps<00:04:01.950> just<00:04:02.310> took<00:04:03.060> one<00:04:03.210> nail<00:04:03.420> dug

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
peel center caps just took one nail dug

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:12.590 
peel center caps just took one nail dug
into<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:05.160> piece<00:04:05.370> right<00:04:05.580> there<00:04:11.240> my<00:04:12.240> fingers

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
into that piece right there my fingers

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.820 
into that piece right there my fingers
you're<00:04:12.720> tired<00:04:12.930> from<00:04:13.140> spraying<00:04:13.440> that's<00:04:13.620> pretty
