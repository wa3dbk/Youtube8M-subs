 southern state of this southern region of our entity 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.230
 I am convinced as the kings the communications secretary 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.600
 that the only way to detonate to give more impetus to economic development 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 of the state 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.970
 this time the biggest army 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.560
 that is why I have committed myself throughout this management of this management 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.859
 We will be committed to developing 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.450
 greater road infrastructure 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.749
 bigger roads better roads rehabilitating the ones we already have 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.170
 modernizing them 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.200
 giving them the use of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.860
 maintenance and conservation of roads that the state has 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.720
 and on the other hand 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.910
 also introduce new mass transport systems especially in the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.989
 areas of greater agglomeration that our entity so much demands 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.430
 especially issues 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.400
 pillars 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.620
 and triggers of the economic security that we want to promote in the state of 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.990
 mexico that is a condition of the governor and my government 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.120
 for that reason we are working on marches 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 inns 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.689
 in an accelerated way 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.939
 why I can not help but recognize 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.639
 Beijing's work is to collaborate in the areas of the secretariat of 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.270
 communications and transport 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.219
 ceremonies in his honor 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.149
 at the local road board 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.569
 because they were 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.620
 certainly fear of the best effort 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.009
 in this effort 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.900
 and if it is true or collaborators and part of this government team 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.089
 we are in the same commitment 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:59.069
 we will see now 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.329
 just over five years four months ahead and the time I learned 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.969
 we have to work at an accelerated pace 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:13.180
 that allows us to really crystallize in results the commitments I assumed 30 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.899
 trains 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.340
 when I was a candidate 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.780
 to sign before a notary public and I think we are already working and fulfilling 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.779
 Between both 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.349
 fcc said they will be following throughout the session 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.590

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:40.600

 to give satisfactory and favorable solutions 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:00.800
 is in the dynamics of this government 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.419

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:03.939
 to this dynamic

 authorities with their municipal authority and with the state's own 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.759
