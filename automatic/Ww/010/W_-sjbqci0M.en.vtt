Mike<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.899> camera<00:00:40.290> imma<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.930> it's<00:00:42.930> right

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
Mike the camera imma show you it's right

Mike the camera imma show you it's right
over<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.750> be

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
over here so this is how it would be

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
over here so this is how it would be
installed<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> vehicle<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.399> course<00:00:47.430> because

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
installed on a vehicle of course because

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.049 
installed on a vehicle of course because
this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.480> two<00:00:48.809> sided<00:00:49.050> tape<00:00:49.620> side<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.820> up

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this is two sided tape side so going up

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
this is two sided tape side so going up
this<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.129> see<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> here's<00:00:54.559> my

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this way you see that this here's my

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
this way you see that this here's my
right<00:00:55.770> hand<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> left<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
right hand is on the left so it's a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.500 
right hand is on the left so it's a
reverse<00:00:57.210> image<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.370> advance<00:00:59.510> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
reverse image so know that in advance so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.470 
reverse image so know that in advance so
if<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> having<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.590> reversed<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.359> know

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
if this is having it reversed you know

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
if this is having it reversed you know
again<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> true<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
again so that way it's true as if you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.219 
again so that way it's true as if you
were<00:01:05.489> looking<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.060> yourself<00:01:06.229> it's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
were looking at it yourself it's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.210 
were looking at it yourself it's
important<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> make<00:01:07.920> sure<00:01:08.070> you're

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it is pioneer in pioneer you got a good

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.870 
it is pioneer in pioneer you got a good
amount<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.230> wire<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.590> I'd<00:02:31.890> say<00:02:32.130> about<00:02:32.310> 15<00:02:32.730> or

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
amount of wire here I'd say about 15 or

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.240 
amount of wire here I'd say about 15 or
17<00:02:33.000> feet<00:02:33.510> something<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.260> inline<00:02:35.040> fuse

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
17 feet something like that inline fuse

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.520 
17 feet something like that inline fuse
and<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:36.209> got<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.450> little<00:02:36.530> interpretation

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
and it's got this little interpretation

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.430 
and it's got this little interpretation
hub<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:39.330> if<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.570> need<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.900> unplug<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.350> for

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
hub so if you need to unplug it for

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.100 
hub so if you need to unplug it for
whatever<00:02:40.620> reason<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.840> an

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
whatever reason you can and this is an

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.170 
whatever reason you can and this is an
important<00:02:43.530> part<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.400> puzzle<00:02:44.610> without

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
important part of the puzzle without

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.699 
important part of the puzzle without
this<00:02:45.390> camera<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.050> simply<00:02:46.350> would<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.530> work

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
this camera just simply would not work

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.949 
this camera just simply would not work
and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.130> can't<00:02:48.030> even<00:02:48.209> screw<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.570> up<00:02:48.660> there's<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
and you can't even screw it up there's a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.449 
and you can't even screw it up there's a
four<00:02:49.170> pin<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.440> one<00:02:49.470> side<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> five<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.190> the

other and that's really all there is to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.710 
other and that's really all there is to
is<00:02:52.590> connecting<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.489> camera<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.480> since

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
pioneer camera polarity it says battery

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.860 
pioneer camera polarity it says battery
which<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.190> positive<00:03:20.700> positive<00:03:20.820> 12<00:03:21.209> volts<00:03:21.420> we

which is positive positive 12 volts we

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.180 
which is positive positive 12 volts we
could<00:03:22.019> have<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.140> ground<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.620> if<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.829> put<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
could have a ground so if you put the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.350 
could have a ground so if you put the
black<00:03:23.400> on<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.709> activation<00:03:26.489> camera<00:03:27.000> input

on<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:28.200> pioneer<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.799> had<00:03:28.950> 12<00:03:29.220> volts<00:03:29.459> going<00:03:29.670> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
on a pioneer and had 12 volts going to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.699 
on a pioneer and had 12 volts going to
the<00:03:29.880> red<00:03:30.030> all<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.269> time<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:31.320> ground<00:03:31.500> which

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the red all the time the ground which

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.770 
the red all the time the ground which
rigger<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.340> vice<00:03:32.910> versa<00:03:33.239> if<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.450> wanted

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
rigger this and vice versa if you wanted

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.569 
rigger this and vice versa if you wanted
it<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.930> have<00:03:34.170> positive<00:03:34.980> polarity<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.430> in

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
it to have positive polarity like in

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.729 
it to have positive polarity like in
most<00:03:35.670> vehicles<00:03:35.910> when<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.720> your<00:03:37.410> reverse

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
most vehicles when you have your reverse

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.610 
most vehicles when you have your reverse
lights<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.880> switch<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.090> 12<00:03:39.420> volts<00:03:39.720> while

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
lights that switch to 12 volts while

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.770 
lights that switch to 12 volts while
you're<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.860> reverse<00:03:41.220> gear<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:42.510> would<00:03:42.630> just

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
you're in reverse gear you would just

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.830 
you're in reverse gear you would just
have<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.049> set<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.500> polarity<00:03:44.600> battery<00:03:45.600> or

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
have it set to polarity battery or

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.630 
have it set to polarity battery or
positive<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.980> will<00:03:47.100> work<00:03:47.220> normal<00:03:47.549> you

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
positive and it will work normal you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.860 
positive and it will work normal you
just<00:03:47.760> add<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> black<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.299> ground<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:48.690> that's

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
just add the black to ground so that's

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.890 
just add the black to ground so that's
really<00:03:49.019> always<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.420> really<00:03:51.420> quick<00:03:51.630> not

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
really always to it so really quick not

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900 
really always to it so really quick not
a<00:03:51.930> big<00:03:52.110> deal<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:52.560> there's<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.860> NDB<00:03:53.220> c6<00:03:53.790> is

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
