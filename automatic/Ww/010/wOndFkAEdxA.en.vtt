00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
go ahead and plug it into the charger

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.550 
go ahead and plug it into the charger
here<00:02:19.350> because<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.770> didn't<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.430> 50%<00:02:21.380> or<00:02:22.380> more

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
here because I didn't have 50% or more

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:33.010 
here because I didn't have 50% or more
so<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:25.670> quick<00:02:26.670> note

opinion<00:02:40.820> because<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:43.770> go<00:02:43.920> ahead<00:02:44.010> and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
opinion because you you can go ahead and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.620 
opinion because you you can go ahead and
it's<00:02:46.710> just<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> minor<00:02:47.250> update<00:02:47.520> but<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.390> make

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
it's just a minor update but just make

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.240 
it's just a minor update but just make
sure<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.410> have<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.620> backup<00:02:50.040> in

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
sure you know you do have a backup in

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.660 
sure you know you do have a backup in
case<00:02:50.480> something<00:02:51.480> happens<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.830> are<00:02:53.100> things

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
case something happens there are things

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.430 
case something happens there are things
that<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:54.000> happen<00:02:54.210> through<00:02:54.540> through<00:02:55.110> updates

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that can happen through through updates

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.200 
that can happen through through updates
so<00:02:56.040> we'll<00:02:56.160> go<00:02:56.280> ahead<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.490> let<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.910> bar

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
so we'll go ahead and let this bar

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.280 
so we'll go ahead and let this bar
whoops

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
whoops

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.890 
whoops
man<00:02:58.980> let<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.340> bar<00:02:59.580> get<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.570> way<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
man let this bar get all the way to the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.200 
man let this bar get all the way to the
get<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.740> way<00:03:01.860> across<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.670> update<00:03:03.030> is

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
get all the way across the update is

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.510 
get all the way across the update is
also<00:03:03.630> about<00:03:03.840> thirty<00:03:04.200> five<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:04.830> believe<00:03:05.310> thirty

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
also about thirty five I believe thirty

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.120 
also about thirty five I believe thirty
five<00:03:05.700> megabytes<00:03:06.210> so<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:07.290> nice<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.770> not<00:03:07.890> big

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
five megabytes so it's nice it's not big

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.430 
five megabytes so it's nice it's not big
update<00:03:08.460> should<00:03:09.270> download<00:03:09.480> relatively<00:03:10.170> fast

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
update should download relatively fast

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.000 
update should download relatively fast
ice<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.900> line<00:03:12.900> has<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.440> crossed<00:03:13.710> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
ice so the line has just crossed and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.720 
ice so the line has just crossed and
it's<00:03:14.130> all<00:03:14.580> it's<00:03:15.360> completely<00:03:15.480> filled<00:03:15.930> now

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
it's all it's completely filled now

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.340 
it's all it's completely filled now
another<00:03:17.730> thing<00:03:17.820> I'd<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.360> know<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.810> just

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
another thing I'd like to know is just

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.000 
another thing I'd like to know is just
in<00:03:20.070> case<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.340> didn't<00:03:20.610> know<00:03:20.760> there<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.390> no

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
in case you didn't know there is no

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.000 
in case you didn't know there is no
untethered<00:03:23.010> jailbreak<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.700> iOS<00:03:23.970> 6<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.870> as<00:03:25.800> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
untethered jailbreak for iOS 6 and as of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.680 
untethered jailbreak for iOS 6 and as of
right<00:03:26.040> now<00:03:27.800> there<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.730> not<00:03:30.180> believe<00:03:30.450> there's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
right now there I do not believe there's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.000 
right now there I do not believe there's
any<00:03:30.930> jailbreak<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:32.120> software<00:03:33.120> update

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
any jailbreak for this software update

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.450 
any jailbreak for this software update
6.0.1<00:03:35.010> either<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:36.330> if<00:03:36.690> you're<00:03:36.870> running<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.460> 6.0

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
6.0.1 either so if you're running a 6.0

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.940 
6.0.1 either so if you're running a 6.0
and<00:03:38.750> there's<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.900> believe<00:03:40.260> there's<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.710> few

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
and there's I believe there's a few

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.970 
and there's I believe there's a few
tethered<00:03:41.340> jailbreak<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:42.420> are<00:03:42.540> out<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.320> you

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
tethered jailbreak that are out and you

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.950 
tethered jailbreak that are out and you
want<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.250> keep<00:03:44.370> your<00:03:44.460> jailbreak<00:03:44.790> don't<00:03:45.570> update

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
want to keep your jailbreak don't update

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.230 
want to keep your jailbreak don't update
to<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.500> because<00:03:47.070> there<00:03:47.370> isn't<00:03:47.610> one<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:48.090> far

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
to this because there isn't one as far

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.440 
to this because there isn't one as far
as<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.480> know<00:03:49.400> when<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.430> find<00:03:50.730> out<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.000> there's<00:03:51.240> one

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
as I know when I find out if there's one

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
now it I believe it's already installed

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.640 
now it I believe it's already installed
it<00:04:08.010> might<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:09.230> finishing<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
it might just be finishing the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.130 
it might just be finishing the
installation<00:04:10.860> process<00:04:11.490> or<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.870> through

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
installation process or going through

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.880 
installation process or going through
and<00:04:14.150> optimizing<00:04:15.150> things<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.530> got<00:04:16.680> another

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
and optimizing things but we got another

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.640 
and optimizing things but we got another
little<00:04:17.070> progress<00:04:17.850> bar<00:04:18.270> here<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:18.720> alright<00:04:19.590> so

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
little progress bar here so alright so

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.490 
little progress bar here so alright so
that<00:04:20.040> finished<00:04:20.400> pretty<00:04:20.880> fast<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.630> mean<00:04:22.320> here

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
that finished pretty fast I mean here

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.100 
that finished pretty fast I mean here
little<00:04:23.180> little<00:04:24.180> noise<00:04:24.330> saying<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.990> it's

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
little little noise saying that it's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.330

this a second and here we are so the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.340 
this a second and here we are so the
installation<00:04:34.440> process<00:04:34.890> went<00:04:35.340> smooth<00:04:36.350> there

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
installation process went smooth there

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.010 
installation process went smooth there
was<00:04:37.530> there<00:04:37.890> wasn't<00:04:38.040> too<00:04:38.310> much<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:39.960> that

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
was there wasn't too much going on that

iOS<00:04:55.610> 6.0.1<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.729> know<00:04:56.939> it's<00:04:57.090> hard<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.300> see<00:04:57.569> but<00:04:58.199> it

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
iOS 6.0.1 I know it's hard to see but it

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.059 
iOS 6.0.1 I know it's hard to see but it
does<00:04:58.469> say<00:04:58.620> iOS<00:04:58.979> 6.0.1<00:05:00.349> so<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.620> installation

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
does say iOS 6.0.1 so the installation

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.749 
does say iOS 6.0.1 so the installation
process<00:05:02.249> took<00:05:02.669> about<00:05:03.889> twelve<00:05:04.889> minutes<00:05:05.219> maybe

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
process took about twelve minutes maybe

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.739

twelve<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:07.430> twelve<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.909> maybe<00:05:09.240> fourteen

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:09.749 
twelve to twelve to maybe fourteen

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.820 
twelve to twelve to maybe fourteen
minutes<00:05:09.930> or<00:05:10.169> so<00:05:11.569> so<00:05:12.569> that's<00:05:13.229> it<00:05:13.499> that<00:05:13.680> was<00:05:13.800> just
