 Salom is stable 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 we are local for fear of reprisals 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.929
 so 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 looking for the mayor 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.470
 before the presumption that the meeting is 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.110
 probably as a year 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.420
 some time it was more difficult 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.110
 I suppressed them 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 then sr 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 francisco i madero arenga 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.300
 revolutionary cause 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 I what estrada

 the continuous to the circus working for the republic imagines 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.810
 They asked for the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.620
 aware of the circus 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.290
 then they touched 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.750
 was after having to found 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.860
 Girls 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 is not to say a firing squad 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.900
 olano 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.120
 26 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.900
 we crossed with one 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.480
 in central America 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.290
 and so start a bullet 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 the tour that lasted 20 years 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 the name of mexico 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.370
 it is very likely that it was the brothers attack 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.520
 who linked 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.070
 the imaginary 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 all South America 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 the image of the charro 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.739
 in response and without emotion to 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:12.929

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.759
 they presented themselves 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.549
 we touched changes 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.049
 Guillen finished 65 while in Brazil 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 important mexican alfonso reyes 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.559
 he signed 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.559
 and you are true ambassadors of mexico 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.929
 rather symbolic 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 If I do not live anymore 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.119
 two populations 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.119
 so that in reality the ambassadors 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.359
 in latin america are you 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.559
 efe - the twenty-seven 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.099
 his brother sata ii 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.519

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.289
 They travel to Europe and present a month of success 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.829
 in cities like Paris 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.049
 in Portugal 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.459
 limit 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.809
 I kill that until then they were unpublished in the old continent because which 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.359
 written in the guinness book of records because they made a luck 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.569
 from the first bar astrada 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.569
 doing two pirouettes 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.989
 in the next 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 unfortunately they have disappeared 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.929
 they are exercises 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.929
 very very demanding very demanding 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.049
 two businessmen 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.399
 then they started to be auctioned 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.479
 they came to have such pretensions that they were about to lose everything 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.509
 finally the matter was resolved 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.020
 and they had to return to South America because their father was 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.960
 they come back 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.779
 South America 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.259
 you will imagine 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.830
 the process then there 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 in years functions 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.840

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.349
 being in colombia 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.349
