00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.570 
have any boss monster set voltec which
makes<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.289> kind<00:05:51.560> of<00:05:51.680> weak<00:05:51.860> in<00:05:52.009> my<00:05:52.130> eyes<00:05:52.190> but

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
makes it kind of weak in my eyes but

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.980 
makes it kind of weak in my eyes but
it's<00:05:52.909> very<00:05:53.120> defensive<00:05:53.569> at<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.690> same<00:05:53.840> time

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
it's very defensive at the same time

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.260 
it's very defensive at the same time
this<00:05:54.169> one's<00:05:54.349> more<00:05:54.530> offensive<00:05:55.069> power<00:05:55.250> so<00:05:56.030> it

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
this one's more offensive power so it

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.300 
this one's more offensive power so it
just<00:05:56.419> depends<00:05:56.690> on<00:05:56.810> how<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:56.960> run<00:05:57.199> it<00:05:57.380> depends

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
just depends on how you run it depends

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.610 
just depends on how you run it depends
on<00:05:58.400> how<00:05:58.460> you<00:05:58.490> side<00:05:58.729> but<00:05:59.690> I<00:05:59.900> like<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.139> SEC<00:06:00.380> a<00:06:00.409> lot

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
on how you side but I like the SEC a lot

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.950
