everything<00:01:42.090> made<00:01:42.240> out<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.600> first<00:01:42.720> time

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
everything made out for the first time

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.440 
everything made out for the first time
and<00:01:43.340> go<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> start<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> sprites<00:01:45.240> here

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and go and start with the sprites here

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.000 
and go and start with the sprites here
alright<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.620> is<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.980> a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
alright so this is going to be a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.340 
alright so this is going to be a
player's<00:01:47.370> right<00:01:47.670> simple<00:01:48.210> white<00:01:48.630> box<00:01:48.930> kind<00:01:49.260> of

thing and my blocks right or basically

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.890 
thing and my blocks right or basically
my<00:01:52.800> ground<00:01:53.190> which<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.300> civil<00:01:54.570> black

I'm<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.470> picking<00:01:58.620> up<00:01:58.800> now<00:01:59.010> this

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I'm going to be picking up now this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'm going to be picking up now this
could<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> rock<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.180> whatever<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.780> heck<00:02:00.900> you

could be a rock or whatever the heck you
want<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.620> just<00:02:02.130> goes<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:03.000> simple

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
want to be I just goes a little simple

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.600 
want to be I just goes a little simple
brown<00:02:03.750> crate<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.710> well<00:02:05.100> simple

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
brown crate because it was well simple

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.160 
brown crate because it was well simple
and<00:02:05.729> easy<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.150> fast<00:02:06.690> just<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.860> editorial

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and easy and fast just for the editorial

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.999 
and easy and fast just for the editorial
but<00:02:10.170> yeah<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> could<00:02:10.500> definitely<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.830> ahead

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
but yeah I could definitely go ahead

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.910 
but yeah I could definitely go ahead
through<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.030> choose<00:02:12.530> basically<00:02:13.530> change<00:02:13.740> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
through and choose basically change this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.449 
through and choose basically change this
right

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
right

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.010 
right
once<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.240> everything<00:02:15.300> already<00:02:15.780> coated

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
once you have everything already coated

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.150 
once you have everything already coated
out

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
out

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.770 
out
but<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.300> close<00:02:18.600> this

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
but for now it's going just close this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.410 
but for now it's going just close this
hit<00:02:19.020> okay<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:19.970> basically<00:02:20.970> what<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.120> did<00:02:21.180> is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
hit okay and now basically what I did is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.320 
hit okay and now basically what I did is
I<00:02:21.510> went<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.410> made<00:02:22.920> objects<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.880> all<00:02:24.120> three

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
I went in and made objects of all three

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.360 
I went in and made objects of all three
of<00:02:24.390> those<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.840> let's<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.620> go<00:02:25.830> ahead<00:02:25.920> really

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
of those and let's just go ahead really

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
of those and let's just go ahead really
quickly<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.330> player<00:02:27.720> object<00:02:27.990> all

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
quickly and go to the player object all

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.650 
quickly and go to the player object all
right<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> have<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> step<00:02:29.970> event<00:02:30.270> here<00:02:30.480> which

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
right so I have a step event here which

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.360 
right so I have a step event here which
basically<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.200> sets<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.560> gravity<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
basically just sets my gravity for the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.100 
basically just sets my gravity for the
player<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.540> need<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:33.959> this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
player and you need to have this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.990 
player and you need to have this
sorority<00:02:34.470> upper<00:02:34.860> back<00:02:35.310> sorry<00:02:35.640> if<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.880> already

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
sorority upper back sorry if you already

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.510 
sorority upper back sorry if you already
have<00:02:36.300> gravity<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.350> your<00:02:37.470> player<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
have gravity for your player and the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.060 
have gravity for your player and the
next<00:02:38.730> name<00:02:38.850> digit<00:02:39.150> was<00:02:39.240> go<00:02:39.360> at<00:02:39.510> event<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
next name digit was go at event and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.430 
next name digit was go at event and
collision<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.310> my<00:02:41.459> block<00:02:41.850> or<00:02:42.450> my<00:02:42.810> ground<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
collision with my block or my ground and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.050 
collision with my block or my ground and
basically<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.310> said<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> collision<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:44.820> that

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
basically just said a collision for that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.510 
basically just said a collision for that
and<00:02:45.270> note<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.140> wouldn't<00:02:46.650> try<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.920> copy<00:02:47.220> me

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
and note I wouldn't try to copy me

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520 
and note I wouldn't try to copy me
because<00:02:47.970> I'm<00:02:48.540> basically<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.140> tutorial

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
press or added a key press space now

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.280 
press or added a key press space now
this<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.760> important<00:03:18.239> part<00:03:18.420> here<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
this is the important part here and the

you need to have that but you know it's

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.370 
you need to have that but you know it's
a<00:03:25.920> pretty<00:03:26.280> cool<00:03:26.489> thing<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.790> guess<00:03:26.940> AB<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:28.230> you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
a pretty cool thing I guess AB if you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.539 
a pretty cool thing I guess AB if you
really<00:03:28.590> want<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.920> bring<00:03:29.100> out<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> potential

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
really want to bring out the potential

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.130 
really want to bring out the potential
its<00:03:29.820> tutorial<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.690> if<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.840> already<00:03:31.019> have

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
its tutorial but if you already have

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.780 
its tutorial but if you already have
that<00:03:31.290> then<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.830> don't<00:03:31.920> need<00:03:32.070> what<00:03:32.250> these<00:03:32.430> but

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
that then you don't need what these but

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.280 
that then you don't need what these but
shouldn't<00:03:33.180> these<00:03:33.450> anyway<00:03:33.750> because<00:03:33.930> they're

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
shouldn't these anyway because they're

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.410 
shouldn't these anyway because they're
again<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.280> for<00:03:35.430> toriel<00:03:35.820> purposes<00:03:36.239> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
again just for toriel purposes and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.930 
again just for toriel purposes and
pretty<00:03:37.140> messy<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.040> anyway<00:03:38.370> back<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.610> what<00:03:38.820> we

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
pretty messy so anyway back to what we

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.259 
pretty messy so anyway back to what we
need<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.239> do<00:03:39.360> um<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.010> basically<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.700> space<00:03:41.970> is

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
need to do um so basically the space is

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.120 
need to do um so basically the space is
what<00:03:43.110> button<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.739> you're<00:03:43.830> going<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.070> able

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
what button that you're going to be able

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.880 
what button that you're going to be able
to<00:03:44.220> press<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:45.120> basically<00:03:45.600> pick<00:03:45.989> up<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.440> object

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
to press to basically pick up the object

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.120 
to press to basically pick up the object
or<00:03:47.730> in<00:03:48.060> our<00:03:48.360> case<00:03:48.390> pick<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> crate<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.100> I

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
or in our case pick up the crate so I

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.710 
or in our case pick up the crate so I
just<00:03:50.400> put<00:03:50.549> space<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.180> change<00:03:51.510> this

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
just put space but you can change this

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720 
just put space but you can change this
to<00:03:51.780> whatever<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.500> want<00:03:52.680> after<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.100> finish

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
you don't really need to do that unless

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.360 
you don't really need to do that unless
you<00:05:48.310> know<00:05:48.750> actually<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:49.810> kind<00:05:49.990> of<00:05:50.050> do

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
basically your ground object needs to be

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.570 
basically your ground object needs to be
solid<00:05:52.780> but<00:05:53.710> most<00:05:53.889> likely<00:05:54.130> probably<00:05:54.280> already

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
solid but most likely probably already

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.490
