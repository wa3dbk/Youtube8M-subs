on<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.649> yourself<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.579> any<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:50.820> way<00:00:50.850> so

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
on for yourself but any which way so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
on for yourself but any which way so
this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.920> new<00:00:53.129> map<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:54.230> foundation<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this is the new map of foundation and so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
this is the new map of foundation and so
far<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:56.940> maps<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> my

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
far out of the two maps this is my

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.430 
far out of the two maps this is my
favorite<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.750> decent<00:01:01.379> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
favorite and the other one is decent but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
favorite and the other one is decent but
it's<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it's just not it's not actually I and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.780 
it's just not it's not actually I and
I'm<00:01:04.409> not<00:01:04.589> gonna<00:01:04.710> let<00:01:04.799> me<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
I'm not gonna let me like it at all so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
I'm not gonna let me like it at all so
far<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.330> maybe<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.439> don't

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
far but maybe it's just because I don't

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
far but maybe it's just because I don't
have<00:01:07.710> any<00:01:07.890> strategies<00:01:08.400> yet<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:08.850> assuming

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
have any strategies yet and I'm assuming

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420 
have any strategies yet and I'm assuming
that's<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.710> no<00:01:10.950> idea<00:01:10.979> where

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that's what it is I have no idea where

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.600 
that's what it is I have no idea where
the<00:01:11.549> spawns<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.510> confusing<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.409> way

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the spawns are it's so confusing the way

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.830 
the spawns are it's so confusing the way
everything<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> laid<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> can't<00:01:15.630> tell

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
everything is laid out that I can't tell

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
everything is laid out that I can't tell
where<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> enemy<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
where the enemy is going to be at and it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.789 
where the enemy is going to be at and it
makes<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.270> difficult<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.259> play<00:01:19.500> when

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
makes it really difficult to play when

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
makes it really difficult to play when
you're<00:01:20.430> getting<00:01:20.790> flanked<00:01:21.240> from<00:01:21.390> everywhere

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you're getting flanked from everywhere

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
you're getting flanked from everywhere
getting<00:01:21.990> killed<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.950> map<00:01:23.159> however<00:01:23.640> if

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
getting killed so this map however if

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060 
getting killed so this map however if
you<00:01:24.060> notice<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.650> towards<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you notice this is kind of towards the a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.850 
you notice this is kind of towards the a
flag<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.970> map<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> crazy<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
flag and this map is kind of crazy it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
flag and this map is kind of crazy it's
really<00:01:29.100> easy<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:30.240> least<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.570> myself<00:01:30.659> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
really easy to at least for myself just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
really easy to at least for myself just
start<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.740> predict<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> spawns<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.210> just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
start off to predict the spawns you just

were getting new tube a lot a long time
ago<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.260> remember<00:03:19.560> running<00:03:19.680> into<00:03:19.829> him<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299

and he raged quit out and our team was

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.490 
and he raged quit out and our team was
horrible<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> we<00:03:24.569> end<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:24.930> losing<00:03:25.260> miserably

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
horrible and we end up losing miserably

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.920 
horrible and we end up losing miserably
but<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.849> uh<00:03:26.879> but<00:03:27.239> anyway<00:03:27.480> let's<00:03:27.629> get<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
but but uh but anyway let's get in the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.539 
but but uh but anyway let's get in the
map<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.109> little<00:03:28.349> bit<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.340> me<00:03:29.519> looks

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
map a little bit so this to me looks

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.990 
map a little bit so this to me looks
like<00:03:29.970> rust<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:31.139> crack<00:03:31.889> like<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.699> kind<00:03:32.879> of

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
like rust on crack like it kind of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.650 
like rust on crack like it kind of
reminds<00:03:33.269> me<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.480> rust<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.010> way<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
reminds me of rust just the way that the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.610 
reminds me of rust just the way that the
industrial<00:03:36.660> look<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:40.049> buildings<00:03:40.440> and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
industrial look of the the buildings and

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.750 
industrial look of the the buildings and
stuff<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:40.980> there's<00:03:41.129> so<00:03:41.250> many<00:03:41.340> little<00:03:41.549> nooks

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
stuff and there's so many little nooks

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.339 
stuff and there's so many little nooks
and<00:03:41.940> crannies<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.449> know<00:03:42.720> how<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:42.930> rust<00:03:43.199> you

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
and crannies you know how on rust you

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.629 
and crannies you know how on rust you
can<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.919> can<00:03:44.069> climb<00:03:44.220> up<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.519> middle

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
can you can climb up the middle

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.960 
can you can climb up the middle
stairwell<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.449> then<00:03:46.519> get<00:03:47.519> up<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.940> top

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
stairwell and then get up to the top

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.699 
stairwell and then get up to the top
area<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:48.840> there's<00:03:49.079> little<00:03:49.290> cubbyholes

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
area and then there's little cubbyholes

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.439 
area and then there's little cubbyholes
you<00:03:49.919> can<00:03:50.069> crawl<00:03:50.310> through<00:03:50.609> that's<00:03:51.060> what<00:03:51.329> it

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
you can crawl through that's what it

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.879 
you can crawl through that's what it
kind<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.900> reminds<00:03:52.199> me<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.620> middle<00:03:52.739> of

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
kind of reminds me of in the middle of

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:53.960 
kind of reminds me of in the middle of
this<00:03:53.010> map<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.430> can<00:03:53.579> see<00:03:53.699> right<00:03:53.730> here

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
this map and you can see right here

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.939 
this map and you can see right here
here's<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.660> spawn<00:03:54.989> spot<00:03:55.290> again<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.799> just

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
here's that spawn spot again so you just

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.649 
here's that spawn spot again so you just
gotta<00:03:56.160> watch<00:03:56.370> yourself<00:03:56.549> when<00:03:57.389> you're<00:03:57.540> in

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
gotta watch yourself when you're in

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.819 
gotta watch yourself when you're in
their<00:03:57.870> spawn<00:03:58.260> they're<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.709> coming

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
their spawn they're going to be coming

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.770 
their spawn they're going to be coming
around<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.790> should<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.120> doubled<00:04:00.599> back<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
around and I should be doubled back and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.099 
around and I should be doubled back and
turn<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.290> around<00:04:01.379> now<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.000> checking<00:04:03.000> my

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
turn it around now and checking my

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.099 
turn it around now and checking my
backside<00:04:04.109> because<00:04:04.319> they<00:04:05.040> will<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.370> spawning

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
backside because they will be spawning

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.119 
backside because they will be spawning
just<00:04:07.109> all<00:04:07.290> over<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.590> place<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:07.980> kind<00:04:08.099> of

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
just all over the place it's kind of

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.879 
just all over the place it's kind of
hard<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.340> tell<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:10.229> don't<00:04:10.409> know<00:04:10.500> where<00:04:10.680> the

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
hard to tell and I don't know where the

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.069 
hard to tell and I don't know where the
yeah<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.699> think<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.479> we<00:04:12.629> have<00:04:12.750> some<00:04:12.930> more

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
yeah so I think that we have some more

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.949 
yeah so I think that we have some more
enemies<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.099> game<00:04:14.250> now<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.629> game<00:04:15.780> is

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
enemies in the game now that the game is

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:16.410 
enemies in the game now that the game is
gone

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
gone

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.060 
gone
on<00:04:16.510> but<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:17.260> know<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.380> took<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.740> little<00:04:17.830> bit<00:04:18.010> i

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
on but you know I took a little bit i

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.620 
on but you know I took a little bit i
went<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.490> a<00:04:18.520> little<00:04:18.670> bit<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> killstreak<00:04:19.240> in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
went on a little bit of a killstreak in

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.870 
went on a little bit of a killstreak in
in<00:04:20.260> all<00:04:20.380> honesty<00:04:20.830> I<00:04:20.860> think<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.490> if<00:04:21.580> I<00:04:21.700> play

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
in all honesty I think that if I play

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.030 
in all honesty I think that if I play
this<00:04:21.910> map<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.300> little<00:04:22.660> bit<00:04:22.750> more<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.590> will

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
this map a little bit more I will

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.680 
this map a little bit more I will
probably<00:04:24.430> be<00:04:24.490> able<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.670> Moab<00:04:25.000> in<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.240> map<00:04:25.420> I

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
probably be able to Moab in this map I

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.690 
probably be able to Moab in this map I
end<00:04:26.320> up<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.620> think<00:04:26.770> I've<00:04:26.860> gotten<00:04:27.100> like<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.250> 16<00:04:27.670> or

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
end up I think I've gotten like a 16 or

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.310 
end up I think I've gotten like a 16 or
17<00:04:28.120> kill<00:04:28.270> streak<00:04:28.480> on<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.690> one<00:04:28.810> already<00:04:29.050> a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
17 kill streak on this one already a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.040 
17 kill streak on this one already a
couple<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.040> times<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.490> i<00:04:30.640> think<00:04:30.910> i'm<00:04:31.450> crossing

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
couple of times so i think i'm crossing

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.720 
couple of times so i think i'm crossing
your<00:04:32.140> ass<00:04:32.740> in<00:04:32.890> my<00:04:33.010> fingers<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.370> i<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.610> make

but<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> other<00:04:39.190> map<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.550> going<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:39.760> be<00:04:39.820> real

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
but the other map is going to be real

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.300 
but the other map is going to be real
real<00:04:40.720> pain<00:04:40.960> in<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.080> backside<00:04:41.290> cuz<00:04:41.710> i<00:04:41.890> just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310

real pain in the backside cuz i just
don't<00:04:42.490> even<00:04:42.670> like<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.970> map<00:04:43.150> as<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:44.140> yet

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
don't even like the map as of yet

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.780 
don't even like the map as of yet
hopefully<00:04:44.710> i'll<00:04:44.830> be<00:04:44.860> able<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.190> get<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.310> gameplay

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
hopefully i'll be able to get a gameplay

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.670 
hopefully i'll be able to get a gameplay
on<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.000> but<00:04:46.180> so<00:04:46.420> far<00:04:46.660> it's<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:46.930> pretty

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
on it but so far it's just pretty

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.830 
on it but so far it's just pretty
horrendous<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:48.820> don't<00:04:49.510> know<00:04:49.600> it's<00:04:49.780> just

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
horrendous I don't know it's just

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.500 
horrendous I don't know it's just
confusing<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.500> me<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:50.770> like<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:52.120> don't

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
confusing to me it's like I I don't

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.850 
confusing to me it's like I I don't
really<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.080> look<00:04:53.230> of<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.410> map<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.740> this

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
really like the look of the map and this

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.160 
really like the look of the map and this
map<00:04:54.040> looks<00:04:54.400> pretty<00:04:54.820> plain<00:04:55.090> as<00:04:55.270> well<00:04:55.450> I<00:04:55.750> mean

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
map looks pretty plain as well I mean

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.440 
map looks pretty plain as well I mean
color<00:04:56.680> wise<00:04:56.890> its<00:04:57.190> kind<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.490> washed<00:04:57.910> out<00:04:58.180> but

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
color wise its kind of washed out but

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.600 
color wise its kind of washed out but
but<00:04:59.140> the<00:04:59.260> other<00:04:59.380> map<00:04:59.590> is<00:04:59.770> way<00:05:00.190> worse<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.550> my

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
but the other map is way worse in my

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.580 
but the other map is way worse in my
opinion<00:05:01.000> it's<00:05:01.240> just<00:05:01.390> not<00:05:01.570> it's<00:05:01.990> not<00:05:02.170> very<00:05:02.350> fun

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
opinion it's just not it's not very fun

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.650 
opinion it's just not it's not very fun
to<00:05:02.680> look<00:05:02.800> at<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.610> was<00:05:03.730> not<00:05:04.300> watching

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
to look at and there I was not watching

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.050 
to look at and there I was not watching
my<00:05:04.720> back<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.200> got<00:05:05.230> hit<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.430> unfortunately

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
my back and I got hit and unfortunately

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.490 
my back and I got hit and unfortunately
lost<00:05:07.270> my<00:05:07.450> kill<00:05:07.660> streak<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.080> was<00:05:08.200> on<00:05:08.290> there

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
lost my kill streak that I was on there

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.250 
lost my kill streak that I was on there
but<00:05:08.710> um<00:05:09.420> all<00:05:10.420> in<00:05:10.600> all<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.750> have<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.110> say<00:05:11.140> that

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
but um all in all I have to say that

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.140 
but um all in all I have to say that
this<00:05:11.470> map<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.890> give<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.460> always<00:05:12.940> give

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
this map I give this I always give

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.520 
this map I give this I always give
everything<00:05:13.360> like<00:05:13.540> an<00:05:13.630> 8<00:05:13.840> out<00:05:13.990> of<00:05:14.020> 10<00:05:14.260> but<00:05:14.470> i

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
everything like an 8 out of 10 but i

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.140 
everything like an 8 out of 10 but i
would<00:05:14.680> give<00:05:14.830> this<00:05:14.860> one<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.460> an<00:05:15.580> 8<00:05:15.760> out<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:15.970> 10

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
would give this one like an 8 out of 10

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.140 
would give this one like an 8 out of 10
like<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.870> there's<00:05:17.200> not<00:05:17.380> maybe<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.370> seven<00:05:18.970> or

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
like that there's not maybe a seven or

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.730 
like that there's not maybe a seven or
eight<00:05:19.270> at<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.450> ten<00:05:19.660> i'm<00:05:19.780> not<00:05:19.930> sure<00:05:20.110> it<00:05:20.440> probably

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
eight at a ten i'm not sure it probably

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.470 
eight at a ten i'm not sure it probably
fun<00:05:21.130> on<00:05:21.250> ground<00:05:21.490> more<00:05:21.670> it's<00:05:22.210> there's

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
fun on ground more it's there's

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.720 
fun on ground more it's there's
definitely<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.930> lot<00:05:23.080> of<00:05:23.230> sniping<00:05:23.770> locations

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
definitely a lot of sniping locations

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.480 
definitely a lot of sniping locations
obviously<00:05:25.270> up<00:05:25.450> like<00:05:26.140> on<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.100> top<00:05:27.250> of<00:05:27.430> the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
obviously up like on the the top of the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.130 
obviously up like on the the top of the
buildings<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:27.970> stuff<00:05:28.120> there's<00:05:28.690> lots<00:05:28.870> and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
buildings and stuff there's lots and

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.130 
buildings and stuff there's lots and
lots<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.440> area<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:30.070> cover<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.670> this<00:05:30.760> map

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
lots of area to cover in this map

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.020 
lots of area to cover in this map
vertically<00:05:32.140> as<00:05:32.290> well<00:05:32.740> as<00:05:32.890> well<00:05:33.100> as<00:05:33.250> just<00:05:33.730> I

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
vertically as well as well as just I

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.570 
vertically as well as well as just I
mean<00:05:34.150> on<00:05:34.450> foot<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.380> uh<00:05:35.440> but<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.370> thing<00:05:36.550> about

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
mean on foot but uh but the thing about

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.810 
mean on foot but uh but the thing about
this<00:05:37.060> this<00:05:37.390> map<00:05:37.630> that's<00:05:37.870> kind<00:05:38.170> of<00:05:38.490> unique<00:05:39.490> I

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
this this map that's kind of unique I

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.450 
this this map that's kind of unique I
guess<00:05:40.060> is<00:05:40.300> Vegas<00:05:41.170> sniping<00:05:41.890> area<00:05:42.160> of<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.340> map

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
guess is Vegas sniping area of the map

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.430 
guess is Vegas sniping area of the map
is<00:05:42.730> in<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.090> middle<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.540> map<00:05:43.720> which<00:05:44.020> is

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
is in the middle of the map which is

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.660 
is in the middle of the map which is
like<00:05:44.680> three<00:05:44.920> I<00:05:44.950> think<00:05:45.250> it's<00:05:45.340> three<00:05:45.490> stories

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
like three I think it's three stories

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.910 
like three I think it's three stories
high<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.540> can<00:05:46.690> actually<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:47.230> juice<00:05:47.620> was<00:05:47.800> in

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
high and you can actually a juice was in

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.590 
high and you can actually a juice was in
that<00:05:48.010> area<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.370> whole<00:05:48.490> time<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:48.970> he<00:05:49.180> was<00:05:49.540> uh

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
that area the whole time and he was uh

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.360 
that area the whole time and he was uh
for<00:05:50.410> most<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.740> time<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:50.980> he<00:05:51.070> was<00:05:51.160> able<00:05:51.280> to

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
for most of the time and he was able to

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.160 
for most of the time and he was able to
get<00:05:51.490> quite<00:05:51.700> a<00:05:51.730> few<00:05:51.790> kills<00:05:52.150> from<00:05:52.330> that<00:05:52.510> area<00:05:52.660> so

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
get quite a few kills from that area so

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.900 
get quite a few kills from that area so
if<00:05:53.470> you<00:05:53.890> move<00:05:54.100> around<00:05:54.220> within<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.700> middle

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
if you move around within the middle

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.310 
if you move around within the middle
area<00:05:55.090> like<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.630> could<00:05:55.780> probably<00:05:55.960> play<00:05:56.170> it

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
area like you could probably play it

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.230 
area like you could probably play it
pretty<00:05:56.500> safe<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:56.980> get<00:05:57.730> some<00:05:57.880> kills<00:05:58.060> I

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
pretty safe and get some kills I

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.430 
pretty safe and get some kills I
wouldn't<00:05:58.540> recommend<00:05:58.780> snip<00:05:59.140> there<00:05:59.260> the<00:05:59.350> whole

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
wouldn't recommend snip there the whole

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.500 
wouldn't recommend snip there the whole
time<00:05:59.500> but<00:06:00.250> uh<00:06:00.310> but<00:06:00.640> it<00:06:00.760> is<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:00.880> good<00:06:01.090> location

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
time but uh but it is a good location

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.690 
time but uh but it is a good location
especially<00:06:01.840> to<00:06:02.320> maybe<00:06:03.070> get<00:06:03.280> some<00:06:03.430> time<00:06:03.520> look<00:06:03.610> I

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
especially to maybe get some time look I

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.610 
especially to maybe get some time look I
think<00:06:03.880> that<00:06:03.970> got<00:06:04.090> killed<00:06:04.270> himself<00:06:04.420> but<00:06:05.350> it<00:06:05.530> is

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
think that got killed himself but it is

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.290 
think that got killed himself but it is
a<00:06:05.650> good<00:06:05.800> location<00:06:06.070> to<00:06:06.310> get<00:06:06.430> some<00:06:06.640> some<00:06:07.060> kills

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
a good location to get some some kills

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.590 
a good location to get some some kills
and<00:06:07.480> build<00:06:08.080> that<00:06:08.140> kill<00:06:08.440> streak<00:06:08.680> up<00:06:09.270> all<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.480> all

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
and build that kill streak up all in all

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.050 
and build that kill streak up all in all
