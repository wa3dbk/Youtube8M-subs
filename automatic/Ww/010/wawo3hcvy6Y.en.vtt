hey<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:01.879> another<00:00:02.879> video<00:00:03.120> for<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.899> wheels<00:00:04.500> in

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
hey guys another video for the wheels in

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.419 
hey guys another video for the wheels in
Japan<00:00:05.759> playlists<00:00:07.040> get<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> occasional

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Japan playlists get the occasional

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.730 
Japan playlists get the occasional
comment<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.360> other<00:00:09.599> videos<00:00:10.050> some<00:00:10.410> people

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
comment on other videos some people

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.999 
comment on other videos some people
notice<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:12.330> cars<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:13.469> they<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.710> in

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
notice that the cars that they see in

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.910 
notice that the cars that they see in
the<00:00:14.099> car<00:00:14.340> parks<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.880> Japan<00:00:15.210> often<00:00:15.830> parked<00:00:16.830> in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
the car parks in Japan often parked in

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.120 
the car parks in Japan often parked in
the<00:00:17.010> same<00:00:17.250> way<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:19.560> drivers<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the same way in that the drivers of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.210 
the same way in that the drivers of
reversed<00:00:20.490> Park<00:00:20.910> them<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.410> Park<00:00:22.800> facing

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
reversed Park them so if Park facing

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.890 
reversed Park them so if Park facing
outward<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.029> car<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.510> when<00:00:24.779> they

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
outward so like this car here when they

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.250 
outward so like this car here when they
park<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:25.710> reverse<00:00:26.130> park<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:28.170> they

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
park they reverse park and when they

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.929 
park they reverse park and when they
come<00:00:28.439> back<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> currently<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.699> drive

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
come back to the currently if they drive

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.209 
come back to the currently if they drive
straight<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.830> some<00:00:31.830> people<00:00:32.099> have

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
straight out and some people have

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.069 
straight out and some people have
noticed<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.210> some<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> other<00:00:33.719> videos

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
noticed this in some of the other videos

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.440 
noticed this in some of the other videos
so<00:00:34.290> Elliott<00:00:34.739> videos<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.250> had<00:00:35.550> car<00:00:35.880> parks<00:00:36.300> in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
so Elliott videos of had car parks in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.639 
so Elliott videos of had car parks in
them<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.809> said<00:00:37.440> why<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:39.320> there<00:00:40.320> seems<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
them and said why is this there seems to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.590 
them and said why is this there seems to
be<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.860> variety<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.520> reasons<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> think

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
be a variety of reasons for it I think

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
be a variety of reasons for it I think
there's<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:42.960> percentage<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> people<00:00:43.680> who

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
there's a good percentage of people who

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.170 
there's a good percentage of people who
probably<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> automatically

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
probably just do it automatically

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
probably just do it automatically
because<00:00:45.450> everybody<00:00:45.899> does<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:49.550> think

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because everybody does it I think

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.860 
because everybody does it I think
there's<00:00:50.730> probably<00:00:50.850> some<00:00:51.210> other<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.750> who

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
there's probably some other people who

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.990 
there's probably some other people who
do<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.350> they've<00:00:52.649> always<00:00:52.800> done<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
do it because they've always done it but

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.990 
do it because they've always done it but
there<00:00:54.570> does<00:00:54.840> seem<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> feeling

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
there does seem to be a bit of a feeling

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.299 
there does seem to be a bit of a feeling
here<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.809> safer<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:59.629> if<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
here that it's safer that if you do it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.149 
here that it's safer that if you do it
this<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.210> drive<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:04.159> like

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this way when you actually drive up like

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
this way when you actually drive up like
this<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.360> what's<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.930> around

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
this we can see what's going on around

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
this we can see what's going on around
us<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:07.770> other<00:01:07.920> cars<00:01:08.189> moving<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
us we can see other cars moving we can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
us we can see other cars moving we can
see<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.180> anybody's<00:01:09.659> walking<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.310> see

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
see if anybody's walking so we can see

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.399 
see if anybody's walking so we can see
clearly<00:01:11.939> what's<00:01:12.659> happening<00:01:13.049> around<00:01:13.170> us

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
clearly what's happening around us

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
clearly what's happening around us
before<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.159> their<00:01:14.369> reversing<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
before we do their reversing into the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.460 
before we do their reversing into the
space<00:01:16.189> whereas<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.659> we<00:01:18.659> drive<00:01:18.869> straight<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
space whereas if we drive straight in

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
space whereas if we drive straight in
now<00:01:19.680> when<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.070> come<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> leave<00:01:20.580> later<00:01:20.909> it's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
now when we come to leave later it's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.060 
now when we come to leave later it's
harder<00:01:21.869> harder<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.439> us<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.890> what's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
harder harder for us to see what's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.420 
harder harder for us to see what's
happening<00:01:23.369> behind<00:01:23.549> us<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.840> reverse<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.530> if

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
happening behind us as we reverse out if

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.859 
happening behind us as we reverse out if
there's<00:01:26.670> people<00:01:26.850> walking<00:01:27.090> past<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.720> other

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
there's people walking past or other

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.010 
there's people walking past or other
cars<00:01:28.140> moving<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> guess<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.299> probably<00:01:30.810> does

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
cars moving so I guess it probably does

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.429 
cars moving so I guess it probably does
seem<00:01:31.680> safer<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.439> another

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
seem safer to do it that way another

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.819 
seem safer to do it that way another
person<00:01:34.560> actually<00:01:35.310> commented<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> me<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.829> if

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
person actually commented to me that if

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
person actually commented to me that if
cars<00:01:38.189> are<00:01:38.430> parked<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.030> someone<00:01:39.390> parks<00:01:39.720> close

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
cars are parked is someone parks close

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.310 
cars are parked is someone parks close
to<00:01:40.380> her<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.189> while<00:01:41.400> she's<00:01:41.670> gone<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.930> somebody

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to her so while she's gone if somebody

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
to her so while she's gone if somebody
parks<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:43.920> close<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> her<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:45.329> she

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
parks really close to her when she

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
parks really close to her when she
returns<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> her<00:01:46.560> car<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:47.070> easier<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.549> her

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
returns to her car it's easier for her

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.490 
returns to her car it's easier for her
to<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.840> she<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.229> drive

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
to get out if she can just drive

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
to get out if she can just drive
straight<00:01:49.799> out<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.640> somebody<00:01:51.000> else<00:01:51.180> has<00:01:51.360> parked

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
straight out if somebody else has parked

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.520 
straight out if somebody else has parked
really<00:01:51.869> close<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> her<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.960> seems<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> be

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
really close to her so it seems to be

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249 
really close to her so it seems to be
the<00:01:55.649> case<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.840> probably<00:01:57.960> also

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the case so I think it's probably also

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.859 
the case so I think it's probably also
an<00:01:58.439> element<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.369> some<00:02:00.090> difference<00:02:00.600> between

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
Japan and other countries is Japan is a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.289 
Japan and other countries is Japan is a
lot<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.130> places<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.430> Japan<00:02:05.759> where<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.060> park

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
lot of places in Japan where we park

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.900 
lot of places in Japan where we park
that<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:06.840> tight<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.550> lot<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.670> small

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that are pretty tight a lot of small

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.050 
that are pretty tight a lot of small
streets<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.539> lot<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.780> small<00:02:10.050> parking<00:02:10.500> areas

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
streets a lot of small parking areas

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080 
streets a lot of small parking areas
with<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.810> narrow<00:02:13.080> spaces<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
with with narrow spaces and and not a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.360 
with with narrow spaces and and not a
lot<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.330> space<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> move<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.380> guess<00:02:16.740> that's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
lot of space to move so I guess that's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.309 
lot of space to move so I guess that's
probably<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.880> reason<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.780> well<00:02:18.959> while

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
probably a reason for it as well while

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.070

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.270 
people tend to do it this way but as you
can<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.740> in<00:02:22.830> front<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.069> their<00:02:23.160> own
