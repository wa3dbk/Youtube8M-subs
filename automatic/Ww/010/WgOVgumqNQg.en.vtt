now<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.800> honest<00:02:39.040> Ubisoft<00:02:39.700> pretty<00:02:40.510> much

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
now to be honest Ubisoft pretty much

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.680 
now to be honest Ubisoft pretty much
consistently<00:02:41.500> come<00:02:41.709> under<00:02:42.010> fire<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.519> their

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
optimization problems they do seem to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.809 
optimization problems they do seem to
have<00:02:46.870> problems<00:02:47.500> getting<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:48.160> games<00:02:48.489> well

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
have problems getting a games well

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.539 
have problems getting a games well
optimized<00:02:49.299> for<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.750> PC<00:02:50.200> watch<00:02:50.440> dogs<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:51.099> not

optimized for the PC watch dogs is not

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.350 
optimized for the PC watch dogs is not
particularly<00:02:51.880> well<00:02:52.030> optimized<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:54.040> ultra<00:02:55.000> so

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
particularly well optimized on ultra so

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.180 
particularly well optimized on ultra so
honest<00:02:55.599> even<00:02:55.870> if<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.170> have<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.410> high-end<00:02:56.860> rig

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
honest even if you have a high-end rig

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.300 
honest even if you have a high-end rig
it's<00:02:57.549> not<00:02:58.180> particularly<00:02:58.690> well<00:02:58.870> optimized<00:02:59.380> so

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
it's not particularly well optimized so

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.620 
it's not particularly well optimized so
I<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.880> kind<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.360> where<00:03:01.480> they're<00:03:01.599> coming

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
I can kind of see where they're coming

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.350 
I can kind of see where they're coming
from<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.440> terms<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.980> how<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:03.549> can<00:03:04.090> give<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
from in terms of how we can give the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.759 
from in terms of how we can give the
game<00:03:04.510> look<00:03:04.690> even<00:03:04.900> better<00:03:05.170> might<00:03:05.500> make<00:03:05.650> it

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
game look even better might make it

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.140 
game look even better might make it
unstable<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:06.489> that's<00:03:06.640> not<00:03:06.790> really<00:03:07.000> saying

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
unstable but that's not really saying

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.610 
unstable but that's not really saying
anything<00:03:07.299> about<00:03:07.690> these<00:03:07.840> visuals<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.440> more

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
anything about these visuals is more

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.900 
anything about these visuals is more
saying<00:03:08.829> about<00:03:09.069> well<00:03:09.310> maybe<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.760> should<00:03:09.880> have

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
saying about well maybe you should have

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.050 
saying about well maybe you should have
optimized<00:03:10.360> your<00:03:10.569> game<00:03:10.810> better<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.760> honest<00:03:12.910> I

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
optimized your game better so honest I

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.490 
optimized your game better so honest I
think<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.329> should<00:03:13.480> at<00:03:13.540> least<00:03:13.720> give<00:03:14.200> players

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
think you should at least give players

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.979 
think you should at least give players
the<00:03:14.650> option<00:03:15.069> of<00:03:15.790> having<00:03:16.150> these<00:03:16.510> settings

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the option of having these settings

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.860 
the option of having these settings
making<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.130> ultra<00:03:19.000> plus<00:03:19.329> settings

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
making it like the ultra plus settings

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.259 
making it like the ultra plus settings
just<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:20.380> example<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.760> give<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:21.940> warning

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
just for example and just give a warning

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.750 
just for example and just give a warning
these<00:03:23.079> settings<00:03:23.590> may<00:03:23.950> cause<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.519> Palace

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
these settings may cause to Palace

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.990 
these settings may cause to Palace
instability<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:25.810> your<00:03:26.019> machine<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:27.489> at

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
instability in your machine then at

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.470 
instability in your machine then at
least<00:03:28.540> people<00:03:28.900> couldn't<00:03:29.350> see<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:30.040> they

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
least people couldn't see that they

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.840 
least people couldn't see that they
tried<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:32.019> make<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.260> look<00:03:32.500> as<00:03:32.709> close<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.639> the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
tried to make it look as close to the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.420 
tried to make it look as close to the
demo<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.420> they<00:03:34.810> showed<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.200> III<00:03:35.530> 2012<00:03:36.250> as

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
demo that they showed it III 2012 as

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.000 
demo that they showed it III 2012 as
possible<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.180> then<00:03:37.750> if<00:03:37.959> they<00:03:38.109> get<00:03:38.319> framerate

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
possible and then if they get framerate

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.940 
possible and then if they get framerate
problems<00:03:39.730> or<00:03:40.120> performance<00:03:41.049> issues<00:03:41.500> or

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
problems or performance issues or

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.009 
problems or performance issues or
whatever<00:03:42.549> then<00:03:43.239> they<00:03:43.359> play<00:03:43.540> can<00:03:43.690> go<00:03:43.840> yeah

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
whatever then they play can go yeah

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.660 
whatever then they play can go yeah
that's<00:03:44.500> nice<00:03:44.680> but<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.190> dial<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.519> back<00:03:45.549> a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
that's nice but on the dial it back a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.819 
that's nice but on the dial it back a
little<00:03:45.940> bit<00:03:46.180> because<00:03:46.359> well<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.019> prefer

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
little bit because well I prefer

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.879 
little bit because well I prefer
gameplay<00:03:48.400> over<00:03:48.609> graphics<00:03:49.150> or<00:03:49.530> my<00:03:50.530> machine<00:03:50.859> is

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
gameplay over graphics or my machine is

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.559 
gameplay over graphics or my machine is
quite<00:03:51.340> powerful<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:51.940> handle<00:03:52.269> it<00:03:52.420> or

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
quite powerful have to handle it or

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.110 
quite powerful have to handle it or
whatever

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
whatever

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.850 
whatever
and<00:03:54.720> they<00:03:54.810> said<00:03:55.019> they're<00:03:55.170> given<00:03:55.470> giving

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
and they said they're given giving

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.920 
and they said they're given giving
players<00:03:56.159> a<00:03:56.280> choice<00:03:56.819> now<00:03:57.360> what<00:03:57.510> they've<00:03:57.659> really
