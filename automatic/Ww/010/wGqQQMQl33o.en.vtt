back to the left so you kind of make

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.410 
back to the left so you kind of make
this<00:01:25.350> shape<00:01:25.970> here<00:01:27.500> on<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:30.119> edge<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> your

fabric and now from here we want to
measure<00:01:38.000> about<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> quarter<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:40.079> inch<00:01:40.880> so

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
about a quarter of an inch and we're

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.859 
about a quarter of an inch and we're
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> give<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:53.180> slight<00:01:54.180> press<00:01:54.509> we

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
going to give this a slight press we

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
going to give this a slight press we
don't<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.990> press<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.759> too<00:01:59.759> hard

don't want to press this too hard

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.639 
don't want to press this too hard
because<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> make<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> crease

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because we don't want to make a crease

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.399 
because we don't want to make a crease
in<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> fabric<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
in the fabric but as you can see this is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.530 
in the fabric but as you can see this is
bubbling<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.250> lot<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.000> when<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.240> put<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
bubbling a lot and so when we put that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.090 
bubbling a lot and so when we put that
through<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> sewing<00:02:06.960> machine<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.040> to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
through the sewing machine it's going to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.310 
through the sewing machine it's going to
be<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> little<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.850> little<00:02:09.540> obnoxious<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
be a little a little obnoxious so if you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.770 
be a little a little obnoxious so if you
hover<00:02:10.829> your<00:02:11.160> iron<00:02:11.430> across<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.209> top<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
hover your iron across the top so just

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.370 
hover your iron across the top so just
some<00:02:13.110> steam<00:02:13.500> gets<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> fabric

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
some steam gets on the fabric

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.950 
some steam gets on the fabric
it's<00:02:16.130> going<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.640> flatten<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.690> out<00:02:17.750> a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
it's going to just flatten that out a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.800 
it's going to just flatten that out a
little<00:02:18.230> bit<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.640> what<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.120> do<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
little bit and then what you can do is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:30.100 
little bit and then what you can do is

several<00:02:51.500> straight<00:02:51.830> stitches<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.550> then<00:02:52.820> it

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
several straight stitches and then it

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.870 
several straight stitches and then it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
hem foot we have a little gauge on the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.570 
hem foot we have a little gauge on the
side<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.720> kind<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.470> helps<00:03:03.920> align<00:03:04.310> your

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
fabric so that the bite that the zigzag

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.550 
fabric so that the bite that the zigzag
takes<00:03:07.820> only<00:03:08.090> catches<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.840> very<00:03:09.050> edge<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.440> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
and both threads to the back and now the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.490 
and both threads to the back and now the
blind<00:03:25.130> hem<00:03:25.460> foot<00:03:26.020> because<00:03:27.020> every<00:03:27.260> sewing

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
blind hem foot because every sewing

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.650 
blind hem foot because every sewing
machine<00:03:27.740> is<00:03:27.860> different<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.460> has<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:28.670> gauge<00:03:29.300> so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
machine is different it has a gauge so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.380 
machine is different it has a gauge so
you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.930> kind<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.410> move<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.850> left<00:03:32.090> or

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
you can kind of move it to the left or

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.540 
you can kind of move it to the left or
right<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.530> should<00:03:33.800> do<00:03:33.890> some<00:03:34.100> tests<00:03:34.460> at

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
right and so you should do some tests at

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.520 
right and so you should do some tests at
home<00:03:34.730> first<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.300> make<00:03:35.510> sure<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.290> you've<00:03:36.500> got
