they're<00:00:43.829> almost<00:00:43.980> different<00:00:44.640> worlds<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
they're almost different worlds with a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
they're almost different worlds with a
tank<00:00:46.320> you've<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.739> hours<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.789> spend<00:00:48.090> under<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
tank you've got hours to spend under the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
tank you've got hours to spend under the
water<00:00:48.719> which<00:00:49.350> gives<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> certainly<00:00:50.250> an

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
water which gives you it certainly an

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
water which gives you it certainly an
obvious<00:00:50.850> advantage<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:52.020> you're

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
obvious advantage there but you're

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.330 
obvious advantage there but you're
making<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> noise<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> you're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
making a lot of noise and you're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
making a lot of noise and you're
carrying<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> lot<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.030> garbage<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.809> back

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
carrying a lot of garbage on your back

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
carrying a lot of garbage on your back
when<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:55.800> free<00:00:55.980> diving<00:00:56.250> you're<00:00:56.730> you're

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
when you're free diving you're you're

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
when you're free diving you're you're
free<00:00:57.809> that's<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.649> you're<00:00:59.359> streamlined

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
free that's it you're you're streamlined

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.500 
free that's it you're you're streamlined
and<00:01:01.010> actually<00:01:02.010> I've<00:01:02.129> found<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> daze<00:01:02.940> diving

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and actually I've found in a daze diving

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
and actually I've found in a daze diving
I<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.750> spend<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.080> time<00:01:04.260> under<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> water

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
I can spend more time under the water

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
I can spend more time under the water
than<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> average<00:01:05.790> tank<00:01:06.090> diver<00:01:06.360> does<00:01:06.689> because

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
than the average tank diver does because

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
than the average tank diver does because
15<00:01:07.530> second<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> surface<00:01:08.689> 60<00:01:09.689> seconds<00:01:10.110> back

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
15 second at the surface 60 seconds back

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.070 
15 second at the surface 60 seconds back
down<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.430> day<00:01:11.460> long<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
down i can do that all day long and the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
down i can do that all day long and the
big<00:01:13.229> advantage<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.070> you're<00:01:14.340> silent<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
big advantage is that you're silent and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
big advantage is that you're silent and
you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.930> sneak<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:17.220> fish<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you can sneak up on these fish at the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.960 
you can sneak up on these fish at the
scuba<00:01:18.509> diver<00:01:18.750> can't<00:01:19.400> when<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> approach<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
scuba diver can't when you approach a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.660 
scuba diver can't when you approach a
fish<00:01:21.210> you've<00:01:21.630> got<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> minimize<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:23.070> profile

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
fish you've got to minimize your profile

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
fish you've got to minimize your profile
toward<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.240> fish<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> minimize<00:01:25.200> your

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
toward that fish and minimize your

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.170 
toward that fish and minimize your
motion<00:01:25.830> especially<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> front<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
motion especially on the front of you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.620 
motion especially on the front of you
which<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.390> closest<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> fish<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.600> when<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
which is closest to the fish so when I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.260 
which is closest to the fish so when I
see<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> prey<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> stalk<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.729> come<00:01:33.240> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
see a prey I'm going to stalk I come in

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.020 
see a prey I'm going to stalk I come in
out<00:01:33.600> an<00:01:33.720> angle<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.740> try<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> line<00:01:35.340> myself<00:01:35.549> up

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
out an angle and try to line myself up

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
out an angle and try to line myself up
so<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> present<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> smallest<00:01:37.650> profile

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so that I present the smallest profile

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
so that I present the smallest profile
and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.759> kick<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.840> tiny

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and then just kick with a little tiny

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.460 
and then just kick with a little tiny
kick<00:01:40.500> strokes<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.250> barely<00:01:41.729> moving<00:01:42.470> this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
kick strokes just barely moving this

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:55.280 
kick strokes just barely moving this
slide<00:01:43.740> into<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> shot

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
started to slow down I reached in and I

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.420 
started to slow down I reached in and I
pulled<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.209> skills<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.560> little<00:04:02.890> faster

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
pulled it skills to be a little faster

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.570 
pulled it skills to be a little faster
to<00:04:04.000> make<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.209> little<00:04:04.480> bit<00:04:04.600> easier<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.930> deal<00:04:05.230> with

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
to make a little bit easier to deal with

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.460 
to make a little bit easier to deal with
before<00:04:06.580> i<00:04:06.820> took<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.300> fish<00:04:07.750> off<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:07.989> spear<00:04:08.440> i

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
before i took the fish off the spear i

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.979 
before i took the fish off the spear i
ran<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:09.090> stringer<00:04:10.090> through<00:04:10.330> its<00:04:10.420> now<00:04:10.630> and

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
ran the stringer through its now and

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.300 
ran the stringer through its now and
finally<00:04:11.860> got<00:04:12.040> control<00:04:12.489> of<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.980> was<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.190> hell

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
finally got control of it it was a hell

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.039 
finally got control of it it was a hell
of<00:04:15.340> an<00:04:15.519> experience<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.359> it's<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.690> really<00:04:16.870> nice

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
of an experience and it's a really nice

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.979 
of an experience and it's a really nice
fish<00:04:17.880> there<00:04:18.880> are<00:04:19.030> limits<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.690> know<00:04:19.780> in<00:04:19.959> the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
fish there are limits you know in the

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.409 
fish there are limits you know in the
society<00:04:20.560> do<00:04:20.769> live<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.640> what<00:04:21.850> type<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.120> fish<00:04:22.390> we

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
society do live on what type of fish we

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.570 
society do live on what type of fish we
can<00:04:22.690> catch<00:04:22.900> how<00:04:23.290> many<00:04:23.530> fish

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
can catch how many fish

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.490 
can catch how many fish
so<00:04:25.240> these<00:04:25.419> are<00:04:25.479> really<00:04:25.750> important<00:04:26.139> things<00:04:26.349> to

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
so these are really important things to

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.379 
so these are really important things to
keep<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.650> perspective<00:04:26.919> when<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.610> are<00:04:27.789> hunting

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
keep in perspective when you are hunting

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.129 
keep in perspective when you are hunting
fishing<00:04:29.970> typically<00:04:30.970> when<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.240> do<00:04:31.360> go<00:04:31.659> down<00:04:31.689> and

fishing typically when I do go down and

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.589 
fishing typically when I do go down and
look<00:04:32.590> for<00:04:32.800> fish<00:04:33.039> I'll<00:04:33.759> get<00:04:34.000> only<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.419> fish

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
look for fish I'll get only the fish

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.330 
look for fish I'll get only the fish
that<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:34.870> can<00:04:35.020> eat<00:04:35.169> for<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.770> day<00:04:35.919> or<00:04:36.039> maybe

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
that I can eat for that day or maybe
