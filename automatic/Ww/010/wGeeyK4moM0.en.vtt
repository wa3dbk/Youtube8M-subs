comments what you guys are thinking I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.740 
comments what you guys are thinking I
honestly<00:02:18.980> think<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.970> deal<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.390> going<00:02:20.600> to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
honestly think that the deal is going to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.380 
honestly think that the deal is going to
be<00:02:20.870> broken<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.590> think<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.430> both<00:02:22.610> consoles<00:02:23.150> are

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
be broken I think that both consoles are

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.140 
be broken I think that both consoles are
going<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.989> exclusivity<00:02:24.650> first<00:02:25.150> simply

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
going to have exclusivity first simply

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
going to have exclusivity first simply
because<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.750> fact<00:02:26.989> being<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.069> Call<00:02:28.280> of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
because of the fact being the Call of

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.370 
because of the fact being the Call of
Duty<00:02:28.640> has<00:02:28.760> been<00:02:28.819> dying<00:02:29.360> over<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.170> past

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
Duty has been dying over the past

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380 
Duty has been dying over the past
several<00:02:30.709> years<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.640> would<00:02:31.760> only<00:02:31.940> be<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
several years and it would only be the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.090 
several years and it would only be the
smartest<00:02:32.810> thing<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.020> do<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.860> both

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
smartest thing to do to have both

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.009 
smartest thing to do to have both
exclusivity<00:02:34.790> on<00:02:34.940> PlayStation<00:02:35.570> 4<00:02:35.600> which<00:02:35.900> is

exclusivity on PlayStation 4 which is

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.330 
exclusivity on PlayStation 4 which is

thousands and of course on Xbox one

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.120 
thousands and of course on Xbox one
because<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:41.540> more<00:02:41.720> reservations<00:02:42.380> were<00:02:42.620> for

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
because a lot more reservations were for

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.740 
because a lot more reservations were for
Call<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.310> Duty<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:43.640> Xbox<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.150> than<00:02:44.540> they<00:02:44.690> were

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
Call of Duty on Xbox one than they were

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.590 
Call of Duty on Xbox one than they were
for<00:02:45.110> PlayStation<00:02:45.680> 4<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.130> only<00:02:46.640> because<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.209> lot

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
for PlayStation 4 and only because a lot

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.790 
for PlayStation 4 and only because a lot

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
of the color of Duty players you know

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.830 
of the color of Duty players you know
have<00:02:49.220> migrated<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:49.910> PlayStation<00:02:50.450> 2<00:02:50.570> Xbox

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
have migrated for PlayStation 2 Xbox

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.050 
have migrated for PlayStation 2 Xbox
before<00:02:51.739> because<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> fact<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.640> for<00:02:52.760> X

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
before because of the fact that for X

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.460 
before because of the fact that for X
amount<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.360> years<00:02:53.420> Xbox<00:02:54.110> would<00:02:54.290> get

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
amount of years Xbox would get

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.430 
amount of years Xbox would get
exclusively<00:02:55.459> first<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.510> either<00:02:56.780> or<00:02:57.019> both

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
exclusively first so either or both

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.040 
exclusively first so either or both
consoles<00:02:57.950> are<00:02:58.070> good<00:02:58.310> for<00:02:59.060> Call<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.300> Duty<00:02:59.660> to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
consoles are good for Call of Duty to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.900 
consoles are good for Call of Duty to
actually<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.470> know<00:03:00.500> migrate<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.280> as<00:03:01.459> far<00:03:01.850> as

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
actually you know migrate to as far as

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.580 
actually you know migrate to as far as
the<00:03:02.090> Aussie<00:03:02.330> go<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:02.750> what<00:03:03.019> they're<00:03:03.200> doing<00:03:03.230> is

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
the Aussie go so what they're doing is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.460 
the Aussie go so what they're doing is
they<00:03:04.220> saw<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.790> maybe<00:03:05.180> Xbox<00:03:05.870> one<00:03:06.049> has<00:03:06.170> getting

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
they saw that maybe Xbox one has getting

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.569 
they saw that maybe Xbox one has getting
you<00:03:06.620> know<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.829> getting<00:03:06.920> most<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
you know it's getting most of the

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.340 
you know it's getting most of the
reservations<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:08.600> only<00:03:08.780> because<00:03:09.110> probably

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
reservations but only because probably

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.500 
reservations but only because probably
plays<00:03:09.769> have<00:03:10.280> migrated<00:03:10.790> because<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.269> past

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
plays have migrated because of the past

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.140 
plays have migrated because of the past
you<00:03:12.019> know<00:03:12.140> Xbox<00:03:12.650> having<00:03:12.980> DLC<00:03:13.310> first<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:13.760> then

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
you know Xbox having DLC first and then

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.729 
you know Xbox having DLC first and then
of<00:03:14.269> course<00:03:14.299> also<00:03:14.930> having<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.230> first<00:03:15.440> at<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
of course also having the first at the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.770 
of course also having the first at the
same<00:03:15.920> time<00:03:16.160> as<00:03:16.310> Xbox<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.850> PlayStation<00:03:17.390> 4

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
same time as Xbox on PlayStation 4

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.960 
same time as Xbox on PlayStation 4
because<00:03:18.500> PlayStation<00:03:19.340> 4<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.820> leading

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
because PlayStation 4 is the leading

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.970 
because PlayStation 4 is the leading
console<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.570> sales<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:21.440> would<00:03:21.530> only<00:03:21.709> make

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
console in sales so that would only make

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.250 
console in sales so that would only make
sense<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.579> these<00:03:22.850> developers<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.200> know

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
sense for these developers you know

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.590 
sense for these developers you know
Activision<00:03:24.890> chart<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.850> know<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.329> bring
