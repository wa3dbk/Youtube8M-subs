00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.670
 the new this is now our calling 9 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.770
 fragile 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.700
 with this two ways of doing this not 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.630
 It's fragile 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.940
 the first is thus a half a turn 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:28.560
 yea 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.560
 pass twice behind 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:42.730
 this way here is the way that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.730
 You pass the middle afterwards, I 'll call you. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.200
 this reason 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.309
 and it was this way 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 For who wants to see this knot if ours is 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.860
 for you to limit the cable 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.980
 You put a noc and another here and what 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.230
 Do you want to hold it in the middle? 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:26.470
 limited and do not dwell on a 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:33.360
 can pass the other 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 the other way is simply so 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:47.070
 also around me 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:47.070
 only you get a 23 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.450
 then I want him 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.060
 well these two ways that I know
