00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.950
 that same minecraft video and good today 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.290
 I will teach you a bot and nothing so alone is 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:32.169
 how to make this soldier that you can 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:35.030
 defend in mycroft 112.2 1.313 1.2 4.5 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.750
 and 1.3 points 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.750
 good 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.990
 not here 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.570
 I have a world here 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.470
 the world of the past video of the smart 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.040
 moving 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.040
 you can see 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.820
 just for this way of occupying 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.930
 iron blocks 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.930
 and pumpkins 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.900
 even if they do not do it they do not create 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.490
 we are also going to occupy snow 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 Snow 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.490
 to pumpkin good these are the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 main monitos 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.720
 2 but it's a pumpkin and this is a 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.330
 snow monkey you can see 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 discussions 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.590
 Lets put 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.590
 easy 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.180
 I will put here again 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.180
 well that night I'm going to talk 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.870
 well I put it here at night 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.880
 and I'm going to grab zombies so they can 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.880
 give 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.050
 as you can see him start shooting no 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.929
 he lets them attack him but they are very weak 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.929
 that's why you have to protect them 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.010
 as you can see are submachine guns 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.040
 with stone slabs 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.040
 the men 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.890
 2. 3 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.040
 and so they can not go through, we're going 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.040
 to do 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.280
 we remove the one below 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.890
 we cover it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.680
 can still see at night that I put 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.530
 months 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.489
 good as you can see it gives you a snow 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.489
 every time they kill him 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.720
 so I'm going to put 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.120
 and a pumpkin since it is here our 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.670
 big monster is like a jewel 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.190
 submachine guns but it does not take long 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.540
 kill them but this is very good 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.730
 to show 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.099
 today I 'm going to show you two types of 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.099
 monsters that can be done here one 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.230
 you can see how good I do not know why you 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:28.620
 it hurt 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.620
 I already know why this has to be 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.140
 longer 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.180
 good 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.180
 good since I'm here about this 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.730
 and hey, he does this to me 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.530
 it's also up 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.530
 they are smart enough to be able 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 create 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.550
 peter s 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.080
 well let's go since we finished doing 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.780
 this 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.780
 we just put in 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.630
 how can you see this works with 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.390
 any monster just that games 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.100
 zombies have swords you can also 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.230
 do this you can remove it with 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.900
 any zombie I just ended up not 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.919
 you are in hell 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.919
 so they tell you 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.730
 options 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.620
 and you can see that they can no longer do it 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.060
 nothing will I lower the volume 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.060
 what is taking away a lot 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.659
 is already shooting them 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.810
 and today I'm going to teach you another I'm going to 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.020
 and what will help them is this we are going to 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.000
 put a 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.740
 two 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.740
 another face 12 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.680
 we only put three lines of 2 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.240
 and a pumpkin and these dead are created 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.240
 they are called goals 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.800
 good 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.249
 as you can see attacking the pigs 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.249
 zombies 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.280
 let's go to the last lara with the base 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.200
 help 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.289
 good does not occupy much help really 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.360
 they are very strong 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.710
 They can not help you do it in 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.510
 anywhere 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.139
 they are very useful 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.550
 they are too useful 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.550
 and how can you see and follow 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.070
 tubular attics and cow no no you 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.900
 goals in my video 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.870
 as you can see team put another goal in 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.840
 the front of a zombie 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.670
 the goals this one can not kill creepers 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.710
 because those who exploit them are the 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:34.230
 powerful that they 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.230
 all except for them 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.390
 and because the blows kill a zombie 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.700
 anyone accepts a clippers 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.630
 or put here around him and they will see 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.630
 who will win this 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.360
 around him and they will win the 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.129
 tickets 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.189
 can see here 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:58.929
 the goal only the goal as it is very 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.929
 heavy takes on 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.140
 in reloading to be able to kill them 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.940
 there I have a golem help as they can 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:13.220
 see is not going to attack the clipper 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.410
 but I do not know about people who practice 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.120
 stripper to see why what because 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.120
 kripper people 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.620
 but I did not explode 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:36.600
 because I hope you liked it 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:40.640
 this video subscribe yourself and like it 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.640

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.160
 how 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.480
 already died because it was raining right now the 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.020
 world dies with the rain was 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.200
 these are the machine guns how they are made 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.390
 and these are the many like 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.310
 as golems or as you want to say 

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.310
