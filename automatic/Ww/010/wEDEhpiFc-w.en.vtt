really<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.320> think<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.160> one<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.550> easier

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
really I think this is one of the easier

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.699 
really I think this is one of the easier
places<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.540> find<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.900> blue<00:04:01.050> points<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.620> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
places to find the blue points if you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.410 
places to find the blue points if you
play<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.100> event<00:04:02.400> constantly<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:03.209> that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
play this event constantly with that

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.110 
play this event constantly with that
area<00:04:04.170> with<00:04:04.800> that<00:04:04.950> little<00:04:05.220> special<00:04:05.670> effect<00:04:05.760> I

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
area with that little special effect I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.490 
area with that little special effect I
think<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.420> can<00:04:06.570> find<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> red<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.380> blue

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
think you can find the red the blue

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.070 
think you can find the red the blue
coins<00:04:07.770> easily<00:04:08.310> because<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.510> seen<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> red

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
coins easily because I have seen the red

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.960 
coins easily because I have seen the red
coins<00:04:10.320> before<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.860> why<00:04:11.490> don't<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.790> sing

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.309 
single one and you really only have two
chances<00:05:51.409> to<00:05:51.680> get<00:05:51.949> each<00:05:52.099> one<00:05:52.400> so<00:05:53.020> I'm<00:05:54.020> here's

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
chances to get each one so I'm here's

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.350 
chances to get each one so I'm here's
one<00:05:54.740> that<00:05:55.039> way<00:05:55.340> and<00:05:55.699> there's<00:05:55.819> one<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.180> other

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
one that way and there's one the other

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.760 
one that way and there's one the other
way<00:05:56.659> so<00:05:58.509> either<00:05:59.509> way<00:05:59.900> you're<00:06:00.349> really<00:06:00.530> not

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
way so either way you're really not

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.339

I'll actually be explaining um another
short<00:07:27.610> concept<00:07:28.240> I<00:07:28.570> think<00:07:28.900> I<00:07:29.410> just<00:07:29.710> gotta<00:07:29.920> find

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
short concept I think I just gotta find

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.310 
short concept I think I just gotta find
one<00:07:30.520> that<00:07:30.670> I<00:07:30.700> think<00:07:31.000> we<00:07:31.810> might<00:07:31.840> go<00:07:32.140> to<00:07:32.200> the

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
one that I think we might go to the

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.750 
one that I think we might go to the
library<00:07:32.410> I'm<00:07:33.010> thinking<00:07:33.310> of<00:07:33.400> going<00:07:33.520> to<00:07:33.670> the

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
library I'm thinking of going to the

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.180 
library I'm thinking of going to the
library<00:07:34.240> and<00:07:34.450> just<00:07:34.660> checking<00:07:35.380> out<00:07:35.620> some<00:07:35.650> cool

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190 
library and just checking out some cool

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.250 
library and just checking out some cool
facts<00:07:36.490> about<00:07:36.730> the<00:07:36.880> Winter<00:07:37.150> Olympics<00:07:37.540> it

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260 
facts about the Winter Olympics it

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.720 
facts about the Winter Olympics it
that's<00:07:38.560> that's<00:07:38.830> really<00:07:39.100> what<00:07:39.310> I'm<00:07:39.430> thinking

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:39.730 
that's that's really what I'm thinking

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.000 
that's that's really what I'm thinking
of<00:07:39.790> doing<00:07:39.850> but<00:07:40.660> the<00:07:41.140> next<00:07:41.410> two<00:07:41.530> episodes<00:07:41.920> would

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.010 
of doing but the next two episodes would

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.220 
of doing but the next two episodes would
be<00:07:42.130> the<00:07:42.220> final<00:07:42.730> episodes<00:07:43.240> of<00:07:43.510> biocide<00:07:44.050> could

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.230 
be the final episodes of biocide could

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.750 
be the final episodes of biocide could
be<00:07:44.320> Olympic<00:07:44.650> Games<00:07:44.800> and<00:07:44.950> -<00:07:45.190> onto<00:07:45.400> the<00:07:45.520> Olympic
