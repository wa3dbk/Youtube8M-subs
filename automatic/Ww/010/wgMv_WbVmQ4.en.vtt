 there that is lost by the network that does not 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.870
 Know how to do certain things 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.090
 better as they get lost today find this 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.100
 video for youtube so good today 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.790
 I'm going to teach you how to play with your 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.470
 command of playstation 4 I started this 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.860
 tutorial as I said is for the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.509
 playstation 4 controls I do not know if it's going to 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.390
 work for playstation 3 for xbox 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.600
 one for 360 for the wii I have no 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.630
 idea is simply a dedicated tutorial 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.550
 for playstation 4 so good before 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.530
 that nothing obviously have a command of 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.670
 track are four usb cable for 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.649
 explain are 4 or have a bluetooth 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.360
 not in the computer that I have it like this 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.309
 what a cable game for those who 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.530
 they want leather by bluetooth 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.200
 is asking around I've seen videos 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.320
 and if you give the share button and the button 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.990
 play station when opening the ps in which 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.689
 it's right in the middle of the big circuit 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.579
 and if you press these two buttons at the same time 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.560
 the command will be synchronized by the 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.540
 bluetooth of your computer but 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.820
 good in this case in this tutorial I'm going 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.039
 to explain it with the usb which is what 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.720
 I use myself so good before anything 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.420
 you have to enter this page which 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.189
 I will leave of course in the description is 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.560
 an uncle, quite intelligent 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.360
 pretty cool that has made a program 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.710
 for all of us users of 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.299
 playstation 4 that obviously we do not have 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.610
 well, good keyboard handling and 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.770
 mouse not because this tutorial go 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.179
 focused for those people who at 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.909
 just as it does not cost you enough 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.039
 well adapted to play games on pc 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.600
 with the keyboard and the mouse not so 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.209
 we can make a small transition 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.979
 playing a little bit before with the command of 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.170
 bits a 4 and then adapt 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.330
 little by little with the mouse and the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.610
 keyboard so now the first thing before 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.459
 that nothing is downloading the tool 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.810
 set a zip point that what you see here 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:08.929
 has 716 house and head and some downloads 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.940
 from 41,500 55 to today so good 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.110
 It has no virus problems has 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.600
 problems of any kind 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.010
 nothing has happened to me and I have a 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.900
 antivirus as you see here the supply well 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 how good the case is who wants to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.280
 trust well and that is not because I'm looking for 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.990
 tutorial so good downloads this 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 program you take it to for example to 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.190
 desktop download the desktop and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.110
 with knowing what we are going to close we enter 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.290
 we obviously unzip the folder 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.640
 to decompress the winrar failure or by 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.140
 be points and it seems to make us 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.720
 missing nothing but the confessor's 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.050
 windows but once you unzip it is 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.180
 then open and go to virtual putts driver 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.970
 here to say that you do not have to have 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.010
 still plugged in the command of the track and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.989
 there are four in the pc we wait a second 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.420
 because first before I do this 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.930
 step you enter you double click on 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.570
 I enter whatever you do open him the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.830
 driver gives you to install will take a 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.300
 little bit more I have it installed by 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.230
 that has taken nothing but it will take a 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.010
 tast more for you and will put 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 install yes driver installed 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.940
 and now if you plug as I'm going to do 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 now plug the command of 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.700
 APRA are four using the USB to the PC 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.349
 or it will skip the ping here being safe and 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.489
 expressive pick up a I do not know why I 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.819
 jump because I supposedly have 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.310
 installed but installed is the driver 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.379
 if I have not already installed it on the remote and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.390
 this one also of course and then it 's 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.500
 here the previous folder 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.750
 sps pp server enter click and as 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.060
 you see someone appears your command of the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.650
 track are four is everything perfect you 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.000
 we give to give this for example we are going to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.519
 clean a little bit and we will give to be 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.480
 we are already starting working so 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.849
 we are not going to do a small test 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.349
 will show the failed titan to see if it is 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.209
 true that they worked so in a 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.190
 second let's see if it does not take long 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.069
 I have a fairly good computer to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.349
 see if it does not take long to start 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.549
 work the beta because good the truth 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.959
 is that I do not know if the sale today 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.849
 it still works or not 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.500
 I'm shitting a tad but good 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.610
 kids this tutorial as said serves 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.860
 for those people who 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.120
 it costs you to handle the keyboard and the 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.360
 mouse because there are many people who are 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.860
 happening to pc as well as right now as 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.209
 You see, I do not know if you are watching my course or 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.430
 no but I'm moving the cursor of the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.989
 so for now mouse now 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.910
 right now I'm just using the 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.340
 mouse and the keyboard but now as soon as 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.620
 let's enter the game you will see that yes 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.330
 works perfectly and perfectly 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 all controls and everything so good 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.550
 Like said here we go play option kit 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.860
 I have now and only in mode 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.870
 window but once we open the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.110
 program that we have here open 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.150
 everything is working perfect because it 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.850
 we give the play button to whatever it is and 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.890
 As you can see, I'm changing with the keyboard 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.050
 right now now I take the command I give to 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.690
 any key and as you can see then it jumps 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.460
 in the sele the x data center because it is 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.789
 this what it is is an emulator of the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.590
 xbox 360 and the only thing that does is that you 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:07.539
 command of prison 4 recognize her as 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.580
 if it was a command of the xbox 360 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.080
 here you see how you have now I'm 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.810
 playing perfectly with him when not 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.479
 I am but I can look for game I can 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.789
 doing 50,000 things can kill friends and 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.080
 so many things not so it works 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.330
 perfectly this program of 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.330
 true that is cool to see now 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.410
 and is already so now that 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.120
 we would search match would connect us and what 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.100
 what we did so you can play 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.020
 Any game I think I've tried 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.060
 with battlefield 4 I've tried it with 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.250
 the titan failed and the truth is that 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.990
 works perfectly so I hope 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.840
 that of course this has served you 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.750
 tutorial if the game goes fast 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.490
 Exactly then maybe we do something not 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.190
 I do not want to make the video too long either 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.720
 so you know how entertaining the more 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.300
 short better of course is my motto in 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.850
 how much less hard things 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.830
 better not so good kids what said 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.900
 if you have any questions section of 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.740
 comments of this tutorial is focused 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.180
 users and users of a 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.220
 command of application 4 so like 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.800
 you see here we can choose perfectly 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.290
 let's make you eat not catch the 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.630
 triple this this in a second and as 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.710
 You see, I'm going to throw 10 seconds of 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.710
 heading for you to see what 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.760
 the start not passed so one like 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.290
 You see, I start jumping whatever 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.150
 I do not have a super computer 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.490
 hyperpower so obviously at 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.830
 you are seeing these cats better but 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.169
 well this what there are kids I hope

 starts shooting a little shot grenades 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.680
 You see that it works perfectly 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.490
 the buttons we go around and I 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.680
 I know 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.630
 we jump we kick 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.100
 invisible we do everything so good 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.220
