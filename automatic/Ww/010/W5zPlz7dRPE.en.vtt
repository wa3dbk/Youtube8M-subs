00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.630 

I<00:03:44.659> think<00:03:45.349> it's<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.590> lot<00:03:45.769> better<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.190> creating

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
I think it's a lot better for creating

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.729 
I think it's a lot better for creating
petals<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:50.209> just<00:03:50.420> quick<00:03:50.659> strokes<00:03:53.739> just

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
petals and it's just quick strokes just

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.899 
petals and it's just quick strokes just
like<00:03:54.890> so<00:03:55.040> I'll<00:03:55.129> see<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:56.409> all<00:03:57.409> right<00:03:57.849> now<00:03:58.849> we

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
like so I'll see that all right now we

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.890
