00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
dough texture all right so I dumped in

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.249 
dough texture all right so I dumped in
about<00:02:07.159> another<00:02:07.369> quarter<00:02:08.239> maybe<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.840> third<00:02:09.049> of<00:02:09.170> a

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259

about another quarter maybe a third of a
cup<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.640> there's<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.540> texture<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:11.959> I'm

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
cup and there's the texture that I'm

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.920 
cup and there's the texture that I'm
going<00:02:12.380> for<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:13.549> also<00:02:13.700> depends<00:02:14.239> on<00:02:14.420> how<00:02:14.750> big

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
going for it also depends on how big

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.410 
going for it also depends on how big
your<00:02:15.049> sweet<00:02:15.230> potato<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.150> try<00:02:17.150> not<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.329> be

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
your sweet potato is so try not to be

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.199 
your sweet potato is so try not to be
too<00:02:17.510> literal<00:02:17.900> with<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.410> measurements<00:02:19.209> make

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
too literal with the measurements make

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.330 
too literal with the measurements make
sure<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.510> look<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:20.900> what<00:02:21.890> you're<00:02:22.040> stirring

it looks like flakes and I use it for

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.530 
it looks like flakes and I use it for
seasoning<00:02:59.769> probably<00:03:00.769> nuf<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.940> has<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> bit<00:03:02.359> of<00:03:02.480> a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
seasoning probably nuf it has a bit of a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.319 
seasoning probably nuf it has a bit of a
cheesy<00:03:02.840> salty<00:03:03.650> kind<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.100> flavor<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.090> if<00:03:05.209> you

cheesy salty kind of flavor so if you

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.960 
cheesy salty kind of flavor so if you

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
don't have any nutritional yeast if you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.330 
don't have any nutritional yeast if you
can't<00:03:08.150> find<00:03:08.420> any<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.780> store<00:03:09.109> you<00:03:10.100> can<00:03:10.220> just

can't find any in the store you can just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.569 
can't find any in the store you can just
leave<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.549> out<00:03:10.609> it's<00:03:10.970> not<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.209> big<00:03:11.420> deal<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:13.519> is

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
leave that out it's not a big deal it is

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.670 
leave that out it's not a big deal it is
called<00:03:14.030> nutritional<00:03:14.810> yeast<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.290> some<00:03:15.410> people

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
called nutritional yeast and some people

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.930 
called nutritional yeast and some people
say<00:03:15.859> it<00:03:15.980> has<00:03:16.010> nutritional<00:03:16.639> benefits<00:03:17.060> but

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
say it has nutritional benefits but

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.440 
say it has nutritional benefits but
there's<00:03:19.940> some<00:03:20.209> debate<00:03:20.510> about<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.440> I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
there's some debate about that and I

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.120 
there's some debate about that and I
don't<00:03:23.450> use<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.720> for<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.109> nutritional<00:03:24.709> reason<00:03:25.040> I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
don't use it for a nutritional reason I

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.809 
don't use it for a nutritional reason I
use<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.430> for<00:03:25.579> flavor<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.950> again<00:03:27.950> don't<00:03:28.459> feel

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
use it for flavor so again don't feel

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.050 
use it for flavor so again don't feel
that<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.870> necessary<00:03:30.760> last<00:03:31.760> thing<00:03:31.970> I'm

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
that that is necessary last thing I'm

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.030 
that that is necessary last thing I'm
going<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.269> put<00:03:32.389> in<00:03:32.480> here<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.930> some<00:03:33.230> salt

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040

stir<00:03:45.849> that<00:03:46.030> around<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.560> then<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.220> need

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
stir that around and then you just need

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.050 
stir that around and then you just need
to<00:03:48.549> form<00:03:48.939> this<00:03:49.060> into<00:03:49.360> patties<00:03:49.689> and<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.829> can<00:03:51.129> do

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to form this into patties and you can do

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.000 
to form this into patties and you can do
these<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.420> frying<00:03:52.659> pan<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:53.799> them<00:03:53.980> in

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
these in a frying pan you can do them in

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.069 
these in a frying pan you can do them in
the<00:03:54.310> oven<00:03:54.670> what<00:03:55.510> I'm<00:03:55.629> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.780> do<00:03:55.930> is

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
the oven what I'm going to do is

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.809 
the oven what I'm going to do is
actually<00:03:56.200> put<00:03:56.650> them<00:03:56.799> on<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.430> cookie<00:03:57.640> sheet

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
actually put them on a cookie sheet

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.940 
actually put them on a cookie sheet
that's<00:03:58.659> lined<00:03:58.810> with<00:03:59.170> parchment<00:03:59.290> paper<00:03:59.680> and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
that's lined with parchment paper and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.520 
that's lined with parchment paper and
put<00:04:00.099> them<00:04:00.220> on<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.370> bar<00:04:00.519> cube<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:02.079> could<00:04:02.290> try

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
put them on the bar cube you could try

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.050 
put them on the bar cube you could try
them<00:04:02.680> straight<00:04:03.010> on<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.220> grill<00:04:03.400> but<00:04:03.700> they<00:04:03.879> are

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
them straight on the grill but they are

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.210 
them straight on the grill but they are
a<00:04:04.450> little<00:04:05.260> bit<00:04:05.500> soft

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
a little bit soft

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.099 
a little bit soft
they'll<00:04:06.579> probably<00:04:06.760> stick<00:04:07.420> that's<00:04:07.720> my<00:04:07.900> main

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
they'll probably stick that's my main

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.020 
they'll probably stick that's my main
concern<00:04:08.769> so<00:04:09.280> I'm<00:04:09.370> putting<00:04:09.579> them<00:04:09.760> on<00:04:09.879> the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
concern so I'm putting them on the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.940 
concern so I'm putting them on the
parchment<00:04:10.239> paper<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:10.930> that<00:04:10.989> they<00:04:11.170> don't<00:04:11.349> they

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
parchment paper so that they don't they

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.500 
parchment paper so that they don't they
don't<00:04:12.640> stick<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.510> cookie<00:04:14.319> sheet

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
don't stick to the cookie sheet

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.509 
don't stick to the cookie sheet
okay<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.570> I've<00:04:16.870> lit<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.260> grill<00:04:17.470> let<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.280> heat

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
okay so I've lit the grill let it heat

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.320 
okay so I've lit the grill let it heat
up<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.880> then<00:04:20.160> brush<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.340> off<00:04:21.459> I've<00:04:22.120> got<00:04:22.180> my

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
up and then brush it off I've got my

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.300 
up and then brush it off I've got my
burgers<00:04:25.330> ready<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.690> go<00:04:25.840> right<00:04:26.080> here<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.530> like

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
burgers ready to go right here and like

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.520 
burgers ready to go right here and like
I<00:04:27.340> said<00:04:27.580> I've<00:04:27.760> put<00:04:27.970> them<00:04:28.120> on<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> sheet<00:04:28.660> with

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
I said I've put them on a sheet with

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.090 
I said I've put them on a sheet with
some<00:04:29.710> paper<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:31.090> can<00:04:31.270> see<00:04:31.800> with<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.949> oats

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
some paper and you can see with the oats

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.070 
some paper and you can see with the oats
these<00:04:33.580> guys<00:04:33.789> really<00:04:34.090> hold<00:04:34.449> their<00:04:34.630> shape<00:04:34.660> well

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
these guys really hold their shape well

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.790 
these guys really hold their shape well
but<00:04:35.979> the<00:04:36.100> reason<00:04:36.400> I'm<00:04:36.520> putting<00:04:36.699> this<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:37.150> a

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
but the reason I'm putting this on a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.189 
but the reason I'm putting this on a
sheet<00:04:38.800> on<00:04:38.979> paper<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.669> because<00:04:40.599> they<00:04:40.900> tend<00:04:41.110> to

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
sheet on paper is because they tend to

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.500 
sheet on paper is because they tend to
stick<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.160> want<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.699> do<00:04:42.820> them<00:04:43.000> right<00:04:43.330> on

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
stick if you want to do them right on

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.330

okay<00:04:48.430> depending<00:04:49.210> on<00:04:49.470> how<00:04:50.470> much<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.770> watch

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
okay depending on how much you watch

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:51.990 
okay depending on how much you watch
them<00:04:51.220> you'll<00:04:51.340> need<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.610> flip<00:04:51.820> them<00:04:51.970> halfway

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
them you'll need to flip them halfway

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.659 
them you'll need to flip them halfway
through<00:04:52.570> but<00:04:53.289> these<00:04:53.860> guys<00:04:54.070> I'm<00:04:54.310> just<00:04:54.490> going<00:04:54.639> to

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
through but these guys I'm just going to

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.100 
through but these guys I'm just going to
actually<00:04:54.849> put<00:04:55.240> them<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.630> top<00:04:55.840> shelf

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
actually put them on the top shelf

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.350 
actually put them on the top shelf
because<00:04:57.039> I'm<00:04:57.190> going<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.400> grill<00:04:57.580> some<00:04:57.880> veggies

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
because I'm going to grill some veggies

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.129 
because I'm going to grill some veggies
on<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.720> bottom<00:04:59.110> and<00:05:00.539> what<00:05:01.539> you<00:05:01.630> can<00:05:01.750> do<00:05:01.930> is

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
on the bottom and what you can do is

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.040 
on the bottom and what you can do is
then<00:05:02.410> close<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.400> lid<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.789> it's<00:05:04.780> basically

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
then close the lid and it's basically

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.990 
then close the lid and it's basically
like<00:05:05.229> they're<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.620> oven<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.130> if<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.849> have

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
like they're in the oven and if you have

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.490 
like they're in the oven and if you have
a<00:05:07.030> temperature<00:05:07.539> gauge<00:05:07.690> that's<00:05:07.990> awesome

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
a temperature gauge that's awesome

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.200 
a temperature gauge that's awesome
because<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:09.220> don't<00:05:09.460> want<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.699> to<00:05:09.820> get<00:05:09.940> too<00:05:10.180> hot

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
because you don't want it to get too hot

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.250 
because you don't want it to get too hot
in<00:05:10.720> there<00:05:11.520> I'd<00:05:12.520> say<00:05:12.580> somewhere<00:05:13.090> around<00:05:13.300> 400

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
in there I'd say somewhere around 400

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.680 
in there I'd say somewhere around 400
degrees<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:15.729> if<00:05:16.180> you're<00:05:16.300> doing<00:05:16.389> it<00:05:16.539> in<00:05:16.599> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
degrees and if you're doing it in the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.820 
degrees and if you're doing it in the
oven<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.050> can<00:05:17.260> do<00:05:17.380> 350<00:05:18.090> frying<00:05:19.090> pan<00:05:19.330> just

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
oven you can do 350 frying pan just

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.890 
oven you can do 350 frying pan just
medium-high<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.880> they'll<00:05:22.330> stay<00:05:22.570> in<00:05:22.599> there

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
medium-high so they'll stay in there

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.570 
medium-high so they'll stay in there
until<00:05:23.110> they're<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.530> little<00:05:23.919> bit<00:05:24.099> crisp<00:05:24.370> on<00:05:24.550> the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
until they're a little bit crisp on the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.230 
until they're a little bit crisp on the
outside<00:05:26.430> we'll<00:05:27.430> see<00:05:27.580> how<00:05:27.669> long<00:05:27.729> that<00:05:27.880> takes

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
outside we'll see how long that takes

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.110 
outside we'll see how long that takes
for<00:05:28.570> me<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:28.870> then<00:05:28.960> I'll<00:05:29.080> let<00:05:29.169> you<00:05:29.229> know<00:05:29.320> and

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
for me and then I'll let you know and

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.010 
for me and then I'll let you know and
like<00:05:31.120> I<00:05:31.240> said<00:05:31.300> I'm<00:05:31.570> going<00:05:31.659> to<00:05:31.720> do<00:05:31.810> some

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020

vegetables<00:05:32.440> at<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.740> same<00:05:32.919> time<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.370> go<00:05:33.460> along

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
vegetables at the same time to go along

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.089 
vegetables at the same time to go along
with<00:05:33.760> these<00:05:34.120> burgers<00:05:34.389> because<00:05:35.260> I<00:05:35.289> don't<00:05:35.979> like

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
with these burgers because I don't like

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.990 
with these burgers because I don't like
to<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:37.120> waste<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.780> BBQ<00:05:38.590> time

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
to to waste the BBQ time

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.180 
to to waste the BBQ time
