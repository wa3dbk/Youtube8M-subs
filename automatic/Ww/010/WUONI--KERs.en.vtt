00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
important figure here which is the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.740 
important figure here which is the
weekly<00:01:25.170> interest<00:01:25.920> payments<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> loan<00:01:27.030> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
loan is one hundred and fifty thousand

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.390 
loan is one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars<00:01:30.030> paying<00:01:30.810> 9%<00:01:31.079> interest<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> low

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
dollars paying 9% interest which is low

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.770 
dollars paying 9% interest which is low
for<00:01:33.240> commercial<00:01:33.960> loans<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.630> working<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
out that would be two hundred and sixty

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.289 
out that would be two hundred and sixty
dollars<00:01:38.759> per<00:01:39.119> week<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.380> let's<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> look<00:01:40.950> at

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
dollars per week so let's have a look at

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.410 
dollars per week so let's have a look at
some<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> events<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> caused<00:01:44.420> business

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
some of the events that caused business

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960 
some of the events that caused business
to<00:01:45.689> drop<00:01:46.200> into<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> loss<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.399> we're

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
to drop into a loss you can see we're

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
to drop into a loss you can see we're
right<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.210> break-even<00:01:48.570> point<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.829> a

hundred<00:01:55.770> customers<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> week<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> course<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hundred customers a week of course that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.609 
hundred customers a week of course that
would<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> difference<00:01:58.200> wouldn't<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
would make a difference wouldn't it that

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.359 
would make a difference wouldn't it that
would<00:01:58.920> move<00:01:59.100> us<00:01:59.280> into<00:01:59.610> a<00:02:00.950> profit<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.130> let's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
would move us into a profit but let's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.170 
would move us into a profit but let's
leave<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.939> break-even<00:02:03.270> point<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
leave it on break-even point and it's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.960 
leave it on break-even point and it's
usually<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.469> problems<00:02:08.190> start<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> arise

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720 
usually the problems start to arise
because<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.750> few<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.530> enough<00:02:10.770> customers<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
because a few not enough customers and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.700 
because a few not enough customers and
they're<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.030> spending<00:02:12.239> as<00:02:12.599> much<00:02:12.629> as<00:02:12.959> expected

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
they're not spending as much as expected

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.460 
they're not spending as much as expected
if<00:02:13.770> our<00:02:13.980> customers<00:02:14.460> went<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.150> 900<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.290> week

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
if our customers went down to 900 a week

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.460 
if our customers went down to 900 a week
maybe<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.550> quiet<00:02:18.030> week<00:02:18.330> cold<00:02:18.780> or<00:02:18.990> wear<00:02:19.200> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
maybe it's a quiet week cold or wear to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.980 
maybe it's a quiet week cold or wear to
whatever<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.910> moves<00:02:21.240> us<00:02:21.540> into

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
whatever you can see that moves us into

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.890 
whatever you can see that moves us into
a<00:02:22.020> loss<00:02:22.350> or<00:02:22.820> maybe<00:02:23.820> they're<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.450> spend

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
a loss or maybe they're going to spend

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
a loss or maybe they're going to spend
less<00:02:25.260> money<00:02:25.710> because<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.850> tight<00:02:27.090> economic

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
less money because of tight economic

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.380 
less money because of tight economic
conditions<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.470> moves<00:02:29.370> us<00:02:29.520> into<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> loss<00:02:30.120> as

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
conditions that moves us into a loss as

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
conditions that moves us into a loss as
well<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:30.900> had<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> two<00:02:31.470> things<00:02:31.800> together

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
well if we had the two things together

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.020 
well if we had the two things together
that<00:02:32.640> gets<00:02:33.630> even<00:02:33.960> more<00:02:33.990> painful<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> let's

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
that gets even more painful so let's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.450 
that gets even more painful so let's
leave<00:02:39.030> those<00:02:39.320> reduced<00:02:40.320> figures<00:02:40.800> there<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.430> I

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
leave those reduced figures there but I

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.480 
leave those reduced figures there but I
now<00:02:41.820> particularly<00:02:42.540> want<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.870> look<00:02:43.200> at<00:02:43.490> my

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
now particularly want to look at my

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.700 
now particularly want to look at my
concerns<00:02:44.970> around<00:02:45.480> these<00:02:45.690> fixed<00:02:46.200> costs

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
concerns around these fixed costs

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.160 
concerns around these fixed costs
because<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.340> my<00:02:47.520> experience<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.870> see<00:02:48.990> how

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
because in my experience you can see how

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.040 
because in my experience you can see how
our<00:02:49.440> rent<00:02:50.250> cost<00:02:50.670> which<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.180> percentage<00:02:51.990> of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
our rent cost which is a percentage of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.580 
our rent cost which is a percentage of
sales<00:02:53.040> has<00:02:53.580> gone<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.910> think<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.570> started<00:02:54.930> off<00:02:55.110> at

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
sales has gone I think it started off at

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.830 
sales has gone I think it started off at
about<00:02:56.280> twelve<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.090> half<00:02:57.120> percent<00:02:57.240> we're

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
about twelve and a half percent we're

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.600 
about twelve and a half percent we're
now<00:02:57.990> up<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.590> than<00:02:58.620> half<00:02:58.860> 14<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> half

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
now up to more than half 14 and a half

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.840 
now up to more than half 14 and a half
percent<00:03:01.010> benchmark<00:03:02.010> should<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.640> six

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
percent benchmark should be in the six

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.210 
percent benchmark should be in the six
to<00:03:02.970> eight<00:03:03.210> percent<00:03:03.420> figure<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.500> very

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
to eight percent figure this is very

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.220 
to eight percent figure this is very
high<00:03:05.490> remember<00:03:06.060> there's<00:03:06.240> only<00:03:06.330> 100<00:03:06.780> cents<00:03:07.020> in

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
high remember there's only 100 cents in

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.130 
high remember there's only 100 cents in
the<00:03:07.260> dollar<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.300> fourteen<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.480> half<00:03:09.630> cents

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the dollar and fourteen and a half cents

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.380 
the dollar and fourteen and a half cents
is<00:03:10.260> already<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.130> our<00:03:11.250> occupation<00:03:11.940> costs

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
is already going on our occupation costs

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.330 
is already going on our occupation costs
so<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.770> one<00:03:14.130> figure<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.930> need<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.470> be

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
so that is one figure that we need to be

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.860 
so that is one figure that we need to be
concerned<00:03:17.790> about<00:03:17.940> I'm<00:03:18.240> going<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.450> highlight

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
concerned about I'm going to highlight

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.610 
concerned about I'm going to highlight
that<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.320> red<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:20.750> one<00:03:21.750> reason<00:03:22.020> one<00:03:22.530> of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that in red that is one reason one of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.740 
that in red that is one reason one of
the<00:03:22.680> main<00:03:22.860> reasons<00:03:23.310> why<00:03:23.580> businesses<00:03:24.150> go<00:03:24.420> broke

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the main reasons why businesses go broke

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.350 
the main reasons why businesses go broke
they<00:03:25.380> may<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:25.890> be<00:03:26.010> very<00:03:26.160> efficient<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.970> here

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
they may not be very efficient up here

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.150 
they may not be very efficient up here
in<00:03:27.510> their<00:03:27.630> variable<00:03:28.140> costs<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:29.010> they've

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
in their variable costs but they've

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.780 
in their variable costs but they've
signed<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.760> lease<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.430> too

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
signed a lease that is just too

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.460 
signed a lease that is just too
expensive<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.660> cost<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.140> paying<00:03:34.350> that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
expensive and the cost of paying that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.790 
expensive and the cost of paying that
week<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:35.010> week<00:03:35.220> out<00:03:35.420> becomes<00:03:36.800> unaffordable

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
week in week out becomes unaffordable

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.040 
week in week out becomes unaffordable
the<00:03:38.640> other<00:03:38.790> one<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.330> loan<00:03:40.320> costs<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:42.050> you

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
the other one is loan costs here and you

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.480 
the other one is loan costs here and you
can<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.380> we've<00:03:43.560> got<00:03:43.680> two<00:03:43.860> hundred<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.160> sixty

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
can see we've got two hundred and sixty

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.480 
can see we've got two hundred and sixty
dollars<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.820> week<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.680> interest<00:03:46.680> payments<00:03:47.220> here

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
dollars a week of interest payments here

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.440 
dollars a week of interest payments here
that's<00:03:48.020> not<00:03:49.020> insignificant<00:03:49.350> for<00:03:50.190> sales<00:03:51.150> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
that's not insignificant for sales of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.830 
that's not insignificant for sales of
below<00:03:51.750> eight<00:03:51.990> thousand<00:03:52.500> dollars<00:03:52.860> here<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
below eight thousand dollars here and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.140 
below eight thousand dollars here and
that's<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.080> a<00:03:55.110> loan<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.010> hundred<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.730> fifty

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that's on a loan of a hundred and fifty

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.370 
that's on a loan of a hundred and fifty
thousand<00:03:57.750> dollars<00:03:59.660> paying<00:04:00.660> nine<00:04:00.960> percent

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
thousand dollars paying nine percent

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.410 
thousand dollars paying nine percent
interest<00:04:01.830> but<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.730> my<00:04:02.850> experience<00:04:03.360> people

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
interest but in my experience people

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.780 
interest but in my experience people
usually<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:04.080> borrowed<00:04:04.800> much<00:04:05.250> more<00:04:05.580> than

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
usually have borrowed much more than

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.620 
usually have borrowed much more than
that

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.560 
that
what<00:04:07.050> if<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.800> four<00:04:08.550> hundred<00:04:09.030> thousand

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
what if that was four hundred thousand

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.460 
what if that was four hundred thousand
dollars<00:04:11.390> what's<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.690> look<00:04:12.930> like

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
dollars what's that look like

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.860 
dollars what's that look like
on<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.590> weekly<00:04:14.190> basis<00:04:14.670> well<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.330> pretty

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
on a weekly basis well that's pretty

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.530 
on a weekly basis well that's pretty
difficult<00:04:16.710> isn't<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.090> know<00:04:18.180> even<00:04:18.450> if

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
difficult isn't it so you know even if
