00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
one to find it and obviously it's a very

one to find it and obviously it's a very
easy<00:00:44.499> one<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.949> find<00:00:45.219> all<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.820> gotta<00:00:46.030> do<00:00:46.149> is<00:00:46.179> go

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
easy one to find all you gotta do is go

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.500 
easy one to find all you gotta do is go
on<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:47.050> think<00:00:47.320> it's<00:00:47.440> Express

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
on I think it's Express

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.389 
on I think it's Express
standoff<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.929> turbine<00:00:50.679> those<00:00:50.980> three<00:00:51.159> maps

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
standoff and turbine those three maps

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.470 
standoff and turbine those three maps
and<00:00:51.519> there's<00:00:51.640> like<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.820> little<00:00:51.969> note<00:00:52.300> on

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
and there's like a little note on

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.329 
and there's like a little note on
calendar<00:00:53.050> where<00:00:53.319> it<00:00:53.379> says<00:00:53.589> zombies<00:00:54.039> are<00:00:54.190> cool

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
calendar where it says zombies are cool

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.470 
calendar where it says zombies are cool
so<00:00:54.579> it<00:00:54.699> was<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.819> little<00:00:54.969> bit<00:00:55.149> of<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.269> glitch

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
so it was a little bit of a glitch

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.540 
so it was a little bit of a glitch
anyway<00:00:56.140> down<00:00:56.289> to<00:00:56.350> this<00:00:56.589> one<00:00:56.859> I<00:00:56.890> don't<00:00:57.039> waste<00:00:57.399> a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550
