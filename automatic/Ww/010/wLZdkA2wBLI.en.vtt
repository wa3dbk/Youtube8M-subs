00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
inside of the lenses and you just push
out<00:00:48.960> um<00:00:49.610> it's<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.700> simple<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.449> there's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
out um it's really simple to do there's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.510 
out um it's really simple to do there's
just<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.960> groove<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.160> holds<00:00:53.430> these

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
just a groove in there that holds these

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.750 
just a groove in there that holds these
lenses<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.649> push<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
lenses in so you just push out and the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.250 
lenses in so you just push out and the
lens<00:00:56.969> comes<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:59.510> you<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> other

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
lens comes out you do that for the other

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
lens comes out you do that for the other
one<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.070> blank<00:01:05.909> frame

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
one so then you just have a blank frame

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
one so then you just have a blank frame
with<00:01:06.570> no<00:01:06.780> lenses<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:09.570> put<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> lenses<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.650> i

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
with no lenses to put the lenses in i

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
with no lenses to put the lenses in i
mean<00:01:11.369> basically<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.420> snap<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.930> type

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
mean basically it's just a snap in type

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.890 
mean basically it's just a snap in type
of<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.150> usually<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> start<00:01:15.720> with

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
of thing you just usually I start with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.039 
of thing you just usually I start with
the<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.229> end<00:01:17.360> let<00:01:18.360> me<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.869> show

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the back end let me see if I can show

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.760 
the back end let me see if I can show
you<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.320> better<00:01:20.509> put<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> back<00:01:22.290> end<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you this better put the back end in

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.640 
you this better put the back end in
first<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.750> push<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> rest<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
first and then you just push the rest of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
first and then you just push the rest of
the<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:26.479> around<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> lens<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.100> pops<00:01:29.400> into

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the way around the lens and it pops into

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
the way around the lens and it pops into
place<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.450> definitely<00:01:31.170> hear<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> snap

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470

one<00:01:36.020> put<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> back<00:01:37.320> end<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:39.110> snap<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> into

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
one put the back end and snap it into

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.880

you know I just like to change them up a
little<00:02:18.420> bit<00:02:18.690> every<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.380> give

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
little bit every now and then to give

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.470

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
myself a different look

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.090 
myself a different look
I<00:02:21.510> think<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> chrome<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:24.800> with<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.950> red

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
I think the chrome with the with the red

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.540 
I think the chrome with the with the red
frames<00:02:26.400> looks<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.910> cool<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.340> can

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
frames looks kind of cool so you can

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820 
frames looks kind of cool so you can
kind<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.760> play<00:02:29.940> around<00:02:30.090> with<00:02:30.330> what<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.630> got<00:02:30.830> um

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
kind of play around with what you got um

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.010 
kind of play around with what you got um
it's<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.430> easy<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.330> mean<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.840> takes

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
it's really easy to do I mean this takes

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's really easy to do I mean this takes
a<00:02:34.200> second<00:02:34.620> again<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:34.980> I'll<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.160> pop<00:02:35.340> these

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
a second again here I'll just pop these

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.070 
a second again here I'll just pop these
out<00:02:35.640> again<00:02:37.610> lay<00:02:38.610> them<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.840> even

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
out again lay them down you can even

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.390 
out again lay them down you can even
throw<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.410> chrome<00:02:42.470> chrome<00:02:43.470> lenses<00:02:43.860> into<00:02:44.070> this

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
throw the chrome chrome lenses into this

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.930 
throw the chrome chrome lenses into this
frame<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:46.100> then<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.220> way<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.580> play<00:02:47.730> off

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
frame and then that way you can play off

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.480 
frame and then that way you can play off
of<00:02:48.150> how<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.900> polished<00:02:49.590> chrome<00:02:49.890> O's

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
of how you have the polished chrome O's

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.390 
of how you have the polished chrome O's
the<00:02:51.030> O's<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.230> mean<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> polished<00:02:53.220> chrome

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the O's I mean the polished chrome

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.729 
the O's I mean the polished chrome
rivets<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.450> polished<00:02:54.780> chrome<00:02:54.989> lens<00:02:55.290> so

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
rivets and a polished chrome lens so

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.340 
rivets and a polished chrome lens so
then<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.040> all<00:02:56.280> together<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.140> same

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
then it's all together all the same

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.100 
then it's all together all the same
thing<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.150> that's<00:03:00.150> also<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.480> cool<00:03:00.720> combo
