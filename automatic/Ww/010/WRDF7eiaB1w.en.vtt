00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:12.389
 ado.net exhausted from bullets as the first thing 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.030
 important to do with any signal the most 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 the very first action that I pay 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.580
 attention figure 1 is in necessarily 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.270
 okay market evaluation us then yourself 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.179
 describe 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:35.850
 what is the first necessary action assessment 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:39.629
 market direction estimate and here it is very 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.559
 the important moment is what you are now 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 you are if a cache break is possible 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.410
 trade manipulations if you are 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 in the deal and against you now appears 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.840
 signal from 1 is not a reason to fold 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:06.150
 your position needs to be evaluated up against 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:08.189
 you when we have any 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.760
 signal but in this case we have signals 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.140
 aptrast 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.580
 and if we have a market assessment suggests 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 what is going now is long on aptrast should 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:27.960
 ignored if you are just 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.409
 in by deal and your wish is just 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600
 do it and try it here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.170
 make decisions about what you will with 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.070
 make it, that is, take it and just 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.820
 enter into it the market assessment is to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.689
 what you find in what wave you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.409
 Now there is a need to evaluate the market 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.020
 spread out 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.570
 one second for buyers such 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.619
 for sellers if we take a look 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.790
 on our schedule 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.869
 give it we lay out what we take the most 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.600
 we have the last one second wave 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.600
 which we safely pierced 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.549
 here from us lined up wave down and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.690
 we punched her so that we did not have 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.340
 here sales ie sales top on 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.459
 which were supposed to protect this 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.410
 level 1 2 they simply were not in 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.250
 we have the same time all the time 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.900
 rises mini and movement that is, we 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.239
 by broken 1 2 last from sellers 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.299
 we now determine what we are now 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.430
 are upward movement 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.360
 if we are in a deal here with us 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.739
 were springen right here we had 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:55.019
 dough action with dough and which 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:59.519
 It turned out gps that's when the purchase was 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.040
 after the breakdown of lps with a test in this 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.810
 if you had a presence in 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.519
 the transaction itself the appearance of an up-trust 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.879
 Of course you should be alerted you should 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.980
 give it a rating then it all depends on 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.069
 what you are now 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.019
 if you are in a deal then evaluate this 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.790
 aptrast 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.190
 how deep will he go like that 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.669
 the level was previously tested 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.410
 see and the volume is one volume 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.250
 now we come up with a smaller 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.169
 volume to this to the same level 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.109
 just take it and logically try it 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.480
 consider comparing the leopard bar volume with 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.060
 the amount of time to compare all that is possible 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.980
 stuff you start to compare 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.970
 among themselves here is just building 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.380
 his logical chain of thoughts 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.079
 if you are in the cache 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.900
 I recommend all the same here at this stage 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.299
 at the initial stage to trade everything 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.489
 That is, the principle of the track is pretty much the same 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:04.340
 safe signals that give good 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.340
 deal with a good spark board
