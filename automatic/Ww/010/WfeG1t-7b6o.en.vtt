00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's perfect right inside everyone this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's perfect right inside everyone this
one<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:41.130> i<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:43.340> threw<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:44.700> by

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
one that i have i threw that in there by

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
one that i have i threw that in there by
the<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.280> hard

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the way it was actually really hard

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
the way it was actually really hard
because<00:01:48.420> most<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> time<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> shows<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
because most of the time it shows in and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.670 
because most of the time it shows in and
it<00:01:50.490> hits<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> bounces<00:01:51.930> off<00:01:52.880> but

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
it hits and then it bounces off but

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.500 
it hits and then it bounces off but
once<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.850> stick<00:01:56.180> them<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.720> slot<00:01:57.380> I<00:01:58.510> didn't

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
once you stick them in the slot I didn't

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.900 
once you stick them in the slot I didn't
want<00:02:00.050> to<00:02:00.110> glue<00:02:00.380> these<00:02:00.560> down<00:02:00.890> since<00:02:01.370> my<00:02:01.550> dad's<00:02:01.760> a

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
want to glue these down since my dad's a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.760 
want to glue these down since my dad's a
contractor<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.630> I'm<00:02:02.960> borrowing<00:02:03.560> these

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
contractor and I'm borrowing these

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.870 
contractor and I'm borrowing these
basically<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.480> I<00:02:05.510> got<00:02:05.930> some<00:02:06.380> duct<00:02:06.680> tape<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.220> I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
basically so I got some duct tape and I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.230 
basically so I got some duct tape and I
duct-taped<00:02:08.390> them<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:10.429> did<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.850> fairly

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
duct-taped them in and I did it fairly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.750 
duct-taped them in and I did it fairly
quick<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.770> tell<00:02:13.160> some<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.490> them

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
quick so you can tell some of them

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.210 
quick so you can tell some of them
there's<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.750> paper<00:02:14.959> some<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.950> them<00:02:16.070> are

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
there's the paper some of them are

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.270 
there's the paper some of them are
longer<00:02:16.580> than<00:02:16.820> others<00:02:17.530> they're<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.860> equal

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
longer than others they're all the equal

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.690 
longer than others they're all the equal
distance<00:02:19.760> from<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.320> thing<00:02:21.320> but<00:02:21.709> some<00:02:22.459> duct

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
distance from the thing but some duct

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.910 
distance from the thing but some duct
tape<00:02:22.790> comes<00:02:23.330> out<00:02:23.510> farther<00:02:24.820> anyway<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.709> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
tape comes out farther anyway now that I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.250 
tape comes out farther anyway now that I
have<00:02:28.130> him<00:02:28.250> duct-taped<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.970> there<00:02:29.570> fairly

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
have him duct-taped in there fairly

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.250 
have him duct-taped in there fairly
secure<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.160> then<00:02:31.430> after<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> duct-taped<00:02:32.989> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
secure and then after I duct-taped and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.520 
secure and then after I duct-taped and
wrapped<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.920> around<00:02:34.040> knees<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.750> decided<00:02:36.170> to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
wrapped it around knees and I decided to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.370 
wrapped it around knees and I decided to
crisscross<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:38.560> hold<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.190> paper<00:02:40.480> steady<00:02:41.480> so

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
crisscross and hold the paper steady so
