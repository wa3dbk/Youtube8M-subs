instead the best thing to do is simply

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.330 
instead the best thing to do is simply
file<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> tips<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> point<00:01:29.009> where

some people have used concrete branches
and<00:01:42.810> purchase<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.729> in

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and purchase like the kind you see in

effective<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.000> sugar<00:01:48.299> gliders<00:01:49.640> instead<00:01:50.640> it's

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
effective on sugar gliders instead it's

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.149 
effective on sugar gliders instead it's
much<00:01:51.359> better<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.869> either<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.530> file<00:01:52.890> them

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
much better to either just file them
