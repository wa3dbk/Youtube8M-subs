00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.089
 the summary here my name is pedro de lara e 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.970
 I'm going to have a complicated surgery today. 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.980
 will remove the rotten heart from this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.529
 patient put a new 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 the first thing to do is to remove this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 green towel here from above you too 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.360
 can use to cover the patient has 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.680
 people who do not like to see blood 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.540
 ready ready fucking 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.540
 someone passed super bonder here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 Now, let's continue with the surgery. 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.510
 The second thing I do is fix the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510
 my table 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.340
 now it's the way I like it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.270
 work just need to separate some more 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.750
 items from the other side this does not 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.580
 This can even be used for 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 replace the current green line 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.560
 Look how fucking served that shit. 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.130
 I'll leave this glass here and this radinho 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.170
 also because he is cool 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.990
 Now I need to start the surgery, but 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 I'll check first if the patient is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 sleeping 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.390
 I put my finger on the club and I'll see if he 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.659
 wake up with the smell did not wake up yet 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.790
 under anesthesia then I go 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.780
 choose this tool first 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.780
 cut the bones 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.970
 I think it did not work 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.630
 but, no problem, I'll choose another 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:12.910
 tool of my finally this hammer 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.210
 It will be to see what I need to just knock 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.640
 a little well and ready 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.400
 We have already opened the way to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.650
 little heart 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.320
 the next step is to take all this junk 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.690
 what is disturbing 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.120
 these two brains here can throw away 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.690
 because we will not use 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.600
 I will actually keep one and the bones 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.740

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.740

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.330

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.290
 We'll have to take him out of there. 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.150

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.730

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.500

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.620

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.390
