when<00:00:12.030> our<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> lodges<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
when our at the lodges here at the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.400 
when our at the lodges here at the
Annapurna<00:00:14.610> base<00:00:14.880> camp<00:00:15.389> four<00:00:15.839> thousand<00:00:16.320> one

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
Annapurna base camp four thousand one

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.590 
Annapurna base camp four thousand one
hundred<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.770> thirty<00:00:17.010> meters<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
hundred and thirty meters and now the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
hundred and thirty meters and now the
trick<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> base<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> wall

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
trick is to get to the base of the wall

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.300 
trick is to get to the base of the wall
we're<00:00:20.730> gonna<00:00:20.880> start<00:00:21.180> our<00:00:21.270> climbing<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we're gonna start our climbing and the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.950 
we're gonna start our climbing and the
way<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> go

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
way that we do that is we have to go

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
way that we do that is we have to go
down<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.350> steep<00:00:25.619> angled<00:00:26.099> slope<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
down the steep angled slope that is just

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
down the steep angled slope that is just
off<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> edge<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> lodges<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.039> just

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
off the edge of the lodges here just

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.849 
off the edge of the lodges here just
down<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.849> moraine<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:31.170> 100

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
down in the moraine it's about 100

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.740 
down in the moraine it's about 100
meters<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> bottom<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
meters down so we get to the bottom of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
meters down so we get to the bottom of
the<00:00:33.870> glacier<00:00:34.050> we've<00:00:34.440> got<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> traverse<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the glacier we've got to traverse the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.889 
the glacier we've got to traverse the
bottom<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.059> glacier<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> way<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
bottom of glacier all the way to the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.860 
bottom of glacier all the way to the
other<00:00:37.020> side<00:00:37.520> once<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
other side once we get down to the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.709 
other side once we get down to the
glacier<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:41.160> covered<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:41.879> rocks<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> from

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
glacier it's covered with rocks and from

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.060 
glacier it's covered with rocks and from
here<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> doesn't<00:00:43.230> even<00:00:43.410> look<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.800> ice<00:00:44.040> but

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
here it doesn't even look like ice but

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
here it doesn't even look like ice but
when<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.969> into<00:00:45.149> monks<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> rocks<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
when you get into monks the rocks and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.440 
when you get into monks the rocks and
the<00:00:46.350> rubble<00:00:46.649> down<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:47.430> top<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.329> ice

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the rubble down on top of the the ice

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.360 
the rubble down on top of the the ice
you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.260> there's<00:00:49.440> big<00:00:49.620> caves<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can see that there's big caves and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.660 
you can see that there's big caves and
caverns<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.629> small<00:00:52.170> rivers<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.520> get

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
caverns and small rivers then we get

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
caverns and small rivers then we get
over<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> other<00:00:54.809> side<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
over to the to the other side of the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
over to the to the other side of the
glacier<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.210> call<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
glacier and we have what we call the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
glacier and we have what we call the
dirt<00:00:57.660> wall<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.649> hundred<00:00:59.070> meter<00:00:59.250> high

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
dirt wall which is a hundred meter high

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
dirt wall which is a hundred meter high
wall<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.480> dirt<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.079> constantly<00:01:01.739> raining

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
wall of dirt that's constantly raining

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.439 
wall of dirt that's constantly raining
rocks<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.789> top<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> us

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
rocks down on top of us

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
rocks down on top of us
and<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> could<00:01:04.110> hear<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.680> behind

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and if you could hear right now behind

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.270 
and if you could hear right now behind
me<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.369> could<00:01:05.489> hear<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.570> constant<00:01:07.280> falling

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
me you could hear the constant falling

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
me you could hear the constant falling
of<00:01:08.400> rocks<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.939> dirt<00:01:09.150> coming<00:01:09.600> down<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.080> ice

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
of rocks of dirt coming down of ice

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
of rocks of dirt coming down of ice
coming<00:01:10.530> down<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.340> pretty<00:01:11.520> noisy<00:01:11.790> once<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
coming down it's pretty noisy once you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.210 
coming down it's pretty noisy once you
get<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.810> over<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> other<00:01:13.350> side<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.830> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
get get over to the other side but we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
get get over to the other side but we
found<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.640> pretty<00:01:14.820> safe<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> center<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
found a pretty safe way up the center of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
found a pretty safe way up the center of
it<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.700> 100<00:01:18.240> meters<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.570> 300

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it and we go up about 100 meters or 300

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.530 
it and we go up about 100 meters or 300
feet<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.920> flat<00:01:20.640> plateau<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
feet up that to this flat plateau and

some of the some of the expedition's in
the<00:01:24.390> past<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.930> had<00:01:24.960> their<00:01:25.380> base<00:01:25.680> camp<00:01:25.710> over

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the past have had their base camp over

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
the past have had their base camp over
there<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.640> might<00:01:26.820> set<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.240> our<00:01:27.420> base<00:01:27.600> camp

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
there and we might set up our base camp

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770 
there and we might set up our base camp
over<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:28.740> once<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
over there as well once all of the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
expedition members get here once aurilla

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
expedition members get here once aurilla
and<00:01:33.600> iñaki<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> Russians<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.189> we

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and iñaki and the Russians get here we

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
and iñaki and the Russians get here we
might<00:01:35.460> move<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> lodges<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
might move from the lodges over to that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
might move from the lodges over to that
area<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> lot<00:01:38.280> closer<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
area because it's a lot closer to the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.149 
area because it's a lot closer to the
wall<00:01:39.210> takes<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:39.990> three<00:01:40.350> hours<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:40.920> over

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
wall takes about three hours to get over

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
wall takes about three hours to get over
to<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.400> place<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.030> from<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.540> that's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to that place and then from there that's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.469 
to that place and then from there that's
flat<00:01:43.680> spot<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.130> traverse<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.240> black

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
flat spot we traverse the the black

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
flat spot we traverse the the black
cliffs<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.350> behind<00:01:46.500> me<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> on

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
cliffs that you can see behind me and on

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.749 
cliffs that you can see behind me and on
the<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> gentle<00:01:49.110> snow<00:01:49.560> slope<00:01:49.950> which<00:01:50.549> was

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the on a gentle snow slope which was

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.940 
the on a gentle snow slope which was
easier<00:01:51.149> last<00:01:51.479> time<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:52.590> it's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
easier last time I was here because it's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
easier last time I was here because it's
all<00:01:53.100> grass<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.869> covered

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
all grass but now because it's covered

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.100 
all grass but now because it's covered
in<00:01:55.320> ice<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.680> snow<00:01:56.090> it's<00:01:57.090> pretty<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
in ice and snow it's pretty it's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
in ice and snow it's pretty it's
significantly<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:58.799> dangerous<00:01:59.369> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
significantly more dangerous and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.730 
significantly more dangerous and
yesterday<00:02:00.240> when<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
yesterday when I was going up to the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.490 
yesterday when I was going up to the
camp<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.189> spot<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.549> had<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> wear<00:02:03.030> my

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
camp one spot I had to wear my

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.830 
camp one spot I had to wear my
fons<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.010> use<00:02:04.160> my<00:02:04.310> ice<00:02:04.460> axes<00:02:04.880> on<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.570> grass

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
fons and use my ice axes on on the grass

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.919 
fons and use my ice axes on on the grass
because<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.800> was<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.070> treacherous<00:02:07.840> doing<00:02:08.840> that

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
because it was so treacherous doing that

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.080 
because it was so treacherous doing that
Traverse<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.979> once<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:10.399> across<00:02:10.520> the

Traverse of the grass we have to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.010 
Traverse of the grass we have to
negotiate<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.790> couple<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.210> cuts<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.750> high

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
that Depot that's the last place that we

that Depot that's the last place that we

ice ball it gets pretty dangerous from
there<00:02:39.800> I've<00:02:40.550> got<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> camp<00:02:41.030> set<00:02:41.300> up<00:02:41.330> at<00:02:41.600> 5100

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
there I've got a camp set up at 5100

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.620 
there I've got a camp set up at 5100
meters<00:02:42.980> right<00:02:43.160> now<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:44.030> we're<00:02:44.150> using<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.570> as

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
meters right now and we're using that as

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.020 
meters right now and we're using that as
a<00:02:44.750> Depot<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.890> after<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> knocking<00:02:46.610> Andoria

arrived today
we'll<00:02:48.230> probably<00:02:48.410> take<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:48.830> couple<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:49.160> runs<00:02:49.340> up

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
we'll probably take a couple of runs up

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.430 
we'll probably take a couple of runs up
there<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.970> supply<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.420> depot<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.290> we'll

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
there and supply the depot so that we'll

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.670 
there and supply the depot so that we'll
get<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:52.100> position<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:52.790> good<00:02:53.390> weather<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:54.530> make
