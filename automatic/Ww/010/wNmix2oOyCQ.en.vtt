00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.269
 France has two hundred and fifty 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.830
 thousand winemakers in these conditions he 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.500
 is extremely difficult to know which 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.600
 wine choose and what to put in case me 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 I created cavissima to help 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.130
 to all those who do not know what wine 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.320
 choose well that they have neither the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.529
 storage conditions nor the place for 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.050
 storing wine the idea is to make 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.840
 access to coffee for all and for that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.580
 we put in place tools that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.100
 are extremely simple on the internet and 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.660
 especially we are calling a very big 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.210
 salmon john euvrard who is better 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 or the subjects of France and who will 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.630
 preside over the selection of wines and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.190
 manage the caf for your account in 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.710
 somehow it's your sum the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.050
 personal team quÃ©vy cima 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.240
 accompanies each of his clients 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.580
 along a five-step journey the 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.500
 wine selection advice for purchase 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.080
 the conservation of the wines and the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 surveillance of the hold the resale and the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.620
 wine delivery we do not have 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.840
 pretense as in all sellers 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.520
 online wine to have a map 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.820
 plethoric we wish ourselves 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 focus on the referent producers 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.070
 in each appellation at kerima we 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.160
 have two very distinct formulas either 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.560
 the customer does the cellar himself if he has 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 the skills to choose his wines there 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.980
 can also call on a 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.410
 advise for certain appellations 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.000
 the side of that he can also choose a 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.350
 wine subscription formula this is the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.430
 sommelier who makes his cellar 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 following a monthly subscription every 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.200
 wines we sell are kept 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.900
 on behalf of the client in a cellar 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.420
 secure so we have a first 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.979
 cellar which is located in Burgundy with a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.720
 rate which is extremely advantageous and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.520
 then delivery times that are from 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.770
 400 days order and for customers 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.170
 Parisians we recently put in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.990
 place a new cellar to be able to 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.690
 deliver customers in the daytime and 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.549
 always at no additional cost to 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.460
 meet another category of 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.090
 customers who wish to take advantage of the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.280
 value added of the Grands Crus 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
 value of the order of 4 8% per year we 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 accompany our customers on two 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.810
 investment devices in wine 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.090
 a mainstream device that is 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.100
 really easy to access and then a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.120
 custom cellar device that 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.350
 corresponds to a project of 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.850
 heritage diversification 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.390
 whatever the device we 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.459
 welcome the customer on the three 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.099
 fundamental approach which are the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.709
 wine selection monitoring the 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.480
 cellar online with a rating and other 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.709
 share the resale of wines through a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.300
 specific device 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.370
 when we have a blunder what is really 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.110
 pleasant it is to go down and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.819
 touch those bottles and watch them 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.510
 at kelly cima so we have 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.540
 reproduce that effect by creating a 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.580
 virtual cellar and therefore to be able to fair 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.920
 the bottles we have in his 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.520
 cellar and we have set up a whole 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.350
 module 2 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.650
 two online online cellar accounts 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.450
 which makes it possible to manage its purchases of 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.090
 credit his account to debit his 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.320
 to resell his wines to organize 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.780
 his deliveries etc. 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.300
 in a few years cavissima has become 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.940
 an expert in his field the media 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.590
 value advice the analyzes that 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.990
 we are doing in the mol 1 market 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.270
 million euros to put in relation 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.010
 with the 6.3 million euros that had 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.600
 been collected in 2013 so a 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.020
 28% increase 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.880
