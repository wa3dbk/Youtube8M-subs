the car he's in the passenger seat I'm
always<00:00:34.059> gonna<00:00:34.300> think<00:00:34.690> about<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:35.290> I<00:00:35.320> have

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
always gonna think about that I have

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.530 
always gonna think about that I have
potential<00:00:36.010> passengers<00:00:36.670> loved<00:00:37.120> ones<00:00:37.300> in<00:00:37.450> the

car with me

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.170 
car with me
worst<00:00:38.620> case<00:00:38.890> scenario<00:00:38.950> because<00:00:39.879> that's<00:00:40.030> going

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
worst case scenario because that's going

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.700 
worst case scenario because that's going
to<00:00:40.239> determine<00:00:40.390> on<00:00:40.719> how<00:00:40.750> I<00:00:40.960> redirect<00:00:41.620> the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
to determine on how I redirect the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.010 
to determine on how I redirect the
firearm<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.940> if<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.149> gun<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.450> placed<00:00:43.600> Center

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
firearm so if the gun is placed Center

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.110 
firearm so if the gun is placed Center
on<00:00:44.170> me<00:00:44.370> obviously<00:00:45.370> in<00:00:45.460> Krav<00:00:45.640> Maga<00:00:45.730> we<00:00:45.910> want<00:00:46.059> to

on me obviously in Krav Maga we want to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
on me obviously in Krav Maga we want to
take<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.300> off<00:00:46.360> our<00:00:46.510> body<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> shortest

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
take it off our body the shortest

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.689 
take it off our body the shortest
distance<00:00:47.289> with<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.829> least<00:00:48.100> detectable

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
distance with the least detectable

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.729 
distance with the least detectable
movement<00:00:48.870> problem<00:00:49.870> here<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.170> my<00:00:50.379> hands

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
movement problem here is that my hands

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.049 
movement problem here is that my hands
are<00:00:50.829> generally<00:00:51.430> probably<00:00:51.579> gonna<00:00:51.789> be<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:51.969> the

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
are generally probably gonna be on the

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.639 
are generally probably gonna be on the
steering<00:00:52.300> wheel<00:00:52.390> or<00:00:52.690> on<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.899> shifter<00:00:53.289> or

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
steering wheel or on the shifter or

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.889 
steering wheel or on the shifter or
somewhere<00:00:54.039> forward<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.969> weapon<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:55.660> any

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
somewhere forward of the weapon so any

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.869 
somewhere forward of the weapon so any
movement<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.379> make<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.920> redirect<00:00:57.309> in<00:00:57.520> this<00:00:57.670> case

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
movement I make to redirect in this case

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.049 
movement I make to redirect in this case
is<00:00:58.149> either<00:00:58.570> going<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.809> be<00:00:58.930> this<00:00:59.140> way<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.640> this

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
is either going to be this way or this

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.020 
is either going to be this way or this
way<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.620> my<00:01:02.800> hands<00:01:03.039> are<00:01:03.129> that<00:01:03.250> far<00:01:03.399> forward<00:01:03.789> if

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
way if my hands are that far forward if

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
way if my hands are that far forward if
I<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.420> negotiate<00:01:04.660> my<00:01:05.080> hands<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:06.040> come<00:01:06.220> around

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
I can negotiate my hands to come around

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.030 
I can negotiate my hands to come around
the<00:01:06.670> gun<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.960> have<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.170> option<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.800> redirect

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
the gun then I have a option to redirect

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.740 
the gun then I have a option to redirect
on<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.340> other<00:01:09.460> fashion<00:01:09.910> especially<00:01:10.570> if<00:01:10.660> I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
on the other fashion especially if I

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.270 
on the other fashion especially if I
have<00:01:10.840> people<00:01:11.080> in<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> back<00:01:11.350> seat<00:01:11.710> this<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.130> a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
have people in the back seat this is a

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.920 
have people in the back seat this is a
better<00:01:12.490> option<00:01:12.700> for<00:01:12.880> me<00:01:13.000> but<00:01:13.210> also<00:01:13.420> depends<00:01:13.840> on

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
better option for me but also depends on

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.390 
better option for me but also depends on
where<00:01:14.050> my<00:01:14.140> hands<00:01:14.440> are<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:14.980> may<00:01:15.160> need<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.370> use

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
where my hands are so I may need to use

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.760 
where my hands are so I may need to use
some<00:01:15.610> verbal<00:01:15.880> de-escalation<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:17.410> buy<00:01:17.560> myself

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
some verbal de-escalation to buy myself

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.380 
some verbal de-escalation to buy myself
some<00:01:18.130> time<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.730> get<00:01:18.850> into<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.120> better<00:01:19.270> position

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
some time to get into a better position

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.930 
some time to get into a better position
but<00:01:20.260> otherwise<00:01:20.470> if<00:01:20.770> I'm<00:01:20.890> forced<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.370> then

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
but otherwise if I'm forced to then

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.330 
but otherwise if I'm forced to then
maybe<00:01:22.180> I'm<00:01:22.300> redirecting<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.960> gun<00:01:23.110> upward<00:01:23.620> if

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
maybe I'm redirecting the gun upward if

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.490 
maybe I'm redirecting the gun upward if
I<00:01:24.460> have<00:01:24.580> people<00:01:24.850> in<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.000> back<00:01:25.030> seat<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:25.690> it's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
I have people in the back seat so it's

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.840 
I have people in the back seat so it's
about<00:01:26.650> three<00:01:27.040> different<00:01:27.160> directions<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.760> we

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
about three different directions that we

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.490 
about three different directions that we
could<00:01:28.030> go<00:01:28.180> we<00:01:28.690> want<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.900> do<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.110> best<00:01:29.230> one<00:01:29.470> for

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
could go we want to do the best one for

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.080 
could go we want to do the best one for
the<00:01:29.740> scenarios<00:01:30.190> we<00:01:30.340> got<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.580> train<00:01:30.760> on<00:01:30.850> all<00:01:31.000> of

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
the scenarios we got to train on all of

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.790 
the scenarios we got to train on all of
them<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:31.480> if<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.020> guns<00:01:32.170> pointed<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.620> me

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
them so if the guns pointed on me

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.680 
them so if the guns pointed on me
straight<00:01:33.100> not<00:01:33.670> all<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.910> time'<00:01:34.120> by<00:01:34.330> defending
