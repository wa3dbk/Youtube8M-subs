00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
the people are playing so we made spare

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.960 
the people are playing so we made spare

a<00:01:37.030> co-op<00:01:37.329> focused<00:01:37.720> game<00:01:37.930> so<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.530> can't<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
a co-op focused game so you can't the

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.260 
a co-op focused game so you can't the
idea<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.250> putting<00:01:39.430> these<00:01:39.610> machines<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.180> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
idea of putting these machines in the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.789 
idea of putting these machines in the
world<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.780> would<00:01:41.020> give<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.350> something<00:01:41.710> in

world that would give you something in

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.620 
world that would give you something in
single<00:01:42.159> player<00:01:42.189> you'd<00:01:42.640> really<00:01:43.030> need<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.210> second

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
single player you'd really need a second

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.999 
single player you'd really need a second
player<00:01:43.810> there<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.170> experience<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.710> full

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
player there to experience the full

player there to experience the full
potential<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.520> them<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.150> some<00:01:46.329> you<00:01:46.479> can

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
potential of them so some you can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.210 
potential of them so some you can
interact<00:01:46.930> with<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.380> get<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.799> couple<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.070> coins
