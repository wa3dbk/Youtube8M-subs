fluttered so we need to cook this keep
an<00:02:25.940> eye<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.260> click<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.740> high-speed

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
an eye on it so click on the high-speed

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.480 
an eye on it so click on the high-speed
and<00:02:28.490> straight<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.630> way<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.830> toss<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.340> this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
and straight this way just toss it this

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.449 
and straight this way just toss it this
way

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.780 

so<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.439> why<00:02:37.439> I<00:02:37.469> have<00:02:37.890> kept<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.189> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> hyphy

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
so then why I have kept it in the hyphy

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.390 
so then why I have kept it in the hyphy
so<00:02:39.359> that<00:02:39.569> all<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> moisture<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:41.280> know

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so that all the moisture get you know

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.420 
so that all the moisture get you know
get<00:02:42.030> evaporated<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.840> our<00:02:43.500> Vin<00:02:43.829> Diesel<00:02:44.159> coupe

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
get evaporated and our Vin Diesel coupe

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.380 
get evaporated and our Vin Diesel coupe
curl<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.209> will<00:02:45.450> get<00:02:45.780> too<00:02:45.989> clear<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.150> takes

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
curl it will get too clear so it takes

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.630 
curl it will get too clear so it takes
around<00:02:48.569> 10<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.140> 15<00:02:49.500> minutes<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.069> get<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.430> like

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
around 10 to 15 minutes to get it like

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.369 
around 10 to 15 minutes to get it like
crispier<00:02:51.180> look<00:02:51.569> at<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:51.840> color<00:02:52.079> over<00:02:52.349> here

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
crispier look at the color over here

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.160 
crispier look at the color over here
surrounded<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:54.180> really<00:02:54.450> getting<00:02:54.569> crispier

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
surrounded it's really getting crispier

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.629 
surrounded it's really getting crispier
so<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.269> boy<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.599> don't<00:02:57.810> add

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
so and make it a boy and don't add

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.720 
so and make it a boy and don't add
onions<00:02:59.639> or<00:02:59.909> any<00:03:00.209> salt<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.349> before<00:03:01.730> getting

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
onions or any salt in it before getting

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.360 
onions or any salt in it before getting
this<00:03:02.879> coat<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.389> if<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.900> put<00:03:04.409> salt<00:03:04.739> it

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
this coat because if you put salt it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
this coat because if you put salt it
will<00:03:05.609> again<00:03:05.849> boost<00:03:06.150> moisture<00:03:06.599> we<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:06.959> want

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
will again boost moisture we don't want

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.899 
will again boost moisture we don't want
we've<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:07.650> worn<00:03:08.010> all<00:03:08.189> the<00:03:08.370> moisture<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.819> get

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
we've all worn all the moisture to get

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.599 
we've all worn all the moisture to get
absorb<00:03:09.359> so<00:03:10.459> there's<00:03:11.459> this<00:03:11.669> way<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.189> look
