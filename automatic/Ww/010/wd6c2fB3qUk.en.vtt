00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.729 

right<00:00:45.680> around<00:00:46.680> slow<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> medium<00:00:47.760> speed<00:00:48.739> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
right around slow to medium speed and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.630 
right around slow to medium speed and
come<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.070> angle<00:00:51.680> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> least<00:00:53.039> 45

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
come an angle going to be least 45

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
come an angle going to be least 45
degree<00:00:53.969> angles<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> could<00:00:55.289> come<00:00:55.410> closer

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
degree angles or you could come closer

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
degree angles or you could come closer
like<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.250> close<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.850> keep<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
like really close so you can keep it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.180 
like really close so you can keep it
straight<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> never<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.070> because

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
straight but I never do that way because

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.270 
straight but I never do that way because
I<00:00:59.309> always<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.579> hurt<00:01:00.649> when<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> come<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:01.980> angle

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
I always get hurt when it come an angle

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
I always get hurt when it come an angle
at<00:01:02.370> 45<00:01:02.789> degrees<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:03.930> time<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> actually

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
at 45 degrees you have time to actually

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.789 
at 45 degrees you have time to actually
bunny<00:01:05.010> hop<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.400> people<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.770> one

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it all straight it's me really hard

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
it all straight it's me really hard
because<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> keep<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.140> balance

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
because you got to keep all the balance

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
because you got to keep all the balance
in<00:01:20.689> 11<00:01:21.689> tire<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.820> doing<00:01:24.030> ankle

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
in 11 tire so what are you doing ankle

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.830 
in 11 tire so what are you doing ankle
you<00:01:24.420> call<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.799> straight

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
you call like this when you go straight

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.710 
you call like this when you go straight
you<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.939> start<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.570> its

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you actually start from here and its

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.789 
you actually start from here and its
really<00:01:30.869> dangerous<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> could<00:01:31.710> just

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really dangerous because you could just

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.500 
really dangerous because you could just
slip<00:01:32.070> off

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.570 

so<00:01:38.510> when<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.720> come<00:01:38.900> right<00:01:38.990> here<00:01:39.490> you're<00:01:40.490> going

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
so when you come right here you're going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.520 
so when you come right here you're going
to<00:01:40.640> be<00:01:40.760> going<00:01:40.880> as<00:01:41.150> slow<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.870> me<00:01:41.990> mystique<00:01:42.380> of

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
to be going as slow to me mystique of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.840 
to be going as slow to me mystique of
the<00:01:42.590> grinder<00:01:43.010> will<00:01:43.130> actually<00:01:43.430> slow<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.670> down

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
the grinder will actually slow you down

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.630 
the grinder will actually slow you down
and<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.110> hardest<00:01:45.410> part<00:01:45.560> will<00:01:46.280> be<00:01:46.340> actually

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
and the hardest part will be actually

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.820 
and the hardest part will be actually
jumping<00:01:47.390> off<00:01:47.570> more<00:01:47.930> like<00:01:48.080> sliding<00:01:48.440> off<00:01:48.650> from

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
jumping off more like sliding off from

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.380 
jumping off more like sliding off from
the<00:01:48.980> people<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.850> had<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> lot<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.840> trouble<00:01:51.260> feebly

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
the people I had a lot of trouble feebly

the people I had a lot of trouble feebly
from<00:01:53.390> flight<00:01:53.660> for<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.870> first<00:01:54.110> couple<00:01:54.230> weeks

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
from flight for the first couple weeks

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.790 
from flight for the first couple weeks
because<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.860> never<00:01:54.920> got<00:01:55.250> down<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.670> odd<00:01:56.800> exiting

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
because I never got down to odd exiting

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.710 
because I never got down to odd exiting
part<00:01:58.070> which<00:01:58.640> jumping<00:01:59.090> off<00:01:59.240> for<00:01:59.390> flying<00:01:59.630> off<00:02:01.720> so

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
part which jumping off for flying off so

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.400 
part which jumping off for flying off so
just<00:02:02.870> keep<00:02:03.050> practicing<00:02:03.490> jumping<00:02:04.490> off<00:02:04.820> Oh

just keep practicing jumping off Oh
bunny<00:02:06.410> hopping<00:02:06.650> or<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.070> can<00:02:07.220> slide<00:02:07.430> off

bunny hopping or you can slide off
sliding<00:02:08.780> off<00:02:09.020> all<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.350> gotta<00:02:09.530> do<00:02:09.710> is<00:02:09.740> will<00:02:10.700> be

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
sliding off all you gotta do is will be

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.690 
sliding off all you gotta do is will be
tired<00:02:11.090> little<00:02:11.390> bit<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.920> will<00:02:13.010> put<00:02:13.610> you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
tired little bit and it will put you

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.990 
tired little bit and it will put you
down<00:02:14.020> twenty<00:02:15.020> hopping<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> lot<00:02:15.650> harder

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
down twenty hopping is a lot harder

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.970 
down twenty hopping is a lot harder
because<00:02:17.000> he<00:02:17.240> actually<00:02:17.360> gonna<00:02:17.660> jump<00:02:18.590> off<00:02:18.740> go

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
because he actually gonna jump off go

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.030 
because he actually gonna jump off go
over<00:02:19.160> your<00:02:19.280> own<00:02:19.400> tires<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.050> sometimes<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
hopping begin to like this and you're

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.440 
hopping begin to like this and you're
going<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.990> pitch<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:34.090> your<00:02:35.090> backpack

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.980 

like<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.410> 45<00:02:50.340> degree<00:02:50.580> angle<00:02:50.910> all<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.840> got<00:02:51.960> to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
like this 45 degree angle all you got to
