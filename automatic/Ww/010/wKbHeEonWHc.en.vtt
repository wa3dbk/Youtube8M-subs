of<00:02:56.220> when<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> go<00:02:56.520> over<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.450> know<00:02:57.480> bumps<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
of when I go over you know bumps and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.900 
of when I go over you know bumps and
stuff<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:58.350> make<00:02:58.470> too<00:02:58.860> quick<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> Acharya<00:02:59.580> kinda

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
stuff or make too quick of Acharya kinda

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.760 
stuff or make too quick of Acharya kinda
I<00:03:00.090> think<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> yourself<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.260> squeaking<00:03:01.590> I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
I think I can yourself is squeaking I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460 
I think I can yourself is squeaking I
think<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.640> back<00:03:03.090> glass<00:03:03.390> here<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:04.290> I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
think it's just the back glass here if I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
think it's just the back glass here if I
actually<00:03:04.620> was<00:03:04.860> on<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.010> else<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.220> think<00:03:05.310> it's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
actually was on the else I think it's

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.000 
actually was on the else I think it's
just<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.670> little<00:03:05.760> off<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.300> think<00:03:06.480> I'm<00:03:06.570> gonna<00:03:06.690> try

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
just a little off I think I'm gonna try

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.780 
just a little off I think I'm gonna try
unscrewing<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.190> whole<00:03:08.310> thing<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.640> putting

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
unscrewing the whole thing and putting

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.820 
unscrewing the whole thing and putting
it<00:03:08.910> back<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.570> may<00:03:10.440> hope<00:03:10.560> at<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.740> only

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
it back on I may hope at the only

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.430 
it back on I may hope at the only
problem<00:03:11.160> or<00:03:11.250> maybe<00:03:11.460> it's<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.180> off<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.960> teeny

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
problem or maybe it's just off a teeny

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.320 
problem or maybe it's just off a teeny
little<00:03:13.530> bit<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.100> maybe<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.460> UH<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.820> mean<00:03:15.210> it's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
little bit like maybe the UH I mean it's

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330 
little bit like maybe the UH I mean it's
on<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:15.630> I've<00:03:15.780> already<00:03:15.930> driven<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.440> many

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
on here I've already driven it many

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.790 
on here I've already driven it many
miles<00:03:17.610> highway<00:03:18.060> driving<00:03:18.380> sharp<00:03:19.380> turns<00:03:19.650> you

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
miles highway driving sharp turns you

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080 
miles highway driving sharp turns you
know<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.280> not<00:03:20.370> coming<00:03:20.580> off<00:03:20.790> its

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
know it's not it's not coming off its

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.090 
know it's not it's not coming off its
but<00:03:22.050> which<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.290> think<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.739> great<00:03:22.950> idea

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
but which I think this is a great idea

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.699 
but which I think this is a great idea
here<00:03:23.550> these<00:03:23.730> uh<00:03:24.020> just<00:03:25.020> in<00:03:25.110> case<00:03:25.140> someone<00:03:25.680> else

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
here these uh just in case someone else

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.620 
here these uh just in case someone else
doesn't<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> hardtop<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.880> think<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.570> a

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
doesn't have a hardtop I think this is a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.510 
doesn't have a hardtop I think this is a
great<00:03:27.810> idea<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.140> soft-top<00:03:28.470> ones<00:03:28.860> just<00:03:29.310> kind

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
great idea the soft-top ones just kind

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
great idea the soft-top ones just kind
of<00:03:29.550> latch<00:03:29.760> right<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.120> they're<00:03:30.270> kind<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.420> hard

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
of latch right in they're kind of hard

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.810 
of latch right in they're kind of hard
to<00:03:30.600> get<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:30.959> these<00:03:31.140> which<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.310> can't<00:03:32.700> even

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
to get in but these which I can't even

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.510 
to get in but these which I can't even
get<00:03:33.000> off<00:03:33.030> right<00:03:33.360> now<00:03:33.830> there<00:03:34.830> we<00:03:34.920> go<00:03:35.100> it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
get off right now there we go it

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.060 
get off right now there we go it
actually<00:03:35.910> has<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.380> here<00:03:37.650> this

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
actually has a you can see here this

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.310 
actually has a you can see here this
actually<00:03:38.640> screws<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.330> twist<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:39.989> it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
actually screws like you twist it and it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.150 
actually screws like you twist it and it
screws<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.920> match<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.519> right<00:03:42.739> height<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.950> guess

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
screws to match the right height I guess

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.490 
screws to match the right height I guess
you<00:03:44.310> could<00:03:44.430> say<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.730> hall<00:03:44.850> right<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.500> level

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
you could say the hall right a level

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.540 
you could say the hall right a level
like<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.800> was<00:03:46.890> too<00:03:47.010> high<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.250> could<00:03:47.400> screw

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
like if it was too high you could screw

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.850 
like if it was too high you could screw
it<00:03:47.640> down<00:03:48.330> too<00:03:48.780> low<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.019> could<00:03:49.230> screw<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
it down too low you could screw it up I

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.940 
it down too low you could screw it up I
think<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.519> great<00:03:50.670> idea<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.800> then<00:03:52.800> these

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
think it's a great idea and then these

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.430 
think it's a great idea and then these
just<00:03:53.880> Bolton<00:03:54.630> here<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.810> got<00:03:54.930> three<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.320> this

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.700 
this one over here is it paint it's
right<00:04:19.919> behind<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.570> roll<00:04:21.570> bar<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.410> can't<00:04:22.590> even

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
right behind the roll bar you can't even

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.540 
right behind the roll bar you can't even
get<00:04:22.800> your<00:04:22.860> hand<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.190> or<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.310> think<00:04:23.460> it's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
get your hand it or I think it's

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.460 
get your hand it or I think it's
actually<00:04:23.640> little<00:04:23.940> rusted<00:04:24.300> when<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.479> take<00:04:25.320> this

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
actually little rusted when I take this

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.330 
actually little rusted when I take this
off<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.800> got<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.010> make

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
off I got to make

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.310 
off I got to make
for<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:26.910> when<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.060> take<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.360> off<00:04:27.510> I'm<00:04:28.110> gonna

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
for it but when I take it off I'm gonna

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.530 
for it but when I take it off I'm gonna
the<00:04:28.950> whole<00:04:29.040> -<00:04:29.310> needs<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.669> painted<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
the whole - needs to be painted it's a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.210 
the whole - needs to be painted it's a
funny<00:04:30.720> story<00:04:30.990> about<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.770> think<00:04:32.130> this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
funny story about that but I think this

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.379 
funny story about that but I think this
might<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> little<00:04:32.550> rust<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:32.970> try<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.150> find

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
might be a little rust and try to find

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.570 
might be a little rust and try to find
maybe<00:04:33.600> I'm<00:04:34.050> sure<00:04:34.380> oh<00:04:34.680> well<00:04:35.100> I'm<00:04:35.160> not<00:04:35.280> sure<00:04:35.550> that

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
maybe I'm sure oh well I'm not sure that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.550 
maybe I'm sure oh well I'm not sure that
they<00:04:35.850> actually<00:04:36.150> sell<00:04:36.500> replacements<00:04:37.500> for

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
they actually sell replacements for

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.780 
they actually sell replacements for
these<00:04:37.680> but<00:04:37.800> I'm<00:04:37.860> sure<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.040> can<00:04:38.250> find<00:04:38.520> a

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
these but I'm sure I can find a

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.490 
these but I'm sure I can find a
replacement<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.780> fit<00:04:40.020> all<00:04:40.110> them<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.440> this

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
replacement to fit all them and this

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.680 
replacement to fit all them and this
comeback<00:04:40.800> he<00:04:40.919> already<00:04:41.040> fits<00:04:41.280> fine<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.690> it's

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
comeback he already fits fine and it's

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.940 
comeback he already fits fine and it's
it's<00:04:42.900> not<00:04:43.020> like<00:04:43.169> it's<00:04:43.290> coming<00:04:43.530> off<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.800> oh<00:04:43.830> I

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
it's not like it's coming off I oh I

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.350 
it's not like it's coming off I oh I
actually<00:04:44.250> have<00:04:44.400> no<00:04:44.520> worries<00:04:44.730> about<00:04:44.850> that<00:04:45.000> just

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
actually have no worries about that just

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.330 
actually have no worries about that just
a<00:04:45.450> squeak<00:04:45.750> ol<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.470> gets<00:04:46.710> to<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.950> after<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.220> while

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
a squeak ol it gets to you after a while

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.090 
a squeak ol it gets to you after a while

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
looking for one for a very long time and

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.550 
looking for one for a very long time and
then<00:05:00.150> this<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.450> just<00:05:00.630> presented<00:05:00.990> itself<00:05:01.260> was

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
then this one just presented itself was

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.659 
then this one just presented itself was
good<00:05:02.490> price<00:05:02.820> close<00:05:03.360> it<00:05:04.320> was<00:05:04.500> great<00:05:04.830> that's<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
good price close it was great that's the

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:06.710 
good price close it was great that's the
kind<00:05:05.910> of<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.030> tripping<00:05:06.300> I'm<00:05:06.419> talking<00:05:06.690> about

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
kind of the tripping I'm talking about

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.120 
kind of the tripping I'm talking about
kind<00:05:06.990> of<00:05:07.020> near<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.169> edge<00:05:07.350> here<00:05:07.530> sorta<00:05:07.889> you<00:05:08.010> can

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
kind of near the edge here sorta you can

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.260 
kind of near the edge here sorta you can
see<00:05:08.340> kind<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:10.250> chipping<00:05:11.250> away<00:05:11.340> now<00:05:12.240> I

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
see kind of like chipping away now I

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.750 
see kind of like chipping away now I
know<00:05:12.389> often<00:05:12.930> like<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.979> guys<00:05:14.160> start<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.580> get<00:05:14.729> a

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
know often like the guys start to get a

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.110 
know often like the guys start to get a
cracks<00:05:15.479> in<00:05:15.690> these<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.290> one<00:05:17.280> crack<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.970> just

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
cracks in these and one crack can just

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.430 
cracks in these and one crack can just
lead<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.479> bigger<00:05:18.660> crack<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.110> better<00:05:19.229> crack

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
lead to a bigger crack and better crack

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.080 
lead to a bigger crack and better crack
but<00:05:19.620> that's<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.979> think<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.490> usually<00:05:20.790> happens

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
but that's I think that usually happens

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.700 
but that's I think that usually happens
to<00:05:21.120> guys<00:05:21.270> who<00:05:21.450> go<00:05:21.600> off-road<00:05:22.020> with<00:05:22.050> hard<00:05:22.350> tops<00:05:22.560> I

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
to guys who go off-road with hard tops I

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.140 
to guys who go off-road with hard tops I
notice<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:22.979> lot<00:05:23.070> of<00:05:23.100> guys<00:05:23.220> who<00:05:23.490> do<00:05:23.639> go<00:05:23.790> off-road

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
notice a lot of guys who do go off-road

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.659 
notice a lot of guys who do go off-road
usually<00:05:24.810> have<00:05:24.930> soft<00:05:25.290> tops<00:05:25.590> on<00:05:25.830> because

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
usually have soft tops on because

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:27.770 
usually have soft tops on because
there's<00:05:26.820> no<00:05:26.940> chance<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.270> happening<00:05:27.360> but

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
there's no chance of that happening but

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.659 
there's no chance of that happening but
I<00:05:27.810> think<00:05:28.080> this<00:05:28.200> happens<00:05:28.500> if<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.770> do<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.400> lot<00:05:29.639> of

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
I think this happens if you do a lot of

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.850 
I think this happens if you do a lot of
heavy<00:05:30.120> off-roading<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.050> think<00:05:31.560> that's<00:05:31.680> how<00:05:31.830> a

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
heavy off-roading I think that's how a

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.040 
heavy off-roading I think that's how a
lot<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.280> hard<00:05:32.430> tops<00:05:32.640> end<00:05:32.850> up<00:05:32.940> cracking<00:05:33.390> but<00:05:34.020> I

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
lot of hard tops end up cracking but I

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.080 
lot of hard tops end up cracking but I
don't<00:05:34.350> go<00:05:34.470> off-road<00:05:34.890> probably<00:05:35.729> not<00:05:35.850> with<00:05:35.940> this

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
don't go off-road probably not with this

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.700 
don't go off-road probably not with this
cheap<00:05:36.300> ever<00:05:36.479> maybe<00:05:36.690> some<00:05:36.960> day<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.140> be<00:05:37.289> nice<00:05:37.440> but

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
cheap ever maybe some day to be nice but

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.260 
cheap ever maybe some day to be nice but
probably<00:05:38.490> not<00:05:38.610> with<00:05:38.729> this<00:05:38.850> one<00:05:39.000> this<00:05:39.060> one<00:05:39.240> is

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
probably not with this one this one is

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
what I mean and I don't I mean I'm not

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.710 
what I mean and I don't I mean I'm not
complaining<00:06:07.410> I'm<00:06:07.800> still<00:06:08.310> beyond<00:06:09.180> happy<00:06:09.600> with

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
complaining I'm still beyond happy with

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.129 
complaining I'm still beyond happy with
this<00:06:09.810> I'm<00:06:10.050> thrilled<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:12.570> funny<00:06:12.750> thing<00:06:12.840> is

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
this I'm thrilled but the funny thing is

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.350 
this I'm thrilled but the funny thing is
my<00:06:13.800> fenders<00:06:14.160> are<00:06:14.280> faded<00:06:14.669> and<00:06:14.820> the<00:06:15.120> top<00:06:15.330> is

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
my fenders are faded and the top is

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.570 
my fenders are faded and the top is
faded<00:06:15.870> so<00:06:16.320> it<00:06:16.440> actually<00:06:16.800> kind<00:06:16.979> of<00:06:17.039> matches<00:06:17.430> if

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
faded so it actually kind of matches if

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.760 
faded so it actually kind of matches if
you<00:06:17.669> get<00:06:17.789> a<00:06:17.820> good<00:06:17.940> perspective<00:06:18.150> at<00:06:18.630> it<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:19.710> I

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
you get a good perspective at it it I

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.110 
you get a good perspective at it it I
think<00:06:20.220> it's<00:06:20.310> actually<00:06:20.400> kind<00:06:20.700> of<00:06:20.729> funny<00:06:20.940> that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
think it's actually kind of funny that

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.400 
think it's actually kind of funny that
way<00:06:21.210> normally<00:06:21.810> if<00:06:21.870> this<00:06:21.960> was<00:06:22.080> like<00:06:22.169> really

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
way normally if this was like really

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.570 
way normally if this was like really
black<00:06:22.620> that<00:06:22.800> make<00:06:22.919> the<00:06:23.010> fenders<00:06:23.280> look<00:06:23.400> better

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
black that make the fenders look better

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.680 
black that make the fenders look better
the<00:06:23.760> funders<00:06:24.060> were<00:06:24.150> good<00:06:24.270> would<00:06:24.419> make<00:06:24.539> this

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
the funders were good would make this

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.480 
the funders were good would make this
look<00:06:24.870> bad<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.650> they're<00:06:25.800> actually<00:06:25.950> faded<00:06:26.400> to

of<00:07:06.810> see<00:07:06.960> where<00:07:07.110> it's<00:07:07.200> kind<00:07:07.410> of<00:07:07.560> maybe<00:07:08.280> just

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
of see where it's kind of maybe just

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.920 
of see where it's kind of maybe just
starting<00:07:08.940> but<00:07:09.090> I<00:07:09.150> think<00:07:09.420> I<00:07:09.540> think<00:07:09.720> I<00:07:09.780> could

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
starting but I think I think I could

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.360 
starting but I think I think I could
find<00:07:10.140> somebody<00:07:10.320> maybe<00:07:10.530> sand<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:10.980> down<00:07:11.160> and

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
find somebody maybe sand that down and

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.740 
find somebody maybe sand that down and
putty<00:07:11.610> that<00:07:11.700> up<00:07:11.970> and<00:07:12.150> I<00:07:12.180> think<00:07:12.240> it'll<00:07:12.480> be<00:07:12.600> good

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
putty that up and I think it'll be good

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.240 
putty that up and I think it'll be good
and<00:07:12.900> then<00:07:12.990> repaint<00:07:13.290> the<00:07:13.410> whole<00:07:13.500> thing<00:07:13.740> just

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
and then repaint the whole thing just

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.560 
and then repaint the whole thing just
absolutely<00:07:14.730> spot<00:07:14.910> but<00:07:15.060> other<00:07:15.180> than<00:07:15.240> that<00:07:15.390> it's

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
absolutely spot but other than that it's

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.810 
absolutely spot but other than that it's
like<00:07:16.170> I<00:07:16.260> said<00:07:16.440> it's<00:07:16.590> in<00:07:16.650> good<00:07:16.800> shape<00:07:16.860> other
