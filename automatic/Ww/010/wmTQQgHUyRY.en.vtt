00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:15.500
 here I have a pound of wheat for the 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:17.689
 team and has the 750 ml of boiling water 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.869
 that I will put within that time 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.180
 to stop being reminded that it is the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.840
 straight amount has no need 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.949
 to choose, then what's the matter, kid? 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.590
 I'll measure if it catches your 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.720
 blender and medium making this 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.690
 video to give an update because the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.550
 my dark path was made in another 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.739
 I'm now looking to do everything here. 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.739
 over my stove also illuminate dinho 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:01:00.500
 It is not 40 minutes to 40 meanwhile 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.660
 You go there and season the meat with meat. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.729
 as I said in the other video in the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.670
 another careful video with garlic care 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.249
 Onion looks for there everything race with which the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.479
 seasoning does not add too much time 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.729
 All you have to do to sell 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.069
 because otherwise it would be an asset or leave 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.020
 rest I'm going to have my flesh and people 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.959
 finished doing ours that gives a 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.649
 Look how you grew up as someone who shows me 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:27.740
 I will not need to donate it. 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.420
 absorb the right amount is you will 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.149
 do the following if you have always been 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.189
 do that not doing here is 6 recipe 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.099
 half a recipe still for you to see how 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.979
 yields you will put 500 grams of 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:42.679
 flour and 500 of meat if it is a kilo 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.709
 of flour will be 1 kilo of my load. 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:49.130
 tempered pen or buy a meat 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:52.009
 has only pear with garlic and 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.169
 onion that I did not even say I want 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.880
 Do you want something more enhanced? 

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:57.950
 You may be closing seasonings for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.079
 sell has to be this here not people 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.270
 and only after the deal says it does not have 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.989
 that to be a neutral sort of thing but the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.509
 garlic, onion and sun to sell their 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.770
 house can put other things like 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.599
 Brazilian friends are small or 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.599
 put a larger bowl to mix 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.580
 these two southern two ingredients up to 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.560
 League already shows for you 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.440
 give a look like that rendered looks 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.550
 also with this clearer video and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 a machine on top most given in brasilia 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.410
 you can have a sense of how I 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.989
 I put my seasoning to taste demand 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.209
 try the amount of salt because 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.239
 at the time you stayed fried stay 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.130
 subject then seasons experimenting 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.290
 to see if you are happy and 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.090
 well tempered here now it does not have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.630
 secret point this here 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.260
 is so perfect as it gives the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.530
 right point o donut hand so did 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.320
 ball this is the point of your team 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.239
 You'll roll if it's a ball. 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.100
 look for peta people because if you 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.750
 squeeze will burst 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.580
 I found that footprint anyway 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.190
 place 5 laziness 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.340
 she is going to burst does not make a ball well 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.750
 tight right 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.780
 a ball that you make the ball by squeezing 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.709
 of course asking you are going to do the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:29.010
 format of your quibe pointed here not 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:33.959
 I had to keep forgetting to tighten it. 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:38.570
 finished give a little squeeze and one last 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:42.660
 time I saw that face ae 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.519
 in the last round right there comes puts 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.400
 here you do not need to pass anything abruptly 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.130
 has hot oil not so hot and 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.700
 cold or very hot story fried by 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 outside and gets raw inside has to be the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.269
 oil hot enough for you to stay 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.850
 quietly without burning out and 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.709
 getting raw inside was rolling my 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.370
 There's no secret here if you're going to do it. 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.720
 To party, you're going to make it smaller. 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.710
 sure what it will do less 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.049
 and that way the terminal and you can 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.140
 it is also that you stuff your with catupiry 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.220
 you can close concelho with 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.950
 cheese type whatever what ever your taste 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.190
 Make it clear that if it's for you 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.510
 sold a little more expensive but you 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.920
 may be putting there what you 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.770
 I want to stuff 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.330
 Do you think it suits me if I go? 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.070
 finish running my 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.450
 and we 're going to make some 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.760
 you see how it is 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.590
 here also what happens to that 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.320
 The one I made, I played one. 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:53.950
 to take a test if it was 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.950
 good in my eye with a peek 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.290
 Coladinho has to pass in flour of 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.920
 thread without hearing anything, just put 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.810
 stay 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.710
 I try to make it a bowl with 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.630
 Background quite large and thick possible 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.000
 eye can not be too hot rate 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:19.100
 will not burst like put accept 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.430
 slowly close it so it will not open and 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:28.400
 not as hot as I said no 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:32.690
 neymar on the outside and 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:37.100
 inside it's raw is a little more 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:39.290
 hot time he's gay and he to 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.320
 record so sustained well then I go 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.330
 to give a fluffy in the lowered corner 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.880
 let it be too much 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.140
 I'll fry mine here I do not think so. 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.550
 needs thereby avoiding us 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.470
 thus in either claim stage 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.570
 finalization being made is nothing for you 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.340
 see what I do has a control of 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.870
 no one I do myself by the cold 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.380
 So opting for you is giving a 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.150
 look at you 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.550
 I'll try my other kids who are 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.700
 here is not opening to see you either 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.400
 It needs to close well for you. 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.470
 surprise to burst open do that 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.000
 party on your other or fry my 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.310
 I'll show you later a photo shows 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.110
 for you to be discussed here is ours 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.100
 club I zoomed in for you to see 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.740
 many different 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.630
 this is the fried fried that those who 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.790
 Are you watching fry and 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.300
 from here, the more I 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.280
 I went out and left 40 minutes in the 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.130
 oven 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.600
 so if you want this quibe people 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.250
 otter smokeless 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.910
 this balance is simple for you 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.330
 sell it to get money in your 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.100
 showtec anyway just so in others 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.590
 dating ingredients you can 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.850
 put other things you can 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.180
 to be implementing 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.160
 This is a very simple team, very easy but 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.980
 there are those that you can fool yourself 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.880
 You just want it in the flour and 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.820
 fried or do as I did only legal 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.010
 You tell him to close some more. 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.140
 At the time you stay there, the 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.800
 He does not know the difference is if he goes. 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.720
 to have her know the difference is fine 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.150
 closed and the fried it is already 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.860
 different it does not look the same 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.630
 so you may be paying him with a 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.760
 egg and flour of taste 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.590
 Dildo until golden 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.180
 I'm as high as I said to not be 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.940
 very burned and the impression that 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.800
 is fried roast step the group d 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.240
 this is my club is another club that already 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.220
 had done only with a little picture 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.950
 lighter the zoom 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.720
 Are you seeing more or less better? 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.290
 I hope you have enjoyed selling it 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.290
 enough
