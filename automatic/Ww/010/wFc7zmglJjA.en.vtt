00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.309
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.250
 another gta 5 let's play on this 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.019
 welti and that with the ideos can probably 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 not somehow important things to do na 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.010
 yes, no matter now state is easy 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 alone here in the game ryan the lade 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 screen is running 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 somehow they also saw each other 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.710
 cool, well, we're here for the brender 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 the Turks are now also the turks 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.599
 I would say that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.850
 Let's just take a look 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.309
 but somehow sympathetic from lausanne 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 tas from above but somehow different 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.530
 no matter we are just in here now 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.170
 apartment and what are we doing now? 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 best the lamp is gone again 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:01:03.180
 That really can not be 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:01:05.430
 the profession then we'll take everything 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.970
 Clear a new mission drive-by the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.380
 let's do it I'll press x iks here 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.750
 and we can do the crew here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.790
 select their brother turks burners 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.830
 does the brother have it yet 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 here quite well arranged the takers 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 We can choose a weapon 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.869
 she does not look that bad 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.009
 From vehicles eighth races scarce 8 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.850
 I'll take it I'll be there 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.320
 curious what comes out there and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.090
 but they are also getting more and more 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 Expense here at the loading screens like that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.770
 you're gonna dream something of dead age 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.210
 continue jo at the moment that with the weapons 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.049
 and with the vehicle I was me 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.640
 somehow a little bit different 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.020
 what do we have here i have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.549
 can not really be right 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.390
 I have what should I do here now 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.880
 I'm totally crazy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.979
 overtaxed and hour is the mission 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.909
 passing damn that I had changed my mind 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.830
 presented 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.940
 there the three were probably better equipped 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.409
 I do not have any more now either 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.550
 Stand on the letter will say 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.619
 try another character 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.869
 let's go over to the brender 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.890
 nelly because she does not prefer we take 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.930
 here the turks 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.930
 let's see what's going on in the ok so 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.420
 I'm looking for a different one yes that's okay now 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.860
 a bit too much interactivity then 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.299
 I'll go for better or worse 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.190
 over to the brender 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.260
 that was kinda a bit to me now 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.239
 to integrated times look what's here 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.940
 lack the brender strolling a 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.500
 a bit through the streets are 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.790
 somehow the keys interchanged with that 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.180
 I had the control somehow 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 presented differently moment that's 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.010
 here I expect war already 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.540
 Somehow it was 8 now 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.950
 not planned women are somehow 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.750
 always a bit hard to handle 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.850
 she was a bit masculine somehow 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.850
 yes our brender let's see what the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.900
 Of course that's the way it goes 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.910
 now do not see a pity weapons without 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.500
 nail file also typical woman with it can 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.760
 Of course you do not start much now 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.439
 Let's go into the arms shop 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.090
 there are certainly better things to do 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.650
 buy so we'll see what the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.310
 colleague for us has press to 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.470
 act 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.840
 we do yes or not only 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.230
 fucking product placement the magnum 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.790
 we can out 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.769
 you have not enough lbbw there is 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.519
 no blowjob button here then that must 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.159
 but work out 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.049
 Left Right fix everything works here 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.299
 where is the blue pot button that 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.629
 is somehow moment who we are 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.889
 because now how much money do we have 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.659
 is that for equipment here 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.720
 over the swak cannon is with the start 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.420
 I like that even better here 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.859
 now yes our new character is saying 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.420
 Of course, all would be humble 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.519
 girl weak last mission 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.099
 we should repeat with the character 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.769
 that be feasible 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:06.519
 you're so dead old hasta la 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.959
 vista offers that we want it 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.659
 see the weapon must be the sure 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.099
 Actually , the first act says it works 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.660
 the second and the third 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.000
 that has a lot better 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.720
 worked out successful mission so must 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.030
 to run 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.010
 we hope you have sap in the gti live 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.599
 like a very big thank you 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.520
 to the guys from the bullshit tv and 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.650
 of course an easy Wyplay for 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.570
 let's play and then it goes on 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.479
 either with the prehistory of jack 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:36.210
 white or you can cologne 08 15 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.210
 See which way we see 13 days
