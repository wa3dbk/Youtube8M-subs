00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
in this video tutorial we're going to go

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480 
in this video tutorial we're going to go
over<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:03.179> pencil<00:00:03.720> tool<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.710> pencil<00:00:05.040> tool<00:00:05.250> is

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
over the pencil tool the pencil tool is

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.799 
over the pencil tool the pencil tool is
located<00:00:06.420> under<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.350> pen<00:00:07.830> tool<00:00:08.389> the<00:00:09.389> icon

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
located under the pen tool the icon

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.950 
located under the pen tool the icon
looks<00:00:10.230> very<00:00:10.530> similar<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> pencil<00:00:11.960> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
looks very similar to a pencil the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.540 
looks very similar to a pencil the
shortcut<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.070> N<00:00:14.250> key<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.089> keyboard

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
shortcut is the N key on the keyboard

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.640 
shortcut is the N key on the keyboard
now<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:18.060> like<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.600> pen<00:00:18.840> tool<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
now just like the pen tool there is a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
now just like the pen tool there is a
small<00:00:20.160> black<00:00:20.520> triangle<00:00:21.029> located<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
small black triangle located on the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.220 
small black triangle located on the
bottom<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.529> hand<00:00:22.650> corner<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.279> icon

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
bottom right hand corner of the icon

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
bottom right hand corner of the icon
what<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.350> means<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.130> hold<00:00:26.430> down<00:00:26.519> on

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
what that means is if you hold down on

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.480 
what that means is if you hold down on
the<00:00:27.060> pencil<00:00:27.810> tool<00:00:28.250> you're<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.429> see

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the pencil tool you're going to see

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
the pencil tool you're going to see
another<00:00:29.640> menu<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.060> pops<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:31.080> there<00:00:31.260> are

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
another menu that pops up and there are

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.690 
another menu that pops up and there are
three<00:00:31.859> tools<00:00:32.099> total<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.250> use<00:00:35.489> with

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
three tools total that you can use with

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
three tools total that you can use with
the<00:00:35.820> pencil<00:00:36.090> tool<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the pencil tool so the first one is the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
the pencil tool so the first one is the
pencil<00:00:37.350> tool<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.950> let's<00:00:37.980> make<00:00:38.280> sure<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
pencil tool so let's make sure that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.330 
pencil tool so let's make sure that
one's<00:00:38.730> selected<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:40.320> pencil<00:00:40.620> tool<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.100> very

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
one's selected the pencil tool is very

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
one's selected the pencil tool is very
similar<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.180> pen<00:00:42.420> tool<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.079> line

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
similar to the pen tool and the line

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
similar to the pen tool and the line
tool<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.829> creates<00:00:43.980> lines<00:00:44.460> however

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
tool in that it creates lines however

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
tool in that it creates lines however
instead<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> being<00:00:45.629> restricted<00:00:46.289> by<00:00:46.590> clicking

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
instead of being restricted by clicking

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.369 
instead of being restricted by clicking
with<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.090> pencil<00:00:48.300> tool<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> hold<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
with a pencil tool if you hold down the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319 
with a pencil tool if you hold down the
mouse<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.370> free<00:00:50.760> hand<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
mouse you can actually free hand and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.889 
mouse you can actually free hand and
draw<00:00:52.140> freely<00:00:52.850> any<00:00:53.850> shape<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> can

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
draw freely any shape you want you can

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.799 
draw freely any shape you want you can
make<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.140> wavy<00:00:55.620> anything<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.719> now<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
make it wavy anything like that now the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
make it wavy anything like that now the
problem<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.059> back

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
problem is when you do this you go back

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.750 
problem is when you do this you go back
to<00:01:00.420> V<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.039> line<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.489> look

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to V you can see the line doesn't look

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.830 
to V you can see the line doesn't look
very<00:01:02.789> smooth<00:01:03.860> it's<00:01:04.860> more<00:01:05.100> jaggedy<00:01:05.840> things

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
very smooth it's more jaggedy things

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
very smooth it's more jaggedy things
like<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> whereas<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.220> with

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
like that whereas if you do this with

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.230 
like that whereas if you do this with
the<00:01:08.400> pen<00:01:08.580> tool<00:01:08.790> it'd<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.119> nice<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.689> nice<00:01:10.350> curve

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
the pen tool it'd be nice a nice curve

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.789 
the pen tool it'd be nice a nice curve
and<00:01:12.240> that's<00:01:12.510> where<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> smooth<00:01:13.290> tool<00:01:13.530> comes

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and that's where the smooth tool comes

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.789 
and that's where the smooth tool comes
in<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.909> first<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.560> go

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
in so what we first want to do is to go

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.690 
in so what we first want to do is to go
back<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> select<00:01:18.439> our<00:01:19.439> object<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
back and select our object which is the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.539 
back and select our object which is the
line<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> pencil<00:01:22.380> tool<00:01:22.650> hold<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
line go back to the pencil tool hold it

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.719 
line go back to the pencil tool hold it
down<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> smooth<00:01:24.780> tool<00:01:25.729> now

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
down and go to the smooth tool now

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.950 
down and go to the smooth tool now
you'll<00:01:26.939> notice<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.659> icon<00:01:29.600> not<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> icon

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you'll notice the icon not the icon

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
you'll notice the icon not the icon
excuse<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.400> mouse<00:01:32.640> cursor<00:01:33.020> now<00:01:34.020> has<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
excuse me the mouse cursor now has it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
excuse me the mouse cursor now has it
looks<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.180> chalk<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:37.170> some

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
looks kind of like a chalk with some

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
looks kind of like a chalk with some
squiggly<00:01:37.650> circles<00:01:38.189> around<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.689> you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
squiggly circles around it so what you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.800 
squiggly circles around it so what you
can<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.030> go<00:01:42.030> over<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
can do with this now is go over the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.160 
can do with this now is go over the
object<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> line<00:01:44.090> hold<00:01:45.090> holding<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
object or the line hold holding the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
object or the line hold holding the
mouse<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.579> will

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
mouse and when you do that it will

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.140 
mouse and when you do that it will
smooth<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.570> your<00:01:49.430> pencil<00:01:50.430> strokes

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.550 

if<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:54.840> notice<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.100> anchor<00:01:56.430> points<00:01:57.560> will

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
if you notice the anchor points will

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.520 
if you notice the anchor points will
start<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.310> get<00:02:00.270> less<00:02:00.480> and<00:02:00.540> less<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:01.230> good

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
start to get less and less that's good

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.060 
start to get less and less that's good
because<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> means<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.370> you<00:02:02.550> have<00:02:02.670> less

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
because that means that you have less

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
because that means that you have less
jagged<00:02:05.070> edges<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.780> keep<00:02:06.990> doing
