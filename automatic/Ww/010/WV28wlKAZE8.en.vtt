 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.840
 Hello everyone, I'm with you again and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.440
 today is the third video 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 completing 7 bl dt 67 grass 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.410
 that is why such a secure phone 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.739
 a tank for a real man let's start eating 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.280
 walkie-talkie climbed out and how she 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.520
 works 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.500
 hissing burrs but surely passes 30 or 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.840
 60 seconds of outgoing flow of your words and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.540
 exactly the same takes works like on 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 reception and transmission on purity 446 and 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.750
 446 and one megahertz everything is standard everything 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 very simple there is a lot 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.940
 settings 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.530
 everything can be built by itself walkie-talkie also 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.759
 works in the background well let's actually 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.759
 consider it all 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.650
 As for the flashlight, he is undoubtedly 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.030
 bright bright enough to at 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.240
 white house in the middle of a clear day itself 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.540
 illuminates such a very very visible 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.970
 circle if you go to a completely dark 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.810
 there is absolutely no room 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.770
 lighting 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.770
 You can see, too, such a clear circle all 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 clearly visible again the camera 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.020
 does not transfer much of the world will 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.680
 brighter it all looks in general flashlight 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.800
 fit 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.890
 Well, in the end perhaps the most 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.320
 interesting of the tests take the usual 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.490
 liter jar rented specifically and not with 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.500
 tripod with hands 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.459
 then take the usual liter jar 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.290
 we fill with water everything as there is a phone 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:30.050
 check all the plugs in place everything is deaf 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.560
 In clearly here the phone is included Simka inside 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:40.420
 we have don't know focuses or 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.420
 no, and here it is 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:55.300
 here he is looking inside the bank 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:57.340
 twist here it is currently alive well 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.430
 the most interesting when the phone is inside 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.030
 let's try calling him like 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.030
 it will look 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.980
 by name 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.000
 video priro because you never know 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.760
 god song violates copyright 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.629
 let's get him out of here 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.629
 missed call 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.519
 everything is ok absolutely no problem 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:38.019
 everything works here you can also see 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.599
 can run 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:45.159
 for for certainly I can be confident 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.159
 run music 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.340
 absolutely everything works no problems 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.799
 under the screen there is no water so we buy 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.419
