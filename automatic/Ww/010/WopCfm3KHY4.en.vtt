configure<00:00:01.230> setup<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.280> little<00:00:02.460> bit

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
configure setup I I do a little bit

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.120 
configure setup I I do a little bit
different<00:00:02.970> method<00:00:03.270> were<00:00:03.780> similar<00:00:04.589> what<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.920> was

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
different method were similar what I was

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.369 
different method were similar what I was
saying<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.460> getting<00:00:06.060> sweeps<00:00:06.359> down<00:00:06.660> like

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
saying about getting sweeps down like

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.950 
saying about getting sweeps down like
this<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:08.160> might<00:00:08.970> start<00:00:09.269> something<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.750> would

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
this so I might start something I would

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.260 
this so I might start something I would
like<00:00:10.170> see<00:00:15.949> what<00:00:16.949> Greg<00:00:17.160> doing<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.760> -<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.150> you

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
like see what Greg doing here - is you

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.689 
like see what Greg doing here - is you
see<00:00:18.420> him<00:00:18.539> constructing<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.289> he's<00:00:19.980> he's<00:00:20.340> he's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
see him constructing it he's he's he's

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
see him constructing it he's he's he's
going<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.240> advanced<00:00:21.689> there<00:00:21.869> too

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
going a little advanced there too

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.710 
going a little advanced there too
so<00:00:22.680> again<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.519> let's<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.180> aware<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> we're

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
so again just let's be aware that we're

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
so again just let's be aware that we're
we're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:25.980> he's<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:26.699> doing<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
we're going here he's not doing this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.140 
we're going here he's not doing this
step<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.439> down<00:00:28.710> straight<00:00:29.340> body<00:00:29.670> that

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
step up and down straight body that

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.730 
step up and down straight body that
would<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.570> sort<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> mannequin<00:00:31.410> looking

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
would be sort of the mannequin looking

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.040 
would be sort of the mannequin looking
one<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.510> sort<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> pose

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
one you know the one is sort of the pose

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.530 
one you know the one is sort of the pose
of<00:00:34.290> most<00:00:34.500> action<00:00:35.010> figures<00:00:35.340> did<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.210> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
of most action figures did you see in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
of most action figures did you see in
the<00:00:36.930> toy<00:00:37.649> aisle<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.559> recommend<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.920> I'm

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the toy aisle you I recommend and I'm

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
the toy aisle you I recommend and I'm
sure<00:00:41.190> Greg<00:00:41.399> will<00:00:41.760> back<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.840> know

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
sure Greg will back it up that you know

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100 
sure Greg will back it up that you know
get<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.340> down<00:00:44.700> first<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.690> once

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
get that get that down first and once

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.080 
get that get that down first and once
you've<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.890> down<00:00:47.190> first<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.969> now

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you've got that down first you can now

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.840 
you've got that down first you can now
start<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.989> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.280> step<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
start to do which is this step which is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.369 
start to do which is this step which is
another<00:00:51.180> big<00:00:51.480> step<00:00:51.690> which<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:51.960> basically

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
another big step which is basically

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.479 
another big step which is basically
putting<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.010> motion

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
putting it in motion

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.220 
putting it in motion
which<00:00:53.940> becomes<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.480> big<00:00:54.690> deal<00:00:54.719> because

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
which becomes a big deal because

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.319 
which becomes a big deal because
otherwise<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.820> mannequin

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
otherwise you just look like a mannequin

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
otherwise you just look like a mannequin
that<00:00:57.390> looks<00:00:57.510> stiff<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that looks stiff but you need to get the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
that looks stiff but you need to get the
basics<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> body<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> question

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
basics of the body and now the question

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.660 
basics of the body and now the question
becomes<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.710> start<00:01:02.070> turning<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.489> body

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
becomes how do we start turning the body

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.380 
becomes how do we start turning the body
which<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> girl<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.790> put<00:01:05.790> together<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.210> couple

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
which of a girl so put together a couple

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
which of a girl so put together a couple
ideas<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.830> five<00:01:08.010> ropes<00:01:08.340> first<00:01:08.549> first<00:01:08.939> thing

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
ideas of five ropes first first thing

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
ideas of five ropes first first thing
and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> want<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.290> action<00:01:10.710> sweep<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and you want to get the action sweep in

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.810 
and you want to get the action sweep in
the<00:01:11.250> body<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.170> we've<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.820> okay

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the body right so we've got that okay

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.050 
the body right so we've got that okay
and<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.030> know

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and so I just go kind of like a you know

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
and so I just go kind of like a you know
almost<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.720> stickman<00:01:19.140> except<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
almost like a stickman except be a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
almost like a stickman except be a
little<00:01:19.890> bit<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> powder<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.720> take<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
little bit of powder and then I take it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
little bit of powder and then I take it
to<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> level<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:22.500> similar<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.369> using<00:01:23.840> Cupid

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to a level that's similar to using Cupid

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
to a level that's similar to using Cupid
cylinders<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.009> understand<00:01:26.400> my

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
cylinders so that I can understand my

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.160 
cylinders so that I can understand my
perspective<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> might<00:01:27.509> carry<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> line

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
perspective so I might carry this line

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
perspective so I might carry this line
here<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.369> represents<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
here and this now represents the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
here and this now represents the
underside<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> arm<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> you'll<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.369> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
underside of the arm that you'll see so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.130 
underside of the arm that you'll see so
if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> learners<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.540> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> break<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> down

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
if you learners I want to break it down

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.670 
if you learners I want to break it down
I<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> box<00:01:36.049> saying<00:01:37.049> how<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I have a box saying how I have this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.399 
I have a box saying how I have this
cylinder<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.840> always<00:01:40.110> put<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
cylinder think and you can always put a

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.889 
cylinder think and you can always put a
cylinder<00:01:40.710> inside<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.450> j-c<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.689> working

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
cylinder inside this j-c so I'm working

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350 
cylinder inside this j-c so I'm working
out<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.140> perspective<00:01:44.240> simultaneously<00:01:45.240> I'll

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
out my perspective simultaneously I'll

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.520 
out my perspective simultaneously I'll
do<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> side<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> body

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
do the same on the side of the body

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.440 
do the same on the side of the body
right<00:01:47.159> I've<00:01:47.280> got<00:01:47.460> these<00:01:47.579> sweeping<00:01:48.000> lines<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
right I've got these sweeping lines you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.110 
right I've got these sweeping lines you
know<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> build<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> torso<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.770> here

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
know we have to build a torso in here

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.850 
know we have to build a torso in here
a<00:01:50.180> rib<00:01:50.510> cage<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.290> know<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.500> might<00:01:51.650> bring

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
a rib cage you know you might bring

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.740 
a rib cage you know you might bring
start<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.700> shoulder<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.210> bring<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.540> sick

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
start the shoulder here bring the sick

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.530 
start the shoulder here bring the sick
line<00:01:54.020> down<00:01:54.320> say<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.640> now<00:01:55.760> we're<00:01:55.940> seeing<00:01:56.120> this

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
line down say and now we're seeing this

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.690 
line down say and now we're seeing this
plane<00:01:57.850> okay<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.810> I'm<00:02:00.110> still<00:02:00.320> I'm<00:02:00.710> building<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
plane okay so I'm still I'm building the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.870 
plane okay so I'm still I'm building the
same<00:02:01.970> kind<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.420> cubes<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.050> cylinders<00:02:03.760> but<00:02:04.760> I

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
same kind of cubes and cylinders but I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.990 
same kind of cubes and cylinders but I
started<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.810> sweeping<00:02:06.350> sweeping<00:02:06.890> lines<00:02:07.370> and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
started with sweeping sweeping lines and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.969 
started with sweeping sweeping lines and
now<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.180> have<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.540> motion<00:02:08.960> here<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.140> mean<00:02:09.830> I

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
now I have this motion here I mean I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.610 
now I have this motion here I mean I
know<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.250> perspective<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.150> this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
know the perspective is like this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.530 
know the perspective is like this
cylinders<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.070> it's<00:02:13.250> kind<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.610> melding<00:02:14.030> you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
cylinders so it's kind of a melding you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.250 
cylinders so it's kind of a melding you
know<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.930> these<00:02:15.530> two<00:02:15.740> styles<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.960> this<00:02:17.960> is<00:02:18.110> my

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
know of these two styles and this is my

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.500 
know of these two styles and this is my
approach<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.710> think<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.700> little<00:02:20.180> bit<00:02:20.420> of

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
approach I think you get a little bit of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.230 
approach I think you get a little bit of
a<00:02:20.600> looser<00:02:21.190> look<00:02:22.190> once<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.820> get<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.150> this

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
a looser look once you get to this

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.820 
a looser look once you get to this
approach<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.020> same<00:02:24.200> thing<00:02:24.230> happens

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
approach and see the same thing happens

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.070 
approach and see the same thing happens
here<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.250> carry<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.880> secondary<00:02:26.510> line<00:02:26.750> down

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
here I carry on a secondary line down

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.470 
here I carry on a secondary line down
and<00:02:27.500> now<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.770> see<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.400> have<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> another

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and now I see that I have a another

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.470 
and now I see that I have a another
inside<00:02:30.380> plane<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.760> how<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:31.940> set<00:02:32.330> up<00:02:32.360> my

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
inside plane and this is how I set up my

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.350 
inside plane and this is how I set up my
perspective<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.350> figure<00:02:33.710> using<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.940> is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
perspective on a figure using this is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.750 
perspective on a figure using this is
roping<00:02:36.320> method<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.040> what<00:02:37.130> we<00:02:37.220> times<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
roping method and what we times it is a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.490 
roping method and what we times it is a
more<00:02:38.000> advanced<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.990> they<00:02:39.080> do<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.440> just

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
more advanced if they do it you just

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.040 
more advanced if they do it you just
simple<00:02:40.130> wise<00:02:40.280> but<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.090> know<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.300> can<00:02:41.660> keep<00:02:41.870> it

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
simple wise but you know you can keep it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.280 
simple wise but you know you can keep it
more<00:02:42.350> together<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:43.400> know<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.900> never

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
more together you know and never

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.140 
more together you know and never
disconnect<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.950> sort<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.220> form<00:02:46.520> they<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:47.030> have

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
disconnect it sort of form they not have

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.730 
disconnect it sort of form they not have
scribbles

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
scribbles

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.370 
scribbles
I<00:02:48.910> certainly<00:02:49.910> do<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.570> way<00:02:50.750> still<00:02:51.020> okay

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
I certainly do it that way still okay

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.460 
I certainly do it that way still okay
but<00:02:52.390> if<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.510> get<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.780> level<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.110> confidence

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
but if you get to level of confidence

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.090 
but if you get to level of confidence
where<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.739> am<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.550> tend<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.270> use<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> few

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
where I am I tend to just use a few

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.310 
where I am I tend to just use a few
sweeping<00:02:58.100> lines<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.630> reason<00:02:59.959> let<00:03:00.260> me

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
sweeping lines and the reason let me

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.510 
sweeping lines and the reason let me
just<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:00.650> quick<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.010> reason<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.400> those

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
just be quick the reason that those

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.300 
just be quick the reason that those
quick<00:03:01.850> lines<00:03:02.120> matter<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:03.560> every<00:03:03.890> time<00:03:04.100> you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
quick lines matter that every time you

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.640 
quick lines matter that every time you
tighten<00:03:04.790> up<00:03:04.880> your<00:03:05.090> drawing<00:03:05.480> it's<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.500> gonna

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
tighten up your drawing it's just gonna

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.300 
tighten up your drawing it's just gonna
get<00:03:06.860> stiffer<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.760> stiffer<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:09.050> stiffer<00:03:09.680> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
get stiffer and stiffer and stiffer so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.640 
get stiffer and stiffer and stiffer so
that<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:11.180> right<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.900> gate<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.380> quicker

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
that so it's right the gate the quicker

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.470 
that so it's right the gate the quicker
you<00:03:12.890> can<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.700> papers<00:03:14.150> matter<00:03:14.390> of

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
you can just get it on papers matter of

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.210 
you can just get it on papers matter of
fact<00:03:14.630> sometimes<00:03:14.840> if<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.260> draw<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.560> like

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
fact sometimes if you draw it like

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.680 
fact sometimes if you draw it like
something<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.940> going<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.150> be<00:03:17.270> this<00:03:17.420> big

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
something that is going to be this big

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.570 
something that is going to be this big
if<00:03:18.110> you're<00:03:18.290> initially<00:03:18.770> draw<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.100> here<00:03:19.459> and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
if you're initially draw it here and

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.430 
if you're initially draw it here and
then<00:03:19.700> blow<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.209> because<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.020> can<00:03:21.170> draw<00:03:21.380> it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
then blow it up because you can draw it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.500 
then blow it up because you can draw it
real<00:03:21.650> quick<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.190> small<00:03:22.459> space<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.000> then

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
real quick in a small space and then

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.729 
real quick in a small space and then
blow<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:23.989> you're<00:03:24.140> gonna<00:03:24.230> get<00:03:24.410> you're<00:03:24.620> gonna

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
blow it up you're gonna get you're gonna

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.650 
blow it up you're gonna get you're gonna
get<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.950> lot<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.310> quick<00:03:25.489> movement<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.180> but

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
get a lot of quick movement on it but

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.240 
get a lot of quick movement on it but
what<00:03:26.989> ends<00:03:27.140> up<00:03:27.200> happening<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.770> if<00:03:27.890> sometimes

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
what ends up happening is if sometimes

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.100 
what ends up happening is if sometimes
if<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.610> go<00:03:28.760> straight<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.209> constructing

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
if you just go straight to constructing

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.570 
if you just go straight to constructing
a<00:03:30.350> pose

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
a pose

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.520 
a pose
it's<00:03:32.120> instead<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:32.959> getting<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.410> out

a mannequin instead of getting those no
sweets<00:03:42.350> down<00:03:42.560> then<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.100> again<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:44.510> was

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
sweets down then and again this was

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.380 
sweets down then and again this was
great<00:03:45.290> saying<00:03:45.560> don't<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.100> afraid<00:03:46.489> for<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
great saying don't be afraid for it to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.120 
great saying don't be afraid for it to
be<00:03:47.510> sort<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.959> little<00:03:47.989> jello<00:03:48.440> at<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
be sort of a little jello at the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.770 
be sort of a little jello at the
beginning<00:03:49.519> because<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.060> can<00:03:50.180> come<00:03:50.390> back<00:03:50.540> in

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
beginning because you can come back in

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.660 
beginning because you can come back in
there<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.110> refined<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.590> because<00:03:51.830> we<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.519> put

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
there and refined it because we can put

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.970 
there and refined it because we can put
two<00:03:52.790> layers<00:03:52.970> on<00:03:53.300> here<00:03:53.739> because<00:03:54.739> one<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:54.890> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
two layers on here because one of the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.949 
two layers on here because one of the
things<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.190> want<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.340> say<00:03:55.519> too<00:03:55.580> is<00:03:55.850> one<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
things I want to say too is one of the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.750 
things I want to say too is one of the
problems<00:03:57.410> when<00:03:57.950> you're<00:03:58.100> building<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.489> figure

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
problems when you're building a figure

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.450 
problems when you're building a figure
you<00:03:58.790> want<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.180> figure<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.540> look<00:03:59.570> natural

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
you want to figure to look natural

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.210 
you want to figure to look natural
and<00:04:00.810> when<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.900> get<00:04:02.080> into<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.440> construction

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
and when you get into this construction

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.730 
and when you get into this construction
line<00:04:04.120> set<00:04:04.480> what<00:04:04.720> tends<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.020> happen<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.560> end

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
line set what tends to happen is you end

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.950 
line set what tends to happen is you end
up<00:04:05.860> with<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.430> very<00:04:06.670> stiff<00:04:07.120> looking<00:04:07.510> figure<00:04:07.840> and

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
up with a very stiff looking figure and

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.260 
up with a very stiff looking figure and
then<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.140> square<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.740> off<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:10.000> doesn't

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
then you square it off and it doesn't

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.600 
then you square it off and it doesn't
look<00:04:10.360> very<00:04:10.420> natural<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:11.530> it's<00:04:11.680> only<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.070> human

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
look very natural like it's only a human

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.400 
look very natural like it's only a human

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
find motion and stillness even if even

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.130 
find motion and stillness even if even
if<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.070> body<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.670> standing<00:04:36.940> still<00:04:37.420> show<00:04:37.870> that

if a body is standing still show that

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.800 
if a body is standing still show that
it's<00:04:38.290> capable<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:39.130> movement<00:04:39.490> we've<00:04:40.390> all<00:04:40.540> seen

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
it's capable of movement we've all seen

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.470 
it's capable of movement we've all seen
the<00:04:40.930> bad<00:04:41.110> photographs<00:04:41.710> when<00:04:41.980> people<00:04:42.480> cause

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
the bad photographs when people cause

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.390 
the bad photographs when people cause
you<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.750> pain<00:04:44.050> your<00:04:44.230> God<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:47.500> they<00:04:48.100> show<00:04:48.340> you

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
you the pain your God and they show you

00:04:48.400 --> 00:05:01.770 
you the pain your God and they show you
here's<00:04:48.820> me<00:04:59.130> it's<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.250> boring<00:05:00.580> picture<00:05:01.180> right

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
here's me it's a boring picture right

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.230 
here's me it's a boring picture right
now<00:05:02.530> it'd<00:05:02.830> be<00:05:02.890> infinitely<00:05:03.730> more<00:05:04.180> interesting

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
now it'd be infinitely more interesting

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.650 
now it'd be infinitely more interesting
if<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.080> person<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.530> simply<00:05:05.680> just<00:05:05.980> doing<00:05:06.190> this

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
if the person is simply just doing this

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.180 
if the person is simply just doing this
now<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.900> break<00:05:08.350> in<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.590> hip<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:08.830> shows<00:05:09.040> that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
now a break in the hip that shows that

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.850 
now a break in the hip that shows that
the<00:05:09.310> body's<00:05:09.610> capable<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:10.450> movement<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:11.200> so

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
the body's capable of movement and so

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.140 
the body's capable of movement and so
one<00:05:12.040> of<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.220> things<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.580> happens<00:05:12.910> with<00:05:13.060> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
one of the things that happens with the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.730 
one of the things that happens with the
body<00:05:13.270> if<00:05:13.480> there's<00:05:13.660> this<00:05:13.870> local<00:05:14.380> motion<00:05:14.500> it

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
body if there's this local motion it

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.980 
body if there's this local motion it
happens<00:05:15.100> where<00:05:15.280> angles<00:05:16.060> are<00:05:16.330> always<00:05:16.810> shifting

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
happens where angles are always shifting

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.420 
happens where angles are always shifting
and<00:05:17.350> doing<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:17.890> happens<00:05:18.220> from<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
and doing this that happens from the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.610 
and doing this that happens from the
walk<00:05:18.640> when<00:05:19.270> I'm<00:05:19.450> goes<00:05:19.630> forward<00:05:19.990> one<00:05:20.230> leg<00:05:20.260> goes

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
walk when I'm goes forward one leg goes

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.040 
walk when I'm goes forward one leg goes
back<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.520> goes<00:05:21.580> when<00:05:21.910> we<00:05:21.940> stand<00:05:22.270> our<00:05:22.870> weight

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
back it goes when we stand our weight

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.620 
back it goes when we stand our weight
goes<00:05:23.260> up<00:05:23.290> on<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:24.130> hip<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:24.730> this<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.030> it<00:05:25.390> goes

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
goes up on this hip so this is it goes

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.630 
goes up on this hip so this is it goes
higher<00:05:25.930> but<00:05:26.470> what<00:05:26.680> happens<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.130> balance<00:05:27.550> the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
higher but what happens to balance the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.540 
higher but what happens to balance the
figure<00:05:27.910> is<00:05:28.000> because<00:05:28.360> shoulder<00:05:28.750> drops<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.740> keep

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
figure is because shoulder drops so keep

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.970 
figure is because shoulder drops so keep
your<00:05:30.910> angles<00:05:31.450> opposing<00:05:32.230> each<00:05:32.350> other<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:32.890> your

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
your angles opposing each other and your

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.400 
your angles opposing each other and your
figures<00:05:33.370> will<00:05:34.090> look<00:05:34.240> much<00:05:34.510> more<00:05:34.750> natural<00:05:34.930> and

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
of the tricks I use to make a figure

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.610 
of the tricks I use to make a figure
look<00:06:11.870> like<00:06:12.230> a<00:06:12.460> heavy<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.700> I<00:06:14.570> put<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:14.930> slight<00:06:15.260> bow

look like a heavy is I put a slight bow
in<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.700> shoulders<00:06:17.150> instead<00:06:17.930> of<00:06:18.020> the<00:06:18.139> draw<00:06:18.410> it

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
in the shoulders instead of the draw it

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.070 
in the shoulders instead of the draw it
squared<00:06:18.980> up<00:06:19.160> like<00:06:19.370> this<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:19.760> let<00:06:20.120> them<00:06:20.270> sad<00:06:20.630> just

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
squared up like this I let them sad just

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.950 
squared up like this I let them sad just
a<00:06:21.350> little<00:06:21.590> just<00:06:21.950> enough<00:06:22.150> so<00:06:23.150> that<00:06:23.180> you<00:06:23.600> feel

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
a little just enough so that you feel

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.170 
a little just enough so that you feel
the<00:06:24.320> weight<00:06:24.620> of<00:06:24.919> this<00:06:25.070> figure<00:06:25.430> coming<00:06:25.760> down

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
the weight of this figure coming down

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.030 
the weight of this figure coming down
it's<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:26.990> same<00:06:27.200> with<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:27.470> legs

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
it's the same with the legs

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.040 
it's the same with the legs
you<00:06:28.220> might<00:06:28.430> cook<00:06:28.669> just<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.150> slightest<00:06:29.750> Ben

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
you might cook just the slightest Ben

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.230 
you might cook just the slightest Ben
because<00:06:30.230> bones<00:06:30.500> bet<00:06:30.919> the<00:06:31.370> cones<00:06:31.760> didn't<00:06:32.060> Bend

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
because bones bet the cones didn't Bend

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.140 
because bones bet the cones didn't Bend
they<00:06:32.390> would<00:06:32.540> break<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:33.800> you<00:06:34.610> have<00:06:34.790> a<00:06:34.820> straight

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
they would break so you have a straight

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.270 
they would break so you have a straight
line<00:06:35.210> but<00:06:35.960> if<00:06:36.050> you<00:06:36.140> put<00:06:36.380> just<00:06:36.560> the<00:06:36.710> slightest

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
line but if you put just the slightest

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.870 
line but if you put just the slightest
bend<00:06:37.610> in<00:06:38.510> the<00:06:38.780> end<00:06:39.020> Oleg's<00:06:39.350> the<00:06:39.950> the<00:06:40.640> upper

bend in the end Oleg's the the upper
legs<00:06:41.060> and<00:06:41.210> lower<00:06:41.300> legs<00:06:41.450> again<00:06:42.230> you<00:06:42.410> start<00:06:42.740> to

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
feel the weight of this character and so

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.680 
feel the weight of this character and so
between<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:45.919> slight<00:06:46.760> rounded<00:06:47.210> shoulders
