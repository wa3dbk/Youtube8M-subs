similar to the Beauty Blender I mean
obviously<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.660> looks<00:00:12.719> totally<00:00:13.139> different<00:00:13.200> one

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
obviously it looks totally different one

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.110

of<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.860> great<00:00:14.009> things<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.490> sponge<00:00:14.790> is

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
of the great things about this sponge is

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.050 
of the great things about this sponge is
it<00:00:15.540> comes<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.170> little<00:00:16.580> holder<00:00:17.580> thing

makeup<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:55.039> think<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> fact

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
makeup which I like I think the fact

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.319 
makeup which I like I think the fact
that<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> sponge<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.329> wet<00:00:58.100> helps<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.520> with

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that the sponge is wet helps a lot with

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.380 
that the sponge is wet helps a lot with
the<00:01:01.289> blend<00:01:01.500> ability

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.310 

yeah<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.170> looks<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.800> pretty<00:01:10.210> even

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
yeah it looks like a pretty even

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.350 
yeah it looks like a pretty even
application<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:13.159> really<00:01:13.550> like<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.060> way<00:01:14.090> that

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
application I really like the way that

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.880 
application I really like the way that
it<00:01:14.540> feels<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.560> way<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:15.950> looks<00:01:17.890> looks

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
it feels and the way that it looks looks

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.780 
it feels and the way that it looks looks
pretty<00:01:19.220> good<00:01:21.250> overall<00:01:22.250> I'd<00:01:22.490> say<00:01:22.520> that<00:01:22.760> I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
pretty good overall I'd say that I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.570 
pretty good overall I'd say that I
really<00:01:23.090> like<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:23.360> product<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:24.290> was<00:01:24.500> $12<00:01:25.369> at

really like this product it was $12 at
sephora<00:01:26.080> which<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.800> lot<00:01:28.070> cheaper<00:01:28.100> than<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
sephora which is a lot cheaper than the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.460 
sephora which is a lot cheaper than the
Beauty<00:01:28.880> Blender<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.509> know<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.110> lot<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:30.380> people

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
have said that nothing compares to the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.969 
have said that nothing compares to the
actual<00:01:35.600> Beauty<00:01:35.900> Blender<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.350> egg-shaped<00:01:36.500> one

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
actual Beauty Blender the egg-shaped one

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.920 
actual Beauty Blender the egg-shaped one
I<00:01:37.280> don't<00:01:38.119> really<00:01:38.210> know<00:01:38.420> because<00:01:38.630> i<00:01:38.780> haven't

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
I don't really know because i haven't

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.290 
I don't really know because i haven't
used<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.290> Beauty<00:01:39.500> Blender<00:01:39.640> but<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.670> can<00:01:41.090> say

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
used the Beauty Blender but I can say

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.120 
used the Beauty Blender but I can say
that<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.780> definitely<00:01:42.350> think<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.920> worth

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
that I definitely think this is worth

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.300 
that I definitely think this is worth
twelve<00:01:44.030> dollars<00:01:44.390> go<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.440> unless<00:01:45.740> you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
twelve dollars go get it unless you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.620 
twelve dollars go get it unless you
already<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.789> Beauty<00:01:47.000> Blender<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.479> which

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
already have the Beauty Blender in which

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.840

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
case I would stick with the Beauty

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.880 
case I would stick with the Beauty
Blender<00:01:49.970> probably<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:50.840> if<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.289> need<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.530> cheap
