 6 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.330
 we are the pescara is right management that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.070
 we return to the city center there was 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.220
 we have seized this possibility 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.400
 flight and as I said before 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.980
 we worked for 5 6 months and at 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.830
 end ready and we are operative also here 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.280
 we didn't leave the old one because 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.860
 there remains the youth sector remains 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.229
 the ticket office therefore remains a great one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 a large chunk of work is behind 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.550
 this is how much this pescara is 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.310
 there are working people 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.020
 and therefore unfortunately the spaces are not enough 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.650
 never therefore the two sites will remain 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.650
 operating 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.219
 yes we took advantage of ours 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.520
 maximum photographer mucciante of his 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.890
 private collection and we will complete 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.229
 however also with others with other photos 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 who has so many and above all those a 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.280
 more representative of some moments 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.280
 of the history of nakata fishing 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.740
 at this location she is a graduate and designed e 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.600
 you have managed to realize a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.569
 project that you already had in mind from a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.569
 but if this is the obvious sign that 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.540
 this company always looks ahead is 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.819
 a company that works daily with 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.030
 all because then in the end 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.030
 who almost all the members have entered 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.040
 this venue put something of their own 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.400
 to pilgrims 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.840
 to finish in danilo who took care of all the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.989
 organizational part within then 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 we are always present and this is the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.879
 result of what we do 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.879
 daily 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.010
 now
