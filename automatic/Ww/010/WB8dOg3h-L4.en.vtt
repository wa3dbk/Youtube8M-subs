00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.729
 I have good with the comments on 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.139
 internet is that at least people they 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:11.129
 do not say everything and anything 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.230
 a gesture that is great is the guy who 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.910
 argue and fight with 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.320
 interposed comments this is not the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.450
 the most virile way in the world of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.430

 internet people do not weigh normal 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.030
 so this is the only place in the world where 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.350
 you can read for example that no one 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.350

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.100
