00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
sounds good but you're a little

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.460 
sounds good but you're a little
skeptical<00:00:31.239> about<00:00:31.449> using<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:32.020> all<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.259> time

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
skeptical about using it all the time

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.380 
skeptical about using it all the time
because<00:00:32.800> what<00:00:32.980> if<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.220> tube<00:00:33.430> goes<00:00:33.670> out<00:00:33.910> right

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
because what if the tube goes out right

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.360 
because what if the tube goes out right
yeah<00:00:34.750> it's<00:00:34.930> problem<00:00:35.320> with<00:00:35.410> these<00:00:35.500> mics<00:00:35.829> you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
yeah it's problem with these mics you

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.580 
yeah it's problem with these mics you
run<00:00:36.609> into<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.000> issue<00:00:37.030> where<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:38.320> burn<00:00:38.559> up

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
run into the issue where you burn up

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.080 
run into the issue where you burn up
them<00:00:38.920> d2<00:00:39.699> you<00:00:40.180> burn<00:00:40.449> up<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.829> some<00:00:42.160> mics<00:00:42.429> almost

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
them d2 you burn up and some mics almost

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.119 
them d2 you burn up and some mics almost
30<00:00:43.329> 40<00:00:43.690> %<00:00:44.019> of<00:00:44.109> the<00:00:44.199> value<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.649> mic<00:00:44.859> because

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
30 40 % of the value of the mic because

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.240 
30 40 % of the value of the mic because
tubes<00:00:45.609> are<00:00:45.760> getting<00:00:45.969> hard<00:00:46.179> to<00:00:46.300> find<00:00:46.570> so<00:00:47.440> when

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
tubes are getting hard to find so when

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.130 
tubes are getting hard to find so when
I've<00:00:48.370> been<00:00:48.399> trying<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.820> figure<00:00:49.030> out<00:00:49.359> is<00:00:49.629> way<00:00:50.079> to

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
I've been trying to figure out is way to

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.160 
I've been trying to figure out is way to
continue<00:00:50.769> to<00:00:51.010> keep<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.309> mic<00:00:51.640> operational<00:00:52.600> but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
continue to keep the mic operational but

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.049 
continue to keep the mic operational but
know<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.350> I<00:00:53.589> still<00:00:53.920> honor<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.429> value<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
know that I still honor the value of the

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.669 
know that I still honor the value of the
tube<00:00:55.269> so<00:00:55.570> when<00:00:55.719> it<00:00:55.809> comes<00:00:55.989> time<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.260> sell<00:00:56.649> it

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
tube so when it comes time to sell it

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.189 
tube so when it comes time to sell it
there's<00:00:57.579> still<00:00:57.910> something<00:00:58.210> there<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:59.079> get

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
there's still something there to get

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.619 
there's still something there to get

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
more original seat walls that came out

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.760 
more original seat walls that came out
of<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.280> era<00:01:30.780> low<00:01:31.780> end<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.230> not<00:01:32.380> something

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
of that era low end is not something

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.290 
of that era low end is not something
that<00:01:32.860> comes<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.280> mind<00:01:33.490> when<00:01:33.730> you<00:01:33.760> think<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.150> a

that comes to mind when you think of a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.320 
that comes to mind when you think of a
c12<00:01:34.960> but<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:35.980> particular<00:01:36.340> mic<00:01:36.760> does<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.300> a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
much cleaner nicer bottom end and what

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.110 
much cleaner nicer bottom end and what
you<00:01:41.050> get<00:01:41.290> out<00:01:41.530> of<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.770> regular<00:01:41.950> c12<00:01:42.610> microphone

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120

I personally pulling my 67 s out quite a

I personally pulling my 67 s out quite a
bit<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:53.260> pape<00:02:53.560> c12<00:02:54.070> gets<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.430> lot<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.640> mileage

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
bit that pape c12 gets a lot of mileage

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.500 
bit that pape c12 gets a lot of mileage
on<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.360> too<00:02:55.570> because<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.410> got<00:02:56.740> it<00:02:56.980> rather<00:02:57.510> it's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
on it too because I got it rather it's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.420 
on it too because I got it rather it's
certainly<00:02:58.750> compared<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.410> vintage<00:02:59.830> c12

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
certainly compared to what a vintage c12

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.150 
certainly compared to what a vintage c12
goes<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.880> got<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.650> inexpensive<00:03:02.650> compared

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
goes for I got it inexpensive compared

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.340 
goes for I got it inexpensive compared
to<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.120> don't<00:03:04.180> mind<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.930> most<00:03:05.110> of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
to that so I don't mind and most of

to that so I don't mind and most of
stuff<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.740> goes<00:03:05.890> wrong<00:03:06.190> with<00:03:06.400> those<00:03:06.580> those

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300

microphones can still be obtained and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.830 
microphones can still be obtained and
repaired<00:03:09.580> for<00:03:09.850> less<00:03:09.970> than<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.240> thousand<00:03:10.660> bucks

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840

still<00:03:13.630> be<00:03:13.810> had<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:14.560> I'm<00:03:14.650> not<00:03:14.770> afraid<00:03:14.920> of

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160

so<00:03:18.520> between<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.030> mics<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.630> use<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.050> most

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
so between the mics that I use the most

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.040 
so between the mics that I use the most
probably<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.800> seat<00:03:21.010> wall<00:03:21.280> or<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.120> u67

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
probably the seat wall or the u67

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.570 
probably the seat wall or the u67
because<00:03:23.440> they're<00:03:23.560> great<00:03:23.770> mics<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.220> get<00:03:24.340> great

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
because they're great mics you get great

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.520 
because they're great mics you get great
results<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.270> they're<00:03:25.870> pretty<00:03:26.170> easy<00:03:26.350> to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
results and they're pretty easy to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.590 
results and they're pretty easy to
repair<00:03:26.890> when<00:03:27.100> something<00:03:27.400> goes<00:03:27.550> south<00:03:27.610> well

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600
