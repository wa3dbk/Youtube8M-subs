00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
only issue I have with this LP and it's

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.210 
only issue I have with this LP and it's
one<00:04:39.650> that<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:40.010> can't<00:04:40.310> completely<00:04:40.790> ignore<00:04:41.330> it's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
one that I can't completely ignore it's

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.870 
one that I can't completely ignore it's
with<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.850> vocals<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.660> lead<00:04:44.950> vocals<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:46.220> like
