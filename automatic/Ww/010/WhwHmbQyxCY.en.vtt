 ens 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.839
 the lion king here just came from the goalkeeper and is very common when people 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.810
 brings a jet of the vet's bath 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.800
 they fight when we put them back in their nature 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 It's good to say 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.160
 so the first thing we do is bring a cat protected in a 

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.840
 shipping box 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.370
 and lets 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 the smell of them already the fight will get used 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.770
 I'm going to let go a little bit before that, just to see how you can go out and play 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.770
 even some cases are already getting a little stressed 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.960
 with a coexisting water coexist we can inhibit something more 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.640
 aggressive neale for example 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.850
 if he only has garden lopes we leave but if the cat mia to give 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 a kick to us nor 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 I'm prepared here. What an aggression. 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.200
 That's why it's aggressive. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.240
 bolt will go by for the time the result leaves him then turned back 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 in these hours we should also take great care 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 because sometimes they end up not knowing also that they are wanting 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.689
 advocate 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.720
 Then the cat is already going to the lopes. 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.290
 that me or my cat did not come here to fight with them there then, a little 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.710
 smell the other boy they get used to it and everything comes back to 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.010
 normal again 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.850
 Look here 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.130
 It's no wonder it's already better. 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.060
 so with the trick we little the first five minutes here in the confused 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.799
 very well 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.799
 he read the king 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.069
 good plus a tip one should avoid if a cat takes control of the space and 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.599
 be scared all the time another because otherwise born can be hidden 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.349
 all the time 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 So it's okay here, it's not very compact. 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.290
 and do not be afraid to go back if you do not feel safe in the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.279
 situation 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.929
 put the cat back in the transport box and wait a little longer and 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.370
 this tip is valid for any cat you want to add a group 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:48.159
 new 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.749
 these tips were offered by kurt shell 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.219
 more health care than state health care according to each stage of living expenses
