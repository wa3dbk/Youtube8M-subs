 with the grandiosity of lancome which 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.290
 is a first step in the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.290

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.190
 by asking the middle him fossils the corner 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.190
 external 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.650

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.210
 from make up for ever 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.490
 I start with the chorus of the mouth 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.490
 and I go back from the commissure no 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.260
 I then decide the middle of the lip 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.410
 lower and I'm leaving from the outside 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.000
 to join the middle when you 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.780
 make a dark mouth look to have 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.040
 perfect symmetry I created a 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.040

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.300
 and 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.439
 I start with the hollow of my cheekbone 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.759

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:51.759
 final result but I hope this 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.959
