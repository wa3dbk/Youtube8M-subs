redstone repeater face the command
blocks<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.470> top<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.769> one<00:02:15.980> jump<00:02:17.410> we<00:02:18.410> go<00:02:18.819> so

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
blocks on top of this one jump we go so

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.130 
blocks on top of this one jump we go so
we're<00:02:19.940> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.269> click<00:02:20.299> on<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.840> first

we're going to right click on the first
command<00:02:21.650> block<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.760> are<00:02:22.849> going<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.120> say<00:02:23.890> /

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
command block and we are going to say /

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.640 
command block and we are going to say /
x<00:02:26.920> p<00:02:28.989> minus<00:02:31.690> whatever<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:32.959> going<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.139> cost<00:02:33.319> in

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
x p minus whatever it's going to cost in

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.629 
x p minus whatever it's going to cost in
levels<00:02:34.130> were<00:02:34.670> doing<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:34.970> remember<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:37.459> is

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
levels were doing this remember this is

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.150 
levels were doing this remember this is
like<00:02:37.850> minus<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.540> your<00:02:38.660> levels<00:02:38.989> lot<00:02:39.889> money

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
like minus in your levels lot money

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.180 
like minus in your levels lot money
whatever<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> um<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:44.000> say<00:02:44.120> five<00:02:45.019> levels<00:02:45.470> so

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
whatever so um just say five levels so

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:56.949 
whatever so um just say five levels so
put<00:02:46.480> 50<00:02:49.750> pence<00:02:50.799> at<00:02:51.880> p<00:02:53.530> which<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:55.959> target

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
put 50 pence at p which is target

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.920 
put 50 pence at p which is target
nearest<00:02:57.230> player<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.420> then<00:02:59.420> you're<00:02:59.630> going<00:02:59.750> to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
nearest player and then you're going to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.410 
nearest player and then you're going to
put<00:03:00.799> another<00:03:00.889> space<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.940> think<00:03:02.209> no<00:03:03.049> no<00:03:04.269> put<00:03:05.269> a

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
put another space I think no no put a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.879 
put another space I think no no put a
bracket<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:08.480> L<00:03:08.720> M<00:03:09.130> equals<00:03:11.410> 5<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
bracket and then L M equals 5 the

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.589 
bracket and then L M equals 5 the
amounts<00:03:13.419> of<00:03:14.419> levels<00:03:15.730> now<00:03:16.730> close<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> brackets

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
amounts of levels now close the brackets

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.559 
amounts of levels now close the brackets
and<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:18.709> done<00:03:19.280> boom<00:03:20.859> so<00:03:22.209> now<00:03:23.209> we're<00:03:23.419> going<00:03:23.510> to

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
and then done boom so now we're going to
