fun playability with it as well if you
haven't<00:01:31.020> played<00:01:31.200> him<00:01:31.290> yet<00:01:31.439> since<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
haven't played him yet since they just

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.649 
haven't played him yet since they just
tweaked<00:01:32.729> him<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> made<00:01:33.150> him<00:01:33.180> different<00:01:33.390> I

think you should definitely at least

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.260 
think you should definitely at least
play<00:01:35.040> him<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.640> his<00:01:35.729> new<00:01:35.909> kits<00:01:36.119> all

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
play him to see what his new kits all

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
about and just just try it out it's fun

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.190 
about and just just try it out it's fun
it's<00:01:38.939> nice<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.299> three<00:01:39.570> turrets<00:01:39.810> again

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's nice to have three turrets again

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's nice to have three turrets again
like<00:01:40.799> way<00:01:41.159> back<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> day<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> used

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
like way back in the day that you used

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
like way back in the day that you used
to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.540> able<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.780> do<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.040> think<00:01:44.159> he's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to be able to do and I just think he's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
to be able to do and I just think he's
in<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.610> place<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.659> these

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in a better place because of all these

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.030 
in a better place because of all these
tweaks<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> changes<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> haven't
