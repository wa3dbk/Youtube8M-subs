00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.779
 the moment 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.070
 bernard l 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.300
 this year's gaming festival 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.949
 but what is to come 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.830
 as always happens in December if you need to invest in people bet on 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.169
 2010 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.590
 This time was not different 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.670
 the most sensitive ads and took all our 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.860
 the expectations 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 what about the new bang on the return of the immortal as an actress 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.090
 all looked like fixed assets for next year 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.460
 but none is up to itatiaia 3 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.520
 What started as a monster is one of the biggest promises for 2010 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.380
 the e3 trailer for this team 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.380
 made everyone hear how to burn the year 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.690
 I could also 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.090
 senator and was able to perform exceptional work and India 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.850
 nothing more obvious than expecting something even better in its sequence the same 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300
 the others make us believe that yes 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.460
 besides having a completely new scenario the story seems so engaging 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.490
 account of the first two matches 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030
 4 7 million 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.320
 graphic quality also presses 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.410
 what else makes us want to play and train hard was a cooperative way 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.870
 it seems 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.910
 two players were able to control the traffic and solid victor 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.350
 simultaneously during opening 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.180
 we have pending after being dismissed 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.170
 we can only hope for the best of life 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.050
 therefore 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.740
 during the e3 3 of this team is the most anticipated film for 2010 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 my expectations are great 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.020
 participant you want 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.880
 maybe but for now we bet all your chips in the house many others 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 the House 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.030
 not
