00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
quite the same I don't know it's hard to

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.220 
quite the same I don't know it's hard to
compare<00:00:43.820> running<00:00:44.540> around<00:00:44.720> on<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:44.930> field<00:00:45.110> to

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.360 
flying but I think it's as close as we
can<00:00:47.449> get<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.750> yeah<00:00:48.290> it<00:00:48.680> would<00:00:48.800> be<00:00:48.890> more<00:00:49.100> fun<00:00:49.129> to
