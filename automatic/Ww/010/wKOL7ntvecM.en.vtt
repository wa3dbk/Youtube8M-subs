00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
a failure and let up and it's about this

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.660 
a failure and let up and it's about this
point<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.210> ready<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:50.540> Kolchak

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.699 

it<00:03:55.090> needs<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.510> be<00:03:55.630> given<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.990> fright<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.290> order

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
it needs to be given a fright in order

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.290 
it needs to be given a fright in order
to<00:03:56.800> start<00:03:57.099> reproduction<00:03:57.730> which<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.000> what<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
to start reproduction which is what the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.130 
to start reproduction which is what the
bus

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.800 

so<00:04:05.710> altogether<00:04:05.950> we've<00:04:06.460> now<00:04:06.670> spent<00:04:07.030> 12<00:04:07.510> weeks

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
so altogether we've now spent 12 weeks

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.700 
so altogether we've now spent 12 weeks
three<00:04:08.560> months<00:04:09.210> get<00:04:10.210> to<00:04:10.360> this<00:04:10.510> point

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.980 

and<00:04:13.800> these<00:04:14.730> are<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> difficult<00:04:15.450> steps<00:04:15.690> the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
and these are the difficult steps the

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.100 
and these are the difficult steps the
step<00:04:16.740> from<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.040> into<00:04:17.640> fruiting<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.300> much

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
step from here into fruiting is much

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.300 
step from here into fruiting is much
quicker<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:20.210> much<00:04:21.210> more<00:04:21.540> controllable<00:04:22.310> don't

the<00:05:29.370> world<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.670> in<00:05:29.820> there's<00:05:29.970> about<00:05:30.030> 12<00:05:30.890> it's

days<00:05:34.320> comes<00:05:35.280> back<00:05:35.550> on<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.760> shelf<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:37.260> within

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
days comes back on the shelf and within

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.330 
days comes back on the shelf and within
the<00:05:37.680> next<00:05:37.860> 12<00:05:38.190> days<00:05:38.280> cycle<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.870> can<00:05:40.080> see<00:05:40.380> the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
the next 12 days cycle you can see the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.870 
the next 12 days cycle you can see the
mushrooms<00:05:41.550> beginning<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.270> form<00:05:42.480> a<00:05:42.630> game<00:05:42.860> right

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
mushrooms beginning to form a game right

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.310 
mushrooms beginning to form a game right
so<00:05:44.880> there's<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.210> second<00:05:45.570> flush<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.140> goes

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
so there's a second flush and it goes

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.280 
so there's a second flush and it goes
through<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:46.620> one<00:05:46.950> more<00:05:47.160> time

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.720 

so<00:05:52.290> what<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.530> this<00:05:52.620> growing<00:05:52.890> here<00:05:53.100> this<00:05:53.550> is<00:05:53.700> a

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
so what is this growing here this is a

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.820 
so what is this growing here this is a
pink<00:05:54.000> oyster<00:05:54.150> pink<00:05:54.720> oyster<00:05:54.870> and<00:05:55.320> it's<00:05:55.470> got<00:05:55.620> two

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
pink oyster pink oyster and it's got two

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.390 
pink oyster pink oyster and it's got two
glasses<00:05:56.130> on<00:05:56.580> pay<00:05:56.850> on<00:05:57.090> you

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.000 

and<00:05:59.729> that<00:06:00.300> girls<00:06:00.570> differently<00:06:01.080> -<00:06:01.290> would<00:06:04.010> this

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
and that girls differently - would this

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.540 
and that girls differently - would this
this<00:06:05.310> is<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.490> tropical<00:06:07.100> mushroom<00:06:08.100> but<00:06:08.250> needs<00:06:08.430> a

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
this is a tropical mushroom but needs a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.129 
this is a tropical mushroom but needs a
lot<00:06:08.760> more<00:06:08.790> humidity<00:06:09.270> than<00:06:09.690> then<00:06:10.139> is<00:06:10.260> in<00:06:10.410> here

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
lot more humidity than then is in here

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.980 
lot more humidity than then is in here
but<00:06:13.139> it's<00:06:13.290> put<00:06:13.680> it<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:13.949> track<00:06:14.419> so<00:06:15.419> we<00:06:15.630> use<00:06:15.810> the

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
but it's put it to track so we use the

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:23.030 
but it's put it to track so we use the
space<00:06:16.310> principally<00:06:17.310> doing<00:06:21.710> during<00:06:22.710> the

now<00:06:26.240> there<00:06:26.570> is<00:06:26.930> an<00:06:27.080> infinitely<00:06:27.590> more

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
now there is an infinitely more
