over anyway like make those flying about
to<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> cross<00:02:39.300> chop<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.100> whatnot<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.340> know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
to a cross chop on you whatnot you know

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.800 
to a cross chop on you whatnot you know
it's<00:02:41.730> actually<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.270> posable<00:02:42.780> figure

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it's actually a really posable figure

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.410 
it's actually a really posable figure
beam<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.440> look<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
beam to look at I actually like the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.870 
beam to look at I actually like the
cities'<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.530> don't<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.770> how<00:02:47.370> how

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
cities' but I just don't like how how

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.100 
cities' but I just don't like how how
failed<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.680> yeah<00:02:49.940> really

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
failed it was yeah really

yeah<00:02:52.460> almost<00:02:53.460> kind<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.910> thing<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.510> that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
yeah almost kind of thing is is that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.150 
yeah almost kind of thing is is that
these<00:02:54.810> figures<00:02:55.260> were<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.710> expensive<00:02:55.950> -

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
these figures were really expensive -

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.770 
these figures were really expensive -
they're<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.460> twelve<00:02:57.090> thirty<00:02:57.510> dollar

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
they're like twelve thirty dollar

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.810 
they're like twelve thirty dollar
figures<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.470> wow<00:02:58.770> really<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.520> worth<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
figures like wow really is it worth it

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.510 
figures like wow really is it worth it
in<00:03:00.330> some<00:03:00.660> ways<00:03:00.870> yes<00:03:01.290> some<00:03:01.710> ways<00:03:01.920> no<00:03:02.250> because

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
in some ways yes some ways no because

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.980 
in some ways yes some ways no because
they're<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:02.820> paint<00:03:03.120> missing<00:03:03.510> from<00:03:03.690> certain

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
they're like paint missing from certain

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.470 
they're like paint missing from certain
thing<00:03:04.260> yeah<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.890> all<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.340> mastodons<00:03:06.120> shield

thing yeah like all the mastodons shield
it's<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.990> loving<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.590> face<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.370> our

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
it's not loving on the face and it's our

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.770 
it's not loving on the face and it's our
sanitized<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.000> save<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.270> target<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.630> no

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
sanitized and save the target is no

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.440 
sanitized and save the target is no
paint<00:03:10.080> our<00:03:10.200> sides<00:03:10.440> yes<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.820> something<00:03:12.270> to

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
paint our sides yes like something to

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.540 
paint our sides yes like something to
which<00:03:12.960> they<00:03:13.230> were<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.040> something<00:03:14.340> is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
which they were there and something is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.420 
which they were there and something is
you<00:03:14.790> wish<00:03:14.940> they<00:03:15.120> were<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.420> there<00:03:15.630> but<00:03:16.190> we<00:03:17.190> call

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you wish they were not there but we call

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.580 
you wish they were not there but we call
this<00:03:17.610> these<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.150> really<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.960> stand<00:03:19.200> really

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
this these are really the stand really

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.350 
this these are really the stand really
does<00:03:19.770> help<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.400> possibility<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.270> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
does help the possibility with the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.870 
does help the possibility with the
figure<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.260> does<00:03:22.440> move<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.920> bricks<00:03:23.400> moves

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
figure and it does move the bricks moves

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.730 
figure and it does move the bricks moves
for<00:03:24.690> something<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.200> haven't<00:03:25.380> had<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
for something that we haven't had in a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.940 
for something that we haven't had in a
while<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:26.070> waste<00:03:26.400> does<00:03:26.790> move<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:27.990> like<00:03:28.800> this

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
while a waste does move so I like this

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.160 
while a waste does move so I like this
it's<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.760> way<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.480> or<00:03:30.630> whatever<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.050> know

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
it's this way and or whatever you know

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.130 
it's this way and or whatever you know
it's<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.220> really<00:03:32.370> posable<00:03:32.850> figure<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.390> really

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it's a really posable figure I really

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's a really posable figure I really
like<00:03:34.290> these<00:03:34.440> clothes<00:03:34.680> ability<00:03:35.070> but<00:03:35.220> other

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
like these clothes ability but other

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.400 
like these clothes ability but other
than<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.030> figure<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.570> Twilight<00:03:37.110> detail

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
than that the figure the Twilight detail

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.530 
than that the figure the Twilight detail
wave<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.430> had<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.900> Megazord<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.730> RPM

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
wave one had the Megazord the the RPM

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.020 
wave one had the Megazord the the RPM
high<00:03:42.810> octane<00:03:43.320> Megazord<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.160> law<00:03:44.910> of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
force Megazord they were the waffles was

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.370 
force Megazord they were the waffles was
really<00:03:47.280> bottom<00:03:47.760> heavy<00:03:47.940> because<00:03:48.450> though<00:03:49.050> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
really bottom heavy because though the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.810 
really bottom heavy because though the
weight<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.800> bowl<00:03:50.010> was<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.460> heavy<00:03:50.640> for

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
weight on the bowl was really heavy for

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.980 
weight on the bowl was really heavy for
something<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.180> guess<00:03:51.330> they<00:03:51.420> put<00:03:51.600> some<00:03:51.720> kind<00:03:51.900> of

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
something I guess they put some kind of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.030 
something I guess they put some kind of
Magnus<00:03:52.410> what<00:03:52.530> they're<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:52.920> was<00:03:53.010> really

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
Magnus what they're on it was really

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.000 
Magnus what they're on it was really
heavy<00:03:53.400> come

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
heavy come

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.860 
heavy come
four<00:03:54.340> months<00:03:54.489> all<00:03:54.970> right<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.330> now<00:03:55.510> we<00:03:55.569> have<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
four months all right so now we have the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.600 
four months all right so now we have the
wave<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.200> figure<00:03:56.500> which<00:03:56.680> was<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.099> last<00:03:57.370> and

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
wave to figure which was the last and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.289 
wave to figure which was the last and
finally<00:03:58.000> we<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:59.230> most<00:03:59.470> limited<00:03:59.950> way

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
finally we have and the most limited way

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.330 
finally we have and the most limited way
when<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.330> say<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.629> that's<00:04:01.870> because<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:03.069> can't

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
when I say is that's because you can't

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.000 
when I say is that's because you can't
you<00:04:03.549> really<00:04:03.760> couldn't<00:04:04.060> find<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.420> um<00:04:04.680> Lily<00:04:05.680> too

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
you really couldn't find it um Lily too

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.130 
you really couldn't find it um Lily too
