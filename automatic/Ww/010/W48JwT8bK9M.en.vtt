above by people i believe all of them
had<00:01:34.799> above<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.579> KD<00:01:36.290> well<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
had above it to KD well that's not a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.950 
had above it to KD well that's not a
real<00:01:38.340> estimation<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.850> skilled<00:01:39.180> very<00:01:39.869> well

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
real estimation of skilled very well

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.380 
real estimation of skilled very well
dashboard<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.560> whatever<00:01:40.759> but<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.909> had<00:01:42.030> some

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
dashboard or whatever but they had some

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
dashboard or whatever but they had some
of<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.570> had<00:01:42.720> three<00:01:42.960> high<00:01:43.079> win<00:01:43.259> losses<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.860> i

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
of them had three high win losses so i

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.670 
of them had three high win losses so i
don't<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> best<00:01:48.720> idea<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
don't know but the best idea is to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
don't know but the best idea is to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
patrol an area of the map so as you can

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.520 
patrol an area of the map so as you can
see<00:01:52.110> i'm<00:01:52.340> sticking<00:01:53.340> around<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:54.270> area<00:01:54.530> for

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.569 
far left side right here and the other
one<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:04.920> into<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> middle<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.399> can

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
one is if I go into the middle I can

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.490 
one is if I go into the middle I can
pretty<00:02:05.700> much<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:06.180> three<00:02:06.840> cores<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> map

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
pretty much see three cores of the map

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.219 
pretty much see three cores of the map
just<00:02:07.530> from<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.099> area<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.720> main<00:02:09.899> spawn

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
just from that area the main spawn

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.589 
just from that area the main spawn
points<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.709> back<00:02:10.979> where<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.280> aiming<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
points are back where I'm aiming back to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.770 
points are back where I'm aiming back to
my<00:02:12.720> right

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
my right

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.070 
my right
to<00:02:14.740> my<00:02:14.980> right<00:02:15.580> down<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.030> stairs<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.390> my<00:02:16.540> down

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
to my right down the stairs to my down

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.590 
to my right down the stairs to my down
the<00:02:17.200> left<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:18.550> little<00:02:18.790> farther<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.300> there

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
the left and a little farther back there

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.130 
the left and a little farther back there
so<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:22.060> key<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.420> i'm<00:02:22.480> doing<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> well

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
so the key that i'm doing is well

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.770 
so the key that i'm doing is well
especially<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:23.680> sitrep<00:02:24.010> pro<00:02:24.130> i<00:02:24.490> have<00:02:25.480> my<00:02:25.600> mic

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
especially with sitrep pro i have my mic

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.240 
especially with sitrep pro i have my mic
in<00:02:25.990> i'm<00:02:26.110> not<00:02:26.230> really<00:02:26.380> talking<00:02:26.890> i'm<00:02:27.010> just

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
in i'm not really talking i'm just

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.430 
in i'm not really talking i'm just
really<00:02:28.030> listening<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.750> main<00:02:32.050> point<00:02:32.380> that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
really listening and the main point that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.620 
really listening and the main point that
i<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.770> say<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.480> your

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
i can say is that you have to have your

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.360 
i can say is that you have to have your
head<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.930> swivel<00:02:35.020> at<00:02:35.410> all<00:02:35.500> times<00:02:35.770> put<00:02:36.250> down

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
head on a swivel at all times put down

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.790 
head on a swivel at all times put down
my<00:02:36.459> portable<00:02:36.880> radar<00:02:37.410> oddly<00:02:38.410> enough<00:02:38.440> they're

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
my portable radar oddly enough they're

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.410 
my portable radar oddly enough they're
not<00:02:38.920> running<00:02:39.040> assassin<00:02:39.670> probably<00:02:40.180> because

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
not running assassin probably because

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.510 
not running assassin probably because
they're<00:02:40.569> just<00:02:40.720> trying<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.020> win<00:02:41.260> gunfights<00:02:41.800> not

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
they're just trying to win gunfights not

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
keep up their precious katie's but you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.310 
keep up their precious katie's but you
know<00:02:46.239> it's<00:02:46.360> very<00:02:46.390> rare<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.959> full<00:02:47.140> team

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
know it's very rare for a full team

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.780 
know it's very rare for a full team
especially<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:48.100> good<00:02:48.610> players<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.700> know

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
especially of good players and you know

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.130 
especially of good players and you know
the<00:02:51.940> try<00:02:52.120> hearts<00:02:52.360> they<00:02:52.480> always<00:02:52.690> run<00:02:52.930> dead

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the try hearts they always run dead

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.570 
the try hearts they always run dead
man's<00:02:53.320> hand<00:02:53.440> or<00:02:53.650> they're<00:02:53.980> actually<00:02:54.250> at<00:02:54.340> level

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
man's hand or they're actually at level

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.729 
man's hand or they're actually at level
28<00:02:54.880> clan<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.860> they<00:02:57.459> were<00:02:57.519> really<00:02:57.940> not<00:02:58.739> walking

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
28 clan so they were really not walking

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.130 
28 clan so they were really not walking
apart<00:03:00.069> but<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.550> was<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.090> out<00:03:01.239> shooting<00:03:01.780> them<00:03:01.930> I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
apart but I was just out shooting them I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.229 
apart but I was just out shooting them I
had<00:03:02.980> my<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.640> guess<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.010> did<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:06.819> you<00:03:06.850> notice<00:03:07.150> I

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
had my I guess now I did if you notice I

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.880 
had my I guess now I did if you notice I
didn't<00:03:07.480> go<00:03:07.569> outside<00:03:07.720> because<00:03:08.170> there's<00:03:08.560> so

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
didn't go outside because there's so

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.380 
didn't go outside because there's so
many<00:03:08.980> possibilities<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.760> where<00:03:09.970> people<00:03:10.120> could

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
many possibilities of where people could

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.270 
many possibilities of where people could
date<00:03:10.540> I'd<00:03:11.290> go<00:03:11.470> up<00:03:11.500> here<00:03:11.830> where<00:03:12.040> there's<00:03:12.190> only

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
date I'd go up here where there's only

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.559 
date I'd go up here where there's only
two<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:14.350> just<00:03:14.380> pick<00:03:14.650> him<00:03:14.769> off<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:16.360> is

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
two and I just pick him off so really is

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.819 
two and I just pick him off so really is
maneuvering<00:03:17.170> around<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> map<00:03:17.500> as<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.709> can

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
maneuvering around the map as you can

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.229 
maneuvering around the map as you can
see<00:03:17.950> that's<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.280> major<00:03:18.459> spawn<00:03:18.820> point<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.209> I

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
see that's a major spawn point and I

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.840 
see that's a major spawn point and I
almost<00:03:19.360> died<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.670> play

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
almost died but you just have to play

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.789 
almost died but you just have to play
smart<00:03:21.910> they<00:03:22.870> can<00:03:23.019> spawn<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.380> back<00:03:23.530> by

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
smart they can spawn in the back by

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.670 
smart they can spawn in the back by
there<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.810> know<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.290> stay<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.620> this

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
there and I know if I stay in this

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.560 
there and I know if I stay in this
middle<00:03:26.920> area<00:03:27.100> they<00:03:27.940> can<00:03:28.090> either<00:03:28.180> go<00:03:28.390> from

there are always people in the windows
and<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:33.070> thought<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.310> would<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.549> take<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> second

take a second peer through these little
sheets<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:40.079> Steel<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.950> see<00:03:42.070> if<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.310> see
