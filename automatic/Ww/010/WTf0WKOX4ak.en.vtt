00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
open sourcing of nes emulator that does

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
open sourcing of nes emulator that does
a<00:00:25.830> decent<00:00:26.039> job<00:00:26.250> supports<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.029> great<00:00:27.330> number<00:00:27.840> of

the different mappers and whatnot are

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.990 
the different mappers and whatnot are
available<00:00:31.009> it's<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.189> obvious<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.730> they

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
available it's pretty obvious that they

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540

went<00:00:33.180> ahead<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.540> did<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.140> qml<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.920> but

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
went ahead and did this in qml here but

here on the bottom and as you can see
it's<00:01:14.490> quite<00:01:14.580> nicely

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.830 

as<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.210> can<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:51.100> game<00:01:52.100> works<00:01:52.370> pretty<00:01:52.520> well

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
as you can see game works pretty well

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.469 
as you can see game works pretty well
right<00:01:53.840> now<00:01:53.900> I<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.340> no<00:01:55.610> real<00:01:55.880> easy<00:01:56.119> way<00:01:56.330> to

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
right now I there is no real easy way to

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.780 
right now I there is no real easy way to
take<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.869> close<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.200> off<00:01:57.500> without<00:01:58.220> going<00:01:58.580> into

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
take and close it off without going into

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.280 
take and close it off without going into
the<00:01:58.910> emulator<00:01:59.270> menus<00:01:59.660> which<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.990> kind<00:02:00.229> of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the emulator menus which is kind of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.160 
the emulator menus which is kind of
cumbersome<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:00.979> just<00:02:01.250> closed<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.520> from<00:02:01.820> here

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
cumbersome so I just closed it from here

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.559 
cumbersome so I just closed it from here
we'll<00:02:03.170> open<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.530> again

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569

emulation<00:02:31.689> seems<00:02:32.049> to<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> little<00:02:32.650> funky

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
emulation seems to be a little funky

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.640 
emulation seems to be a little funky
with<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:33.719> I'm<00:02:34.719> wondering<00:02:35.049> if<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.409> is<00:02:35.560> an

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
with this I'm wondering if this is an

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.020 
with this I'm wondering if this is an
error<00:02:35.920> or<00:02:36.159> something<00:02:36.639> that<00:02:36.760> needs<00:02:36.909> to<00:02:36.939> be

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
error or something that needs to be

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:56.140 
error or something that needs to be
fixed

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.520 

Oh<00:02:59.959> No<00:03:00.959> makes<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.890> good<00:03:02.069> little<00:03:02.690> game<00:03:03.690> pot<00:03:04.019> 14
