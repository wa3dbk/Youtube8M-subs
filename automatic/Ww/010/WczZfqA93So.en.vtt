00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.330 
the pieces and so I kind of took that
and<00:01:49.330> just<00:01:49.900> merged<00:01:50.260> into<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.040> modern

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
and just merged into more of a modern

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.370 
and just merged into more of a modern
design<00:01:51.880> there<00:01:52.600> was<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.750> challenge<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
design there was a challenge in the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.010 
design there was a challenge in the
asymmetry<00:01:54.210> there's<00:01:55.210> usually<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:55.990> find

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
asymmetry there's usually you can find

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.240 
asymmetry there's usually you can find
balance<00:01:56.409> on<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.640> symmetrical<00:01:58.240> bust<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.689> can<00:01:58.869> find

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
balance on a symmetrical bust I can find

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.560 
balance on a symmetrical bust I can find
where<00:02:00.250> both<00:02:00.490> shoulders<00:02:00.939> are<00:02:01.060> supposed<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.360> end

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
where both shoulders are supposed to end

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.649 
where both shoulders are supposed to end
where<00:02:02.049> where<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.650> bring<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.979> down<00:02:03.159> naturally

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
where where to bring it down naturally

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.030 
where where to bring it down naturally
this<00:02:04.659> doesn't<00:02:04.930> go<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.380> way<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.770> find

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
this doesn't go that way I have to find

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.550 
this doesn't go that way I have to find
where<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.460> can<00:02:06.700> make<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.150> silhouette<00:02:07.960> end<00:02:08.200> and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
where I can make the silhouette end and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.259 
where I can make the silhouette end and
still<00:02:09.159> find<00:02:09.429> structure<00:02:09.909> they'll<00:02:10.060> make<00:02:10.239> it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
still find structure they'll make it

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.600 
still find structure they'll make it
pleasing<00:02:10.750> from<00:02:10.959> 360<00:02:11.500> degrees<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.159> you<00:02:12.489> can

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
pleasing from 360 degrees and you can

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.190 
pleasing from 360 degrees and you can
see<00:02:12.730> where<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.909> negative<00:02:13.209> space<00:02:13.329> works<00:02:13.720> well

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
see where the negative space works well

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.350 
see where the negative space works well
as<00:02:14.470> well<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:15.250> me<00:02:15.549> as<00:02:15.640> an<00:02:15.730> artist<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.150> has<00:02:16.239> to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
as well for me as an artist that has to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.180 
as well for me as an artist that has to
have<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.569> balance<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.530> will<00:02:17.770> make<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> look

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
have that balance that will make it look

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.670 
have that balance that will make it look
good

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
good

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.830 
good
from<00:02:19.340> all<00:02:19.549> sides<00:02:19.879> I<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.480> think<00:02:20.599> it's<00:02:20.780> a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
from all sides I just think it's a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.300 
from all sides I just think it's a
really<00:02:21.049> striking<00:02:21.379> piece<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.859> look<00:02:21.980> at<00:02:22.129> not

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
really striking piece to look at not

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.220 
really striking piece to look at not
just<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.579> portrait<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> whole<00:02:23.719> style<00:02:24.049> of

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
just the portrait but the whole style of

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.050 
just the portrait but the whole style of
the<00:02:24.319> bus<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.829> just<00:02:25.099> really<00:02:25.519> exciting<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the bus is just really exciting and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.399 
the bus is just really exciting and
appealing<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.629> eye<00:02:26.659> and<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:27.140> hope<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
appealing to the eye and I hope the

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.370 
appealing to the eye and I hope the
collectors<00:02:27.769> really<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.159> it
