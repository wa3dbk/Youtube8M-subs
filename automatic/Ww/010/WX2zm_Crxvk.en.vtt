of<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.399> pizzas<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:04.849> think<00:02:05.060> they're<00:02:05.209> using

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
of the pizzas but I think they're using

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.830 
of the pizzas but I think they're using
too<00:02:05.689> much<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.049> really<00:02:06.319> need<00:02:06.950> very<00:02:07.310> little<00:02:07.840> on

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
too much you really need very little on

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.510 
too much you really need very little on
the<00:02:09.050> other<00:02:09.200> hand<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.590> has<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.890> be<00:02:10.039> everywhere

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
the other hand it has to be everywhere

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.559 
the other hand it has to be everywhere
it<00:02:10.700> has<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:11.030> completely<00:02:11.569> coat<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.470> peel

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
it has to completely coat the peel

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.840 
it has to completely coat the peel
before<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.660> move<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.900> let's<00:02:15.110> talk<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.380> heat

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
before you move on let's talk about heat

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.120 
before you move on let's talk about heat
the<00:02:16.850> thing<00:02:17.000> about<00:02:17.240> pizza<00:02:17.990> at<00:02:18.110> home<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.680> why<00:02:19.070> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
the thing about pizza at home and why it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.070 
the thing about pizza at home and why it
almost<00:02:19.460> never<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:19.970> tastes<00:02:20.330> right<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
almost never really tastes right is that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.420 
almost never really tastes right is that
our<00:02:21.320> ovens<00:02:21.590> don't<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:21.950> hot<00:02:22.130> enough

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
our ovens don't get hot enough

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.310 
our ovens don't get hot enough
commercial<00:02:22.910> pizza<00:02:23.210> ovens<00:02:23.510> go<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:24.140> a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
commercial pizza ovens go to like a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.670 
commercial pizza ovens go to like a
thousand<00:02:24.920> degrees<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:27.290> way<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.560> get

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
thousand degrees so the way we get

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.440 
thousand degrees so the way we get
around<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.550> couple<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.030> strategies

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
around this is a couple of strategies

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.600 
around this is a couple of strategies
first<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.960> use<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> pizza<00:02:30.410> stone<00:02:30.710> which<00:02:31.010> go

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
first we use a pizza stone which go

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.830 
first we use a pizza stone which go
ahead<00:02:31.730> have<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.970> look<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.240> our<00:02:32.330> feats<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.600> stone

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
ahead have a look at our feats of stone

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.610 
ahead have a look at our feats of stone
a<00:02:33.260> little<00:02:34.870> dirty<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:36.170> that's<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.470> happy

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
a little dirty but that's what happy

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.500 
a little dirty but that's what happy
good<00:02:37.070> use<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.980> that's<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.580> know<00:02:40.640> absorbs<00:02:41.300> heat

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
good use so that's you know absorbs heat

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.080 
good use so that's you know absorbs heat
and<00:02:41.690> also<00:02:42.050> wicks<00:02:42.260> away<00:02:42.380> moisture<00:02:42.820> very<00:02:43.820> good

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
and also wicks away moisture very good

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.120 
and also wicks away moisture very good

and we're going to let the broiler kind

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.179 
and we're going to let the broiler kind
of<00:03:04.599> heat<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.989> surface<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.680> stone<00:03:05.890> sauce

around this problem and I thought about

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.220 
around this problem and I thought about
doing<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.970> but<00:03:58.150> they<00:03:58.329> don't<00:03:58.569> do<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.019> they

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
doing that but they don't do that they

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.099 
doing that but they don't do that they
say<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.799> know<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.310> trick<00:04:00.609> really<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:01.109> just

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
say you know the trick really is just

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.809 
say you know the trick really is just
use<00:04:02.290> mozzarella<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.129> flavor<00:04:03.370> comes<00:04:03.699> from

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
use mozzarella and the flavor comes from

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.460 
use mozzarella and the flavor comes from
the<00:04:04.090> Browning<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.780> get<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.230> cheese

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
the Browning that you get on the cheese

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.110 
the Browning that you get on the cheese
it<00:04:05.799> occurred<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.250> me<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.609> might<00:04:06.849> have<00:04:06.879> been

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
it occurred to me that I might have been

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.210 
it occurred to me that I might have been
under<00:04:07.269> baking<00:04:07.750> my<00:04:07.900> pizza<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.260> little<00:04:08.440> bit<00:04:08.739> so

under baking my pizza a little bit so
I'm<00:04:09.549> going<00:04:09.669> to<00:04:09.730> go<00:04:09.819> ahead<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.389> try<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.959> rely<00:04:11.260> on

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
I'm going to go ahead and try to rely on

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.869 
I'm going to go ahead and try to rely on
the<00:04:11.500> heat<00:04:11.709> from<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.010> oven<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.489> broiler

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
the heat from the oven and the broiler

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.240 
the heat from the oven and the broiler
to<00:04:12.910> just<00:04:13.239> brown<00:04:13.599> this<00:04:13.870> mozzarella<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.799> get<00:04:15.160> us

does<00:04:25.270> it's<00:04:25.570> like<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.780> laser<00:04:26.050> pointer<00:04:26.430> except<00:04:27.430> it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
does it's like a laser pointer except it

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.850 
does it's like a laser pointer except it
sees<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.910> heat<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.360> wall<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:29.080> seventy

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860

give it a shot and set the oven back to
its<00:04:45.300> oven<00:04:45.599> temperature<00:04:46.909> pick<00:04:47.909> up<00:04:48.029> your<00:04:48.149> peel

its oven temperature pick up your peel
and<00:04:48.629> you<00:04:48.689> got<00:04:48.809> a<00:04:48.839> little<00:04:49.050> loose<00:04:49.110> in<00:04:49.319> it<00:04:49.409> because

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:49.589 
and you got a little loose in it because

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:50.659 
and you got a little loose in it because
it's<00:04:49.709> been<00:04:49.830> sitting<00:04:50.129> there<00:04:50.159> as<00:04:50.369> we've<00:04:50.490> been

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
it's been sitting there as we've been

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.339 
it's been sitting there as we've been
dressing<00:04:50.909> the<00:04:51.179> pizza<00:04:51.509> it's<00:04:51.689> sort<00:04:51.869> of<00:04:51.899> bonded

dressing the pizza it's sort of bonded

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.049 
dressing the pizza it's sort of bonded
to<00:04:52.469> the<00:04:52.559> wood<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.770> little<00:04:53.069> bit<00:04:53.249> so<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:53.759> give<00:04:53.939> it

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:54.059 
to the wood a little bit so you give it

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.549 
to the wood a little bit so you give it
a<00:04:54.119> little<00:04:54.389> shake<00:04:55.309> just<00:04:56.309> to<00:04:56.429> release<00:04:56.729> it<00:04:57.259> and<00:04:58.259> we

00:04:58.549 --> 00:04:58.559 
a little shake just to release it and we

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:07.309 
a little shake just to release it and we
go<00:04:58.679> out<00:04:58.830> here<00:04:59.039> and<00:05:03.110> there<00:05:04.110> should<00:05:04.259> be<00:05:06.319> we'll

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
go out here and there should be we'll

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.279 
go out here and there should be we'll
come<00:05:07.469> back<00:05:07.679> in<00:05:07.830> like<00:05:08.039> five<00:05:08.339> six<00:05:08.610> seven<00:05:08.879> minutes

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
come back in like five six seven minutes

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.570 
come back in like five six seven minutes
so<00:05:10.289> I'm<00:05:10.619> not<00:05:10.740> sure<00:05:10.800> where<00:05:11.069> we're<00:05:11.189> at<00:05:11.249> with<00:05:11.459> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
so I'm not sure where we're at with the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.070 
so I'm not sure where we're at with the
baking<00:05:11.879> process<00:05:12.029> at<00:05:12.419> this<00:05:12.539> point<00:05:12.659> I<00:05:12.899> want<00:05:13.050> to

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
baking process at this point I want to

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.899 
baking process at this point I want to
check<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.529> bottom<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:14.069> see<00:05:14.219> how<00:05:14.369> Brown<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:14.789> is

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
check the bottom to see how Brown it is

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.949 
check the bottom to see how Brown it is
so<00:05:15.089> let's<00:05:15.240> check<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.509> out<00:05:17.809> looking<00:05:18.809> lovely

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:20.959 
so let's check it out looking lovely

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.549 
so let's check it out looking lovely
quite<00:05:21.959> Brown<00:05:22.229> on<00:05:22.469> the<00:05:22.589> bottom<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:24.469> find<00:05:25.469> that

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:25.559 
quite Brown on the bottom I find that

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.040 
quite Brown on the bottom I find that
the<00:05:25.649> pizza<00:05:25.919> gets<00:05:26.309> softer<00:05:26.909> as<00:05:27.149> it<00:05:27.389> sits<00:05:27.809> and

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
the pizza gets softer as it sits and

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.389 
the pizza gets softer as it sits and
cools<00:05:28.349> out<00:05:28.679> of<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.949> oven

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:29.399 
cools out of the oven

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.219 
cools out of the oven
I<00:05:29.429> assume<00:05:29.969> that's<00:05:30.179> because<00:05:30.240> it's<00:05:30.719> absorbing

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
I assume that's because it's absorbing

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.600 
I assume that's because it's absorbing
the<00:05:31.469> steam<00:05:31.800> from<00:05:32.069> all<00:05:32.249> of<00:05:32.369> the<00:05:32.490> other

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
the steam from all of the other

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.570 
the steam from all of the other
ingredients<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:33.869> I<00:05:34.169> feel<00:05:34.469> like<00:05:34.679> if<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:35.129> feels<00:05:35.399> a

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
ingredients so I feel like if it feels a

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.459 
ingredients so I feel like if it feels a
little<00:05:35.699> too<00:05:35.999> hard<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.449> little<00:05:36.659> too<00:05:36.839> crispy<00:05:37.110> in

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
little too hard a little too crispy in

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.559 
little too hard a little too crispy in
the<00:05:37.499> oven<00:05:37.619> then<00:05:38.459> it's<00:05:38.610> right<00:05:38.819> and<00:05:39.029> it's<00:05:39.389> about

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
the oven then it's right and it's about

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.999 
the oven then it's right and it's about
there<00:05:39.990> so<00:05:40.169> I'm<00:05:40.259> going<00:05:40.379> to<00:05:40.439> go<00:05:40.589> ahead<00:05:40.769> and<00:05:40.889> pull

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
there so I'm going to go ahead and pull

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:51.810 
there so I'm going to go ahead and pull
this

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:06:00.330
