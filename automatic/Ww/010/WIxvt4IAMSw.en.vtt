00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and welcome to a new art video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 visual today we are here in the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 home of the visual art guys of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.679
 channel if you do not know your big base in the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.469
 description of the video will be the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.549
 channel of them and today the video runs by 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.549
 account of them 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.060
 and do it 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:34.210
 as well 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.210
 and we need a lot of patience 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.780
 there are others also tapatÃ­a look at you 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.290
 and then we go against the craft 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.290
 everyone 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.809
 for this origami we will use 8 modules of 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.550
 10 x 10 centimeters can be 4 reds and 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.500
 4 yellows to build this star 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.570
 transformable we will do the following 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.199
 we will take the first module in half 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.979
 A) Yes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.979
 then we will fold the other half like this 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.300
 open we turn everything 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 well and we will mark the diagonals of this 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.600
 way 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 first we open and the other diagonal 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.759
 we open all this we turn and we close 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.759
 this way 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.430
 what we would do now would be to carry this 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.960
 line to the center like this 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.960
 the same thing we will do on this side 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.600
 Now we turn and do the same 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 and this will be our module that simple 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.310
 of course then we will have to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.110
 have other modules to be able to join them 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 go forming the star 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.280
 we have this yellow we want then 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.090
 to join them let's turn one of these 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.270
 way and we're going to introduce these two 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.950
 front points in these two spaces 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.569
 also forward in the module 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.290
 then we open it out a little 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 and we put this tip forward here and 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.969
 we try to put the other end in the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.049
 another space there and we close the idea is 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.330
 close until these corners get stuck 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.660
 closing 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.070
 and we are saving until I stop at the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.070
 tips we want now will double everything 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.370
 this is going to double everything and bring this 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.980
 tip to here the idea is that the fold 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.630
 that from here the center we talk about everything 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.970
 we achieve everything so we mark it well and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.910
 here we have a first part of 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.980
 our star then to put 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.250
 another module we do the same process 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.000
 this module would be the other way around and we will join 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.190
 the front pieces of each module ok 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 you are with those we will introduce there 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.110
 we introduce here and we begin to close 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.120
 until they plug those corners when 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.930
 there's so much game we're going to double this 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.930
 tip to here 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.290
 king 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.360
 and we close ok so you answer leave the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.060
 space of a single module and I'll show you 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.670
 how all this closes then we 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.770
 it is necessary to insert the last module that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.660
 course it is placed just like all 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.360
 points forward with the tips of 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.580
 forward of this and we began to join them 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.030
 until these two points are together 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.480
 or tighten up we just fold all 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.120
 and join the tips 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 you are going to unite well let's cover well 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.670
 everything and now I just want to join these 2 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.670
 there 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.590
 to put them together and of course you have to 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.639
 have the same fold here we put everything 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.340
 that we tighten well 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.650
 and we would already have the figure 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.229
 complete now how it works good little 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.169
 little by little they begin to open little by little 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.319
 take notice that they keep turning 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.289
 is going to form some figures automatically 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:38.710
 come there they have it is a figure like 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.110
 round that is endless uses spinning 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.370
 and there that the star is the star 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.250
 the tour again if they want 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.320
 that way the circle is impressive 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.550
 as a circle it is harmless but as 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.160
 star is lethal simple simple and so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.990
 form this magical star star 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.210
 magical ninja or whatever you want to call it 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.280
 you can keep playing with this I hope 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.280
 have you liked this new origami 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.669
 that's all that's how easy it becomes 

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:30.929
 when they do red average stars 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:30.929
 Of course it is transformable 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.910
 and good many thanks guys 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:41.150
 thanks for the door of your house thanks 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.150
 by 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.770
 remember that if you want to see change as 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.770
 this 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.509
 ah 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.050
 ah 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.320
 Y 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.409
