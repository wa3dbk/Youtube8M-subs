00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.969
 if you would employ people like Willem 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.449

 the municipality of utrecht and there i am 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.200
 project manager for the neighborhood teams and 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.670
 neighborhood teams are teams in which people 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.310
 sit with a different one 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.680
 box background but that now each as 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.200
 china list are going to work as workers 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.510
 those problems in multiple areas of life 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.579
 tackle the municipality of utrecht themselves 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.920
 started working together with amerpoort 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.870
 then it became clear that there was in 2015 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.189
 all kinds of new tasks to us 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.659
 happen to me 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.939
 amerpoort always has a very active one 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.760
 contributed to the utrechtse 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.870
 approach, caring itself is also one of them 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.730
 the neighborhood teams 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.650
 we also learned from amerpoort to 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.629
 with people with disabilities there 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.760
 gain more knowledge of it for people 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.349
 with intellectual disability 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.430
 the neighborhood teams means that they are close by 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.069
 House 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.169
 receive help in multiple areas of life 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.389
 that they will look with him 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.549
 what can you do yourself what can people do? 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.780
 from neighbors or family friends for you 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.250
 mean 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.260
 and if there are no options there 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.540
 then they remain the professional help 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.430

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.320
 already a bit myself but that is my way 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.180

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.669
 cycling from here if you want the 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:05.819
 telephone we email with the guidance 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.889

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.680
 assist in thinking along with 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.710
 throughout the whole process you just know 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.950
 not how things are going in the future 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.940
 with your health and so that you do not 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:29.100
