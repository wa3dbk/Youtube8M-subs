as you know I've been trying to reach to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.570 
as you know I've been trying to reach to
lofty<00:01:22.600> heights<00:01:23.080> with<00:01:23.440> my<00:01:23.650> marble<00:01:24.370> madness

for<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:38.610> lift<00:01:39.610> mechanism<00:01:39.820> I'm<00:01:40.420> going<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.630> use

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
for the lift mechanism I'm going to use

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.680 
for the lift mechanism I'm going to use
this<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:43.210> motor<00:01:43.540> for<00:01:43.990> tilting<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:45.190> board

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
this this motor for tilting the board

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.750 
this this motor for tilting the board
but<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:47.170> motor<00:01:48.040> just<00:01:48.280> didn't<00:01:48.580> have<00:01:48.730> enough

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
but that motor just didn't have enough

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.020 
but that motor just didn't have enough
um<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:50.050> let<00:01:50.230> me<00:01:50.350> get<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.770> marbles<00:01:51.670> up<00:01:51.790> in<00:01:51.910> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.510 

and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.840> rigged<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:20.310> just

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
and I rigged this up and it's just

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.540 
and I rigged this up and it's just
working<00:02:20.730> fine<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:24.320> wanted<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:26.070> say<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> couple

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
working fine I wanted to say a couple

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.270 
working fine I wanted to say a couple
things<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.470> particular<00:02:28.470> experiment

things about this particular experiment
first<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:32.480> relied<00:02:33.480> very<00:02:33.510> heavily<00:02:33.900> on

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
first of all I relied very heavily on

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.080 
first of all I relied very heavily on
Jurgen<00:02:37.280> kitchner<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.790> Germany<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.910> he<00:02:41.910> was

Jurgen kitchner of Germany and he was

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.160 
Jurgen kitchner of Germany and he was
the<00:02:42.270> inventor<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:43.020> mechanism<00:02:45.170> although

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
the inventor of this mechanism although

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.730 
the inventor of this mechanism although
I<00:02:46.380> didn't<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:47.900> schematic<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> CAD

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
I didn't have a schematic or a CAD

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.980 
I didn't have a schematic or a CAD
drawing<00:02:49.770> or<00:02:50.340> anything<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.150> did<00:02:51.780> see

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
drawing or anything like that I did see

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.980 
drawing or anything like that I did see
some<00:02:52.200> photos<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.800> think<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.190> did<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.990> faithful

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
some photos and I think I did a faithful

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.370 
some photos and I think I did a faithful
reproduction<00:02:55.710> based<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.700> what<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:56.940> saw<00:02:57.380> at

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
reproduction based on what I saw at

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.230 
reproduction based on what I saw at
least<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.770> mechanics<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.460> working<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> same

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
least the mechanics is working the same

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.820 
least the mechanics is working the same
as<00:03:00.480> his<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:02.850> methodology<00:03:06.650> one<00:03:07.650> other

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
as his of this methodology one other

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.630 
as his of this methodology one other
thing<00:03:08.280> about<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.790> mechanism<00:03:10.310> I'm<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.550> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
thing about the mechanism I'm going to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.440 
thing about the mechanism I'm going to
obviously<00:03:13.070> do<00:03:14.070> more<00:03:14.460> testing<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.210> and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
obviously do more testing on this and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.130 
obviously do more testing on this and
I'm<00:03:15.510> going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.690> raise<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> height<00:03:17.210> to<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.930> be

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
I'm going to raise the height to to be

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.630 
I'm going to raise the height to to be
about<00:03:20.270> here<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:22.800> got<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.070> go<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:23.310> quite<00:03:23.580> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
about here so it's got to go up quite a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.020 
about here so it's got to go up quite a
bit<00:03:23.880> more<00:03:24.410> but<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.440> wanted<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.920> report<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.940> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
bit more but I wanted to report to you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.140 
bit more but I wanted to report to you
that<00:03:27.060> I've<00:03:27.300> been<00:03:27.450> successful<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
that I've been successful in the the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.510 
that I've been successful in the the
marble<00:03:30.480> pump<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.350> mechanics<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.190> pump

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
marble pump the mechanics of the pump

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.900 
marble pump the mechanics of the pump
works<00:03:32.820> fine<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.510> did<00:03:34.410> decide<00:03:34.770> I<00:03:34.830> needed<00:03:35.340> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
works fine I did decide I needed to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.180 
works fine I did decide I needed to
build<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.270> two<00:03:37.370> two<00:03:38.370> gears<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:39.510> torque

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
build with two two gears to torque

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.080 
build with two two gears to torque
mechanism<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.730> put<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.239> gear<00:03:42.510> assembly<00:03:42.870> in

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
mechanism so I put this gear assembly in

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.199 
mechanism so I put this gear assembly in
and<00:03:44.660> then<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.650> decided<00:03:46.069> on<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.520> Technic<00:03:46.940> motor

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
and then I decided on the Technic motor

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.640 
and then I decided on the Technic motor
to<00:03:47.959> drive<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:50.650> marbles<00:03:51.650> are<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:53.020> funny<00:03:54.020> one

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
to drive it marbles are a funny one

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.670 
to drive it marbles are a funny one
I<00:03:55.090> ordered<00:03:56.090> my<00:03:56.239> marbles<00:03:56.750> when<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.230> built<00:03:57.560> this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
I ordered my marbles when I built this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.559 
I ordered my marbles when I built this
machine<00:03:58.120> my<00:03:59.120> marble<00:03:59.510> contraptions<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:01.569> they

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
machine my marble contraptions and they

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.640 
machine my marble contraptions and they
come<00:04:02.810> in<00:04:02.930> all<00:04:03.050> sizes

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
come in all sizes

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.500 
come in all sizes
you'd<00:04:03.890> think<00:04:04.069> they'd<00:04:04.310> all<00:04:04.459> be<00:04:04.700> uniformly<00:04:05.300> the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
you'd think they'd all be uniformly the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.770 
you'd think they'd all be uniformly the
same<00:04:05.720> size<00:04:06.019> but<00:04:06.290> that's<00:04:06.530> not<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.890> case

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
same size but that's not the case

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.110 
same size but that's not the case
they're<00:04:08.780> all<00:04:08.959> different<00:04:09.200> sizes<00:04:09.819> so<00:04:10.819> you<00:04:10.880> have

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
they're all different sizes so you have

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.660 
they're all different sizes so you have
to<00:04:11.239> be<00:04:11.390> very<00:04:11.690> particular<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:12.380> what<00:04:12.920> marbles

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
to be very particular about what marbles

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.130 
to be very particular about what marbles
you<00:04:13.730> use<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.209> here<00:04:14.360> otherwise<00:04:14.630> they'll<00:04:15.019> get

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
you use in here otherwise they'll get

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.879 
you use in here otherwise they'll get
stuck<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:17.840> built<00:04:18.139> myself<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.620> little

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
stuck so I built myself a little

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.770 
stuck so I built myself a little
template<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:20.359> ensure<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:23.060> marbles<00:04:23.540> will

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
template to ensure that the marbles will

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.070 
template to ensure that the marbles will
fit<00:04:24.410> in<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:25.010> mechanism<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:25.850> would<00:04:26.840> fully

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
fit in this mechanism I would fully

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.409 
fit in this mechanism I would fully
recommend<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.919> you<00:04:28.100> test<00:04:28.460> each<00:04:29.000> marble

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
recommend that you test each marble

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.790 
recommend that you test each marble
through<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.990> mechanism<00:04:30.620> itself<00:04:32.800> before

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
through the mechanism itself before

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.710 
through the mechanism itself before
putting<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.900> bucket<00:04:36.110> for<00:04:37.600> for<00:04:38.600> your

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
putting it in the bucket for for your

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.280 
putting it in the bucket for for your
marbles<00:04:39.110> because<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.500> don't<00:04:39.710> want<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.950> have<00:04:40.100> a

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
marbles because you don't want to have a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.719 
marbles because you don't want to have a
catastrophe<00:04:42.290> jam<00:04:42.590> because<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
catastrophe jam because if you have the

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.120 
catastrophe jam because if you have the
test<00:04:43.970> reagent<00:04:44.450> with<00:04:44.600> one<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.900> these<00:04:45.050> things<00:04:45.290> it

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
test reagent with one of these things it

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.330 
test reagent with one of these things it
blows<00:04:46.520> apart

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
blows apart

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.180 
blows apart
I<00:04:48.430> haven't<00:04:49.240> done<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.419> yet<00:04:49.600> but<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.080> can<00:04:50.889> assume

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
I haven't done it yet but I can assume

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.340 
I haven't done it yet but I can assume
that<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.550> would<00:04:51.699> probably<00:04:52.169> scattered<00:04:53.169> a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
that it would probably scattered a

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.930 
that it would probably scattered a
zillion<00:04:54.330> direction<00:04:55.330> I<00:04:59.160> want<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.220> say<00:05:00.370> one

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
zillion direction I want to say one

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.270 
zillion direction I want to say one
other<00:05:01.090> thing<00:05:01.270> about<00:05:01.740> creativity<00:05:02.740> I've<00:05:03.130> been

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
other thing about creativity I've been

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.969 
other thing about creativity I've been
trying<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.150> teach<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.600> guys<00:05:04.630> how<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.770> be

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
trying to teach you guys how to be

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.790 
trying to teach you guys how to be
creative<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:08.080> designed<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:09.479> kilt<00:05:10.800> mechanism

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
creative and I designed a kilt mechanism

I called Marvel badness and I've been
working<00:05:13.660> my<00:05:13.900> way<00:05:13.930> through<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:15.340> process

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
working my way through the the process

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.070 
working my way through the the process
of<00:05:16.030> design<00:05:16.419> and<00:05:16.720> I've<00:05:16.840> obviously<00:05:17.380> used<00:05:19.080> the

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
of design and I've obviously used the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.760 
of design and I've obviously used the
Juergen<00:05:20.500> kitcheners<00:05:21.010> design<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:22.770> other

don't be afraid to use ideas from other

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.980 
don't be afraid to use ideas from other
people<00:05:29.020> that's<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.370> essence<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.590> of

people that's the essence of of
creativity<00:05:34.990> is<00:05:35.139> using<00:05:35.669> everything<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.820> can

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
creativity is using everything you can

creativity is using everything you can
to<00:05:37.540> make<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.720> work<00:05:38.940> as<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:40.000> matter<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.360> fact<00:05:40.600> like

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
to make it work as a matter of fact like

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.990 
to make it work as a matter of fact like
I<00:05:41.340> have<00:05:42.340> this<00:05:43.210> is<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:45.250> things<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:45.760> read

and I you know I wade through this each

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.450 
and I you know I wade through this each
night<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:55.210> this<00:05:55.690> is<00:05:55.810> my<00:05:55.960> bedtime<00:05:56.500> we're<00:05:57.070> eating

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
night so this is my bedtime we're eating

night so this is my bedtime we're eating
and<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:59.080> get<00:05:59.260> ideas<00:05:59.440> from<00:06:01.050> people<00:06:02.050> that<00:06:02.200> have

and you get ideas from people that have
been<00:06:02.470> there<00:06:02.710> before<00:06:04.229> I<00:06:05.229> don't<00:06:05.650> think<00:06:05.979> that<00:06:06.130> I

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
been there before I don't think that I

been there before I don't think that I
would<00:06:06.310> have<00:06:06.520> been<00:06:06.639> able<00:06:06.789> to<00:06:06.880> do<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.270> lift

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
would have been able to do the lift

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.270 
would have been able to do the lift
mechanism<00:06:08.370> at<00:06:09.370> all<00:06:09.630> efficiently<00:06:10.630> with<00:06:10.780> this

and<00:06:17.400> there's<00:06:17.640> probably<00:06:17.910> more<00:06:18.120> than<00:06:18.180> one

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360
