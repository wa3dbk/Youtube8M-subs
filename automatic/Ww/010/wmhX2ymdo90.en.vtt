rigid foam insulation lying around my

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189

shop<00:00:26.249> for<00:00:26.519> quite<00:00:26.730> some<00:00:26.999> time<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.990> been

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
shop for quite some time it's been

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.540

around<00:00:28.409> for<00:00:28.679> so<00:00:28.710> long<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.310> kind<00:00:29.489> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
around for so long that it kind of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
around for so long that it kind of
turned<00:00:29.759> itself<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.390> shelf<00:00:30.749> I<00:00:30.989> figured<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
turned itself into a shelf I figured I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.540 
turned itself into a shelf I figured I
would<00:00:31.679> put<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.100> good<00:00:32.190> use

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
would put it to good use

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
would put it to good use
you<00:00:33.060> can<00:00:33.180> start<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.570> by<00:00:33.600> getting<00:00:33.780> some

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you can start off by getting some

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.870 
you can start off by getting some
measurements<00:00:34.650> of<00:00:34.740> your<00:00:34.860> garage<00:00:35.040> door<00:00:35.130> panels

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
measurements of your garage door panels

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.910 
measurements of your garage door panels
then<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.810> move<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.140> cutting<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.590> foam

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
then you can move on to cutting the foam

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
then you can move on to cutting the foam
there's<00:00:38.430> numerous<00:00:38.670> ways<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.270> which<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.540> can

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
there's numerous ways in which you can

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.510 
there's numerous ways in which you can
cut<00:00:39.810> the<00:00:39.960> phone<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.440> employed<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.340> about

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
cut the phone I employed just about

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
cut the phone I employed just about
every<00:00:41.880> method<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.540> which<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.870> was

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
every method to see which way was

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.280 
every method to see which way was
quickest<00:00:44.420> trying<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> draw<00:00:45.720> straight<00:00:46.050> lines

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
quickest trying to draw straight lines

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.080 
quickest trying to draw straight lines
with<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:46.500> speed<00:00:46.830> square<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:47.580> I<00:00:47.610> realized

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
with a speed square and then I realized

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420 
with a speed square and then I realized
that<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.480> had<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> drywall<00:00:49.080> t-square<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.400> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that I had a drywall t-square so I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.370 
that I had a drywall t-square so I
figured<00:00:50.760> why<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:50.940> use<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.750> sharp<00:00:52.200> knife

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
figured why not use that a sharp knife

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.780 
figured why not use that a sharp knife
makes<00:00:52.680> cutting<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.130> foam<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> whole<00:00:53.610> lot

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
makes cutting the foam a whole lot

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.240 
makes cutting the foam a whole lot
easier<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.720> use<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.800> circular

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
easier you can use that or a circular

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.210 
easier you can use that or a circular
saw<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.880> jigsaw<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.630> your<00:00:58.140> bare<00:00:58.320> hands<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.130> I

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
saw a jigsaw or your bare hands but I

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.040 
saw a jigsaw or your bare hands but I
suspect<00:00:59.670> you'd<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.970> better<00:01:00.120> results<00:01:00.750> using

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
suspect you'd get better results using

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
suspect you'd get better results using
some<00:01:01.350> tools<00:01:01.620> however<00:01:02.490> you<00:01:02.610> decide<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> go

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
some tools however you decide to go

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
some tools however you decide to go
about<00:01:03.450> it<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.289> make<00:01:04.469> your<00:01:04.530> pieces<00:01:05.039> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
about it you can now make your pieces to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.410 
about it you can now make your pieces to
the<00:01:05.280> sizes<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.939> measured<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.329> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the sizes that you measured on the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
the sizes that you measured on the
garage<00:01:06.570> door<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.170> quickly<00:01:07.710> discovered<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.310> my

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
garage door I quickly discovered that my

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.099 
garage door I quickly discovered that my
pieces<00:01:08.969> of<00:01:09.090> foam<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.719> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:09.929> bit

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
pieces of foam were just a little bit

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.319 
pieces of foam were just a little bit
too<00:01:10.289> thick<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.590> my<00:01:10.859> garage<00:01:11.100> door<00:01:11.159> panels<00:01:11.820> my

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
too thick for my garage door panels my

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.239 
too thick for my garage door panels my
rigid<00:01:12.689> foam<00:01:12.869> insulation<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.649> two<00:01:13.890> inches

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
rigid foam insulation was two inches

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:16.279 
rigid foam insulation was two inches
thick<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.119> inside<00:01:15.479> dimension<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.109> garage

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
thick the inside dimension of my garage

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.440 
thick the inside dimension of my garage
door<00:01:16.710> panels<00:01:17.069> was<00:01:17.219> roughly<00:01:17.520> 1<00:01:17.819> and<00:01:17.969> 3/4<00:01:18.420> inches

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
door panels was roughly 1 and 3/4 inches

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690 
door panels was roughly 1 and 3/4 inches
thick<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.259> figured<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.100> router<00:01:20.310> would<00:01:20.549> make

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
thick I figured a router would make

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
thick I figured a router would make
quick<00:01:20.969> work<00:01:20.999> with<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> rabbeting<00:01:22.079> bit<00:01:22.109> so<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
quick work with a rabbeting bit so that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.989 
quick work with a rabbeting bit so that
I<00:01:22.740> could<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.039> wrap<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.490> about<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> quarter

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
I could just wrap it about a quarter

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.300 
I could just wrap it about a quarter
inch<00:01:24.179> on<00:01:24.630> each<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.289> edges<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.859> panels

my garage door panels was actually a
little<00:01:39.359> bit<00:01:39.509> wider<00:01:39.780> than<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.319> bottoms<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.009> my

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
little bit wider than the bottoms so my

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.279 
little bit wider than the bottoms so my
plan<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.819> once<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.359> rabbits<00:01:42.719> were<00:01:42.840> cut<00:01:43.109> in

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
plan was once the rabbits were cut in

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.499 
plan was once the rabbits were cut in
the<00:01:43.409> pieces<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.889> foam<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.999> then<00:01:45.119> slide

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the pieces of foam I would then slide

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
the pieces of foam I would then slide
the<00:01:45.719> foam<00:01:45.929> pieces<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.069> garage<00:01:47.189> door

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the foam pieces into the garage door

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.910 
the foam pieces into the garage door
panel<00:01:47.939> rotate<00:01:48.569> it<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.780> place<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.319> then<00:01:49.619> slide

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
panel rotate it in place and then slide

it<00:01:50.039> down<00:01:50.159> evening<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:50.969> gap<00:01:51.209> I<00:01:51.450> wanted<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it down evening out the gap I wanted to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.629 
it down evening out the gap I wanted to
ensure<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.289> my<00:01:52.560> panels<00:01:52.950> were<00:01:53.039> as<00:01:53.159> tight<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
ensure that my panels were as tight as I

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.459 
ensure that my panels were as tight as I
could<00:01:53.700> possibly<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.689> making<00:01:54.990> certain

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
could possibly get them making certain

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:56.809 
could possibly get them making certain
that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> didn't<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.279> use<00:01:56.399> any<00:01:56.549> type<00:01:56.789> of

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
that I didn't have to use any type of

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.789 
that I didn't have to use any type of
adhesive<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.569> keep<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> panels<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.229> place<00:01:58.289> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
adhesive to keep the panels in place it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
adhesive to keep the panels in place it
was<00:01:58.889> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.249> of<00:01:59.340> trial<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.759> error<00:01:59.880> on

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
was a little bit of trial and error on

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.669 
was a little bit of trial and error on
the<00:02:00.149> first<00:02:00.179> piece<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:00.929> once<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.200> got<00:02:01.319> that<00:02:01.499> one

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
the first piece but once I got that one

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.349 
the first piece but once I got that one
in<00:02:01.799> place<00:02:02.039> I<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.520> duplicate<00:02:03.149> any

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
in place I can then just duplicate any

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.429 
in place I can then just duplicate any
similar<00:02:03.840> sizes

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.650 

a<00:02:07.469> cross<00:02:08.369> member<00:02:08.610> needed<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.209> removed<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
a cross member needed to be removed to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
a cross member needed to be removed to
slide<00:02:09.899> my<00:02:10.050> bottom<00:02:10.380> pieces<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.190> was

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
slide my bottom pieces in but that was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.479 
slide my bottom pieces in but that was
quick<00:02:11.550> work<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.500> upper<00:02:13.800> panel<00:02:14.130> had<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.400> of

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
quick work the upper panel had one of

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.070 
quick work the upper panel had one of
those<00:02:14.550> cross<00:02:14.819> members<00:02:15.239> as<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.019> could

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
those cross members as well but I could

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.770 
those cross members as well but I could
actually<00:02:16.260> slide<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> foam<00:02:17.130> underneath<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
actually slide the foam underneath the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.360 
actually slide the foam underneath the
area<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.110> had<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.319> take<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:19.830> larger<00:02:20.220> than

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
area I had to take out was larger than

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.009 
area I had to take out was larger than
my<00:02:20.459> rabbit<00:02:20.849> fit<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.269> just<00:02:21.450> cut<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.750> portion

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
my rabbit fit so I just cut that portion

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.089 
my rabbit fit so I just cut that portion
by<00:02:22.319> hand<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:24.260> could<00:02:25.260> already<00:02:25.590> notice<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
by hand I could already notice the

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.320 
by hand I could already notice the
difference<00:02:26.430> standing<00:02:26.849> next<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
difference standing next to the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.790 
difference standing next to the
insulated<00:02:27.840> portion<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> garage<00:02:28.470> door

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
insulated portion of the garage door

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.370 
insulated portion of the garage door
versus<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> uninsulated<00:02:30.269> portion<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.290> you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
versus the uninsulated portion here you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.839 
versus the uninsulated portion here you
can<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> cheated<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.250> bit<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.640> have

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
can see I cheated a little bit I have

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.120 
can see I cheated a little bit I have
one<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.060> these<00:02:33.150> really<00:02:33.390> nice<00:02:33.660> pumping<00:02:34.380> suction

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
one of these really nice pumping suction

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.160 
one of these really nice pumping suction
cups<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> was<00:02:36.150> able<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.480> apply<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
cups so I was able to apply that to the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.660 
cups so I was able to apply that to the
foam<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.680> then<00:02:37.830> position<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.400> piece

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
foam and then position the piece

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.089 
foam and then position the piece

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.729 
the cold just radiating in and it just
didn't<00:03:12.690> make<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.900> very<00:03:13.079> comfortable<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.709> be

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
didn't make it very comfortable to be

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.250 
didn't make it very comfortable to be
around<00:03:13.880> now<00:03:14.880> with<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.329> foam<00:03:15.569> board<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:16.019> it's

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
around now with the foam board up it's

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.170 
around now with the foam board up it's
it's<00:03:16.560> warm<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.190> touch<00:03:17.280> where<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.730> foam<00:03:17.940> is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it's warm to the touch where the foam is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.150 
it's warm to the touch where the foam is
and<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.750> don't<00:03:18.930> feel<00:03:19.170> very<00:03:19.680> much<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.069> that

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and I don't feel very much of that

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.430 
and I don't feel very much of that
radiating<00:03:20.730> back<00:03:20.910> into<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.299> room<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.109> I

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
radiating back into the room so and I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.479 
radiating back into the room so and I
think<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:22.709> going<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:22.859> save<00:03:23.040> me<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> lot<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
think it's going to save me a lot of

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.920 
think it's going to save me a lot of
money<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> long<00:03:24.150> run<00:03:24.180> being<00:03:24.540> I'm<00:03:24.660> doing<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
money in the long run being I'm doing a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.300 
money in the long run being I'm doing a
lot<00:03:25.049> more<00:03:25.260> projects<00:03:25.859> out<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.160> cold

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
lot more projects out in the cold

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.770 
lot more projects out in the cold
weather<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.760> I'm<00:03:26.910> having<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.239> heat<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.540> shop

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

you<00:03:28.590> don't<00:03:28.739> necessarily<00:03:28.889> have<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.760> take<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
you don't necessarily have to take the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.720 
you don't necessarily have to take the
route<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.480> did<00:03:30.900> with<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.620> router<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.220> jamming

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
route I did with the router and jamming

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.280 
route I did with the router and jamming
it<00:03:32.819> up<00:03:32.910> into<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.239> channels<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:34.109> was

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
it up into the channels that was

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.229 
it up into the channels that was
definitely<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> lot<00:03:34.980> more<00:03:35.040> time-consuming<00:03:35.940> but

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
definitely a lot more time-consuming but

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.420 
definitely a lot more time-consuming but
I'm<00:03:36.660> kind<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.079> particular<00:03:37.230> how<00:03:37.859> I<00:03:37.889> do<00:03:38.040> things

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
I'm kind of particular how I do things

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.940 
I'm kind of particular how I do things
but<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.120> could<00:03:39.299> always<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:40.139> take<00:03:40.290> smaller

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
but you could always just take smaller

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.090 
but you could always just take smaller
pieces<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.810> cut<00:03:42.810> them<00:03:42.989> undersized<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
pieces and cut them undersized to the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.220 
pieces and cut them undersized to the
opening<00:03:44.609> maybe<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.910> quarter-inch<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.810> then

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
opening maybe a quarter-inch and then

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.080 
opening maybe a quarter-inch and then
just<00:03:46.440> glue<00:03:46.709> them<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:47.010> with<00:03:47.280> some<00:03:47.519> foam<00:03:47.819> board

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
just glue them on with some foam board

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640 
just glue them on with some foam board
adhesive<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:49.079> want<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.290> use<00:03:49.380> stuff

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
adhesive you want to use stuff

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.870 
adhesive you want to use stuff
specifically<00:03:50.430> designed<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.230> foam<00:03:52.230> board<00:03:52.530> or

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
specifically designed for foam board or

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.490 
specifically designed for foam board or
expanded<00:03:53.880> polystyrene<00:03:54.239> because<00:03:54.870> any<00:03:55.319> type<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
expanded polystyrene because any type of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.349 
expanded polystyrene because any type of
solvents<00:03:56.190> are<00:03:56.250> actually<00:03:56.579> going<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.910> eat<00:03:57.090> up

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
solvents are actually going to eat up

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.870 
solvents are actually going to eat up
the<00:03:57.720> insulation<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.549> just<00:03:59.760> won't

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the insulation and it just it just won't

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.809 
the insulation and it just it just won't
work<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:01.560> I'm<00:04:02.069> really<00:04:02.280> happy<00:04:02.489> how<00:04:02.700> it

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
work so but I'm really happy how it

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.089 
work so but I'm really happy how it
turned<00:04:03.030> out<00:04:03.150> I'll<00:04:03.389> most<00:04:03.720> likely<00:04:03.870> paint<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
turned out I'll most likely paint the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.670 
turned out I'll most likely paint the
inside<00:04:05.609> surface<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.329> foam<00:04:06.540> white<00:04:06.989> just

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
inside surface of the foam white just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.440 
inside surface of the foam white just
because<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.310> said<00:04:08.370> I'm<00:04:08.670> particular<00:04:09.299> how

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
because like I said I'm particular how

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.539 
because like I said I'm particular how
things<00:04:09.750> look<00:04:10.019> but<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.620> mean<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:10.980> fine<00:04:11.250> as<00:04:11.519> it

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
things look but I mean it's fine as it

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.430 
things look but I mean it's fine as it
is<00:04:11.849> it's<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.180> an<00:04:12.420> aesthetics<00:04:12.930> thing

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
is it's just an aesthetics thing

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.439 
is it's just an aesthetics thing
either<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.340> or<00:04:14.400> come<00:04:14.819> spring<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.329> was

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
either that or come spring I was

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.390 
either that or come spring I was
thinking<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.900> might<00:04:16.049> take<00:04:16.290> some<00:04:16.350> 8-inch<00:04:17.100> hard

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
thinking I might take some 8-inch hard

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.670 
thinking I might take some 8-inch hard
board<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.790> either<00:04:17.880> screw<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.479> or<00:04:18.690> rivet<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.560> to

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
board and either screw it or rivet it to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.539 
board and either screw it or rivet it to
the<00:04:19.769> each<00:04:19.889> of<00:04:19.919> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the each of the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.580 
the each of the
or<00:04:20.699> panels<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.690> way<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:22.019> even<00:04:22.139> put<00:04:22.409> some

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
or panels that way I can even put some

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.680 
or panels that way I can even put some
insulation<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.340> here<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.819> it<00:04:24.449> would<00:04:24.539> be<00:04:24.659> just

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
insulation in here and it would be just

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.180 
insulation in here and it would be just
that<00:04:24.990> much<00:04:25.139> better<00:04:25.379> and<00:04:25.620> then<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.800> hardboard

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
that much better and then the hardboard

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.920 
that much better and then the hardboard
would<00:04:26.370> be<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> lot<00:04:26.699> more<00:04:26.909> durable<00:04:27.300> than<00:04:27.690> than

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
would be a lot more durable than than

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.249 
would be a lot more durable than than
just<00:04:27.960> painted<00:04:28.860> foam<00:04:29.129> so<00:04:29.690> but<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.960> pretty

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
just painted foam so but that pretty

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.719 
just painted foam so but that pretty
much<00:04:31.349> wraps<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.800> up<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:31.919> me<00:04:32.190> for<00:04:32.220> this<00:04:32.520> week

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
much wraps it up for me for this week

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.670 
much wraps it up for me for this week
until<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.389> see<00:04:33.599> you<00:04:33.690> guys<00:04:33.780> next<00:04:34.050> time<00:04:34.229> have<00:04:34.620> a

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
until I see you guys next time have a

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.949 
until I see you guys next time have a
good<00:04:34.830> one
