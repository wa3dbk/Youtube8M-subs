the string firing the proximal moves
into<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> hand<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.719> really

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
into the hand and that's what you really

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
into the hand and that's what you really
have<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> remember<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> do

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
have to remember you don't want to do

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.139 
have to remember you don't want to do
this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149

this
proximal<00:00:58.109> moves<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> hand<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:04.070> I'm

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
proximal moves into the hand and I'm

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.300 
proximal moves into the hand and I'm
touching<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> string<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> fire<00:01:06.600> before

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
touching for the string so I fire before

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
touching for the string so I fire before
relax<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> finger<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.960> returns

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
relax the finger back and it returns

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
relax the finger back and it returns
back<00:01:10.619> over<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> string<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.030> we're<00:01:15.210> doing

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
back over the string so when we're doing

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
back over the string so when we're doing
the<00:01:15.540> 1<00:01:15.810> 2<00:01:16.110> 3<00:01:16.140> 4<00:01:17.009> 4<00:01:17.460> 3<00:01:17.490> 2<00:01:18.210> 1<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.409> finger<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.799> doing

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 the finger is doing

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.580 
the 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 the finger is doing
this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.609 

now<00:01:23.369> we'll<00:01:24.060> stop<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.840> free<00:01:25.259> stroke<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
now we'll stop with the free stroke and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
now we'll stop with the free stroke and
they<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> work<00:01:26.399> that<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.420> wanted

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they you want to work that and I wanted

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.060 
they you want to work that and I wanted
to<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:27.990> talk<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> second<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:28.860> about

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to actually talk for a second more about

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
to actually talk for a second more about
extreme<00:01:29.490> crossing<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> position<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.530> I'm

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
extreme crossing so this position if I'm

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
extreme crossing so this position if I'm
going<00:01:31.979> from<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> first<00:01:32.430> train<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> second

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
going from the first train to the second

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
going from the first train to the second
string<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.750> whole<00:01:33.930> part<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.289> end<00:01:34.500> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
string the whole part of the end this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609 
string the whole part of the end this
whole<00:01:34.979> function<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.820> moves<00:01:36.149> back<00:01:36.500> here<00:01:37.500> so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
whole function here moves back here so

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.529 
whole function here moves back here so
I'm<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> third<00:01:38.220> string<00:01:38.549> I'm

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
I'm gonna go to the third string I'm

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.359 
I'm gonna go to the third string I'm
moving<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.080> whole<00:01:40.320> hand<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.950> crossed<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
moving the whole hand for I crossed the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859 
moving the whole hand for I crossed the
streams<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> Spanish<00:01:42.240> tradition<00:01:42.450> which

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
streams in the Spanish tradition which

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
is the whole hand crosses not an elbow

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.359

across<00:01:48.470> this<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.039> maker

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
across this way you have the maker

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
across this way you have the maker
maintaining<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> exact<00:01:51.329> same<00:01:51.570> tone<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.950> if

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
maintaining the exact same tone so if

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710

the string exactly the same way that's
really<00:02:04.080> really<00:02:04.439> important<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.039> keep<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.429> same

you want to see see the small structures
moving<00:02:20.910> exactly<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.450> same<00:02:21.630> you're<00:02:21.810> not

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
moving exactly the same you're not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.080 
moving exactly the same you're not
reaching<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.470> strings<00:02:22.769> if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.580> reach<00:02:23.819> for<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
reaching for strings if you reach for a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.089 
reaching for strings if you reach for a
string<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.750> destabilizes<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.620> hand<00:02:25.830> number

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
string it destabilizes the hand number

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.120 
string it destabilizes the hand number
one<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> also<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:28.019> also<00:02:28.170> changes<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.950> tone

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
one but it also it also changes the tone

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.460 
one but it also it also changes the tone
now<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.390> are<00:02:30.480> times<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.870> we're<00:02:31.049> we're

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
now there are times that we're we're

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.740 
now there are times that we're we're
moving<00:02:31.920> forward<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.489> we<00:02:32.910> move<00:02:33.239> forward<00:02:33.420> we're

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
moving forward as we move forward we're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.690 
moving forward as we move forward we're
reaching<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.170> little<00:02:34.320> bit<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.769> string<00:02:35.040> but

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
reaching a little bit for the string but

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.620 
reaching a little bit for the string but
you<00:02:35.850> don't<00:02:36.000> want<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> maintain<00:02:36.299> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
you don't want to maintain the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.960 
you don't want to maintain the
metacarpal<00:02:37.109> here<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.220> reach<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
metacarpal here and then reach out to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.930 
metacarpal here and then reach out to
play<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.519> important

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
play so this is a really important

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.729 
play so this is a really important
string<00:02:45.180> string<00:02:45.600> exercise<00:02:46.140> notice<00:02:46.380> my<00:02:46.530> thumb

here's the thought the idea of the thumb

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.729 
here's the thought the idea of the thumb
the<00:02:54.810> thumb<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.409> make<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
the thumb this is going to make is

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.220 
the thumb this is going to make is
touching<00:02:56.189> break<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.579> edge<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.819> flesh<00:02:57.230> but

touching break the edge of the flesh but

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.199 
touching break the edge of the flesh but
it's<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.500> right<00:02:59.280> before<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.640> nail<00:02:59.760> touches

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
it's a right before the nail touches
