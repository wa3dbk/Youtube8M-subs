welcome<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.630> video<00:00:07.020> today<00:00:07.530> we're<00:00:07.800> going

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
welcome to this video today we're going

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.420 
welcome to this video today we're going
to<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.130> talking<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.570> thermo<00:00:09.570> regulation

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
to be talking about thermo regulation

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.360 
to be talking about thermo regulation
now<00:00:11.430> thermo<00:00:12.000> means<00:00:12.270> heat<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.070> regulation<00:00:14.070> is

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
now thermo means heat and regulation is

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.910 
now thermo means heat and regulation is
to<00:00:14.430> do<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.940> control<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.629> is<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.470> do<00:00:16.590> with<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to do with control of is to do with the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.730 
to do with control of is to do with the
control<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.460> body<00:00:17.610> temperature<00:00:18.530> because<00:00:19.530> body

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
control of body temperature because body

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.100 
control of body temperature because body
temperature<00:00:20.460> must<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.850> very<00:00:21.330> finely

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
temperature must be very finely

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.680 
temperature must be very finely
controlled<00:00:22.760> if<00:00:23.760> body<00:00:24.000> temperature<00:00:24.120> drops

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
controlled if body temperature drops

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
controlled if body temperature drops
down<00:00:24.930> too<00:00:25.200> much

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
down too much

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.640 
down too much
very<00:00:26.190> soon<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.640> had<00:00:26.790> problems<00:00:27.590> hypothermia

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
very soon we had problems hypothermia

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.700 
very soon we had problems hypothermia
low<00:00:29.010> body<00:00:29.340> temperature<00:00:29.940> in<00:00:30.930> body<00:00:31.140> temperature

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
low body temperature in body temperature

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.420 
low body temperature in body temperature
rises<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.850> soon<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.719> problems

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
rises very soon we get into problems

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.970 
rises very soon we get into problems
hyperthermia<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:36.570> need<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> fine<00:00:37.110> regulation

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
hyperthermia we need a fine regulation

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
hyperthermia we need a fine regulation
of<00:00:38.130> body<00:00:38.250> temperature<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.720> homeo<00:00:40.230> thermic

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
of body temperature we are homeo thermic

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.090 
of body temperature we are homeo thermic
organisms<00:00:42.770> now<00:00:43.940> why<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
organisms now why do you think it is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.150 
organisms now why do you think it is
that<00:00:47.100> body<00:00:47.340> temperature<00:00:48.060> needs<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.630> be<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
that body temperature needs to be so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800 
that body temperature needs to be so
finely<00:00:50.160> regulated<00:00:50.460> why<00:00:51.210> can't<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.600> work

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
finely regulated why can't we work

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.810 
finely regulated why can't we work
finally<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.440> temperature<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> 45<00:00:53.460> degrees

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
finally the temperature of 45 degrees

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.569 
finally the temperature of 45 degrees
centigrade<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.540> 25<00:00:55.079> degrees<00:00:55.410> centigrade

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.610 

well<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> probably<00:00:59.880> realized<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> key

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
well you probably realized that the key

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.780 
well you probably realized that the key
thing<00:01:01.950> is<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:03.140> enzymes<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.790> temperature

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
thing is that enzymes are temperature

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.499 
thing is that enzymes are temperature
specific<00:01:07.219> so<00:01:08.219> within<00:01:08.579> all<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.119> cells<00:01:09.329> of

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
specific so within all of the cells of

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.500 
specific so within all of the cells of
the<00:01:09.600> body<00:01:09.740> there<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.979> enzymes<00:01:11.510> which

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the body there are enzymes which

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.870 
the body there are enzymes which
catalyze<00:01:13.549> biochemical<00:01:14.549> reactions<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.670> any

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
catalyze biochemical reactions so in any

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
catalyze biochemical reactions so in any
cell<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> might<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.780> substance<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.500> for

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
cell you might have substance a for

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.020 
cell you might have substance a for
example<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> needs<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.070> chemically

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
example and that needs to be chemically

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.250 
example and that needs to be chemically
converting<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.840> substance<00:01:25.290> B<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.020> won't

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
converting to substance B now this won't

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.760 
converting to substance B now this won't
happen<00:01:28.440> on<00:01:28.799> its<00:01:28.950> own<00:01:30.290> there<00:01:31.290> must<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.530> an

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
happen on its own there must be an

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.690 
happen on its own there must be an
enzyme<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.580> catalyzes<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.479> reaction<00:01:37.700> for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
enzyme that catalyzes the reaction for

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.000 
enzyme that catalyzes the reaction for
example<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.330> enzyme<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.380> enzymes<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.830> all

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
example the enzyme the enzymes have all

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.420 
example the enzyme the enzymes have all
got<00:01:41.189> different<00:01:41.729> names<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.159> biochemical

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
got different names so all biochemical

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.789 
got different names so all biochemical
reactions<00:01:45.330> are<00:01:45.689> facilitated<00:01:46.500> by<00:01:46.850> enzymes<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
reactions are facilitated by enzymes and

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.609 
reactions are facilitated by enzymes and
enzymes<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:50.759> complicated<00:01:51.689> protein

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
enzymes are complicated protein

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.910 
enzymes are complicated protein
structures<00:01:53.659> they<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.750> complicated<00:01:55.140> proteins

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
structures they are complicated proteins

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.140 
structures they are complicated proteins
there<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.790> big<00:01:57.380> macromolecules<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.150> the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
there are big macromolecules and the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.090 
there are big macromolecules and the
configuration<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> enzyme<00:02:01.680> will

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
configuration of the enzyme will

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
configuration of the enzyme will
actually<00:02:02.579> alter<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.780> molecular

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
actually alter the molecular

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.109 
actually alter the molecular
architecture<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.400> environment<00:02:06.000> will

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
architecture of the environment will

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
architecture of the environment will
alter<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.290> temperature<00:02:07.740> alters<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
alter if the temperature alters the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.369 
alter if the temperature alters the
enzymes<00:02:11.129> work<00:02:11.610> optimally<00:02:11.939> at<00:02:12.689> normal<00:02:13.200> body

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
enzymes work optimally at normal body

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.190 
enzymes work optimally at normal body
temperature<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.360> shape<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.840> enzymes

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
temperature so the shape of the enzymes

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.800 
temperature so the shape of the enzymes
must<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.560> maintained<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.670> order<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.330> maintain

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
functionality of the enzymes must be

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.910 
functionality of the enzymes must be
maintained<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.469> maintain<00:02:25.980> our<00:02:26.310> biochemistry

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
maintained to maintain our biochemistry

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.860 
maintained to maintain our biochemistry
if<00:02:28.920> biochemistry<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.849> not<00:02:30.030> maintained<00:02:30.569> then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
if biochemistry is not maintained then

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.080 
if biochemistry is not maintained then
the<00:02:31.019> cells<00:02:31.260> will<00:02:31.469> not<00:02:31.500> work<00:02:31.829> properly<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the cells will not work properly the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.479 
the cells will not work properly the
tissues<00:02:33.569> which<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.109> cells<00:02:34.349> compose<00:02:35.099> will<00:02:35.370> not

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
tissues which the cells compose will not

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.849 
tissues which the cells compose will not
function<00:02:35.700> properly<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.500> organs<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.709> systems

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
function properly and organs and systems

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.649 
function properly and organs and systems
of<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.310> body<00:02:38.430> will<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.180> function<00:02:39.629> properly

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
of the body will not function properly

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.289 
of the body will not function properly
so<00:02:40.640> temperature<00:02:41.640> must<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.879> very<00:02:42.060> finely

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
so temperature must be very finely

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.949 
so temperature must be very finely
controlled<00:02:42.840> because<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.489> lead<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
controlled because of the lead for the
