00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:25.740
 hello everyone okay I'll clean them 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.830
 are the headlights of the car to be of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.989
 plastic material have been damaged 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.530
 quite and both one and the other are 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:42.270
 pretty ugly good I've protected all the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.480
 part that remains below the focus well 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.050
 I have some folds of sandpaper for water 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.450
 these blacks of grain 1000 and this one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.480
 of 1500 the gray one to start 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.970
 chopping 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.050
 one of them and with a little water 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.820
 clean putting the pieces 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.780
 in water and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.230
 giving him 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 in circles to what is 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.580
 the lighthouse the pit 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.400
 Well, this is all based on 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 patience 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 and to go fixing 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560
 or polishing with a finite sandpaper what 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 First 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.640
 what is everything 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.869
 the fox 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.869
 all 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.450
 well I'm already with the other one too 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 here the circles with this sandpaper is a 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.530
 little bit big 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.080
 and then with the other one it can be that 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.630
 we wait for Beijing 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.070
 but like very fine fine sandpaper 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.070
 neither leaves traces 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.739
 of scratch or nothing 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.030
 and well, once I was already 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.900
 polished with water and 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.450
 and the sandpaper of 1,000 with him 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.510
 food that I have liquid I made a 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.790
 little bit to the sandpaper 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.790
 and this 1500 is with which already 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.890
 and the last review 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.210
 and now as I did on the other I 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.000
 done a little bit of polish on the sandpaper 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.380
 finite 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.380
 in the 1500's 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.409
 and this one is going 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.409
 baby with a cloth 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.740
 You see what he is going to give and alan polished 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.010
 but with ali jatibi there is water 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.190
 the polish 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.500
 well now 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.550
 we give it a little bit of 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.550
 the polish 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.380
 It's obvious 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.380
 the transparency of polycarbonate 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.730
 of how he was how he's doing and there's 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.730
 different 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.690
 if we saw what's left 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.300
 a little regular or pulling bad 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.569
 then we repeat the operation from the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.269
 beginning right now 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.090
 but that is pretty passable but 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.120
 you still need to give it 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.310
 the drill and he 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.570
 and cotton 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.570
 what is the brightness said 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.780
 going through the different stages 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.970
 how was this after polishing it 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.169
 to take him 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.380
 and leave it dry 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.169
 well once the 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.750
 polish 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.729
 with the cotton in the drill 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.430
 there 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.159
 several ways of doing it with the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.849
 accessories that I put to the radial 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.849
 in this case I have 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.949
 and let me come, I think quite well 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.720
 and as you can see 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.169
 the difference is already considerable this 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.169
 another one also 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.749
 you have to be careful of the type 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.189
 of polishing machine that is put on it because 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:39.189
 we can scratch the car 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.780
 the truth 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.270
 protective plastic 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.610
 At least we have prevented it from running 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.710
 we have to clean all this now 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.760
 well, this one 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.760
 it's the right 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.669
 in this left and it's already 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.669
 much better than it was 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.130
 all right
