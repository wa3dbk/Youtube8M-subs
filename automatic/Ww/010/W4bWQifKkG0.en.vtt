hi I'm mad at engadget expand i'm here
with<00:00:07.730> Gabriel<00:00:08.300> Gabriel<00:00:08.660> what<00:00:08.780> are<00:00:08.840> you

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
with Gabriel Gabriel what are you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.270 
with Gabriel Gabriel what are you
showing<00:00:09.139> here<00:00:09.380> it<00:00:09.469> looks<00:00:09.620> like<00:00:09.740> a<00:00:09.770> 3d<00:00:10.130> printer

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
showing here it looks like a 3d printer

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.850 
showing here it looks like a 3d printer
but<00:00:10.670> it's<00:00:10.820> not<00:00:11.000> well<00:00:11.780> it<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.290> a<00:00:12.320> kind<00:00:12.590> of<00:00:12.740> very

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
but it's not well it is a kind of very

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.650 
but it's not well it is a kind of very
specialized<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.490> be<00:00:13.550> de<00:00:13.640> printer<00:00:13.880> so<00:00:14.210> what

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
specialized to be de printer so what

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.940 
specialized to be de printer so what
we've<00:00:14.750> got<00:00:14.780> here<00:00:14.930> is<00:00:15.140> a<00:00:15.230> machine<00:00:15.410> that<00:00:15.769> turns

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
we've got here is a machine that turns

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.910 
we've got here is a machine that turns
fruit<00:00:16.460> juice<00:00:16.700> into<00:00:16.939> fruit<00:00:17.750> okay<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:18.560> you<00:00:18.740> can

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
fruit juice into fruit okay so you can

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.620 
fruit juice into fruit okay so you can
give<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:19.160> raspberry<00:00:19.400> juice<00:00:19.760> and<00:00:20.060> tell<00:00:20.360> it<00:00:20.480> to

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
give it raspberry juice and tell it to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.940 
give it raspberry juice and tell it to
build<00:00:20.960> something<00:00:21.320> that<00:00:21.349> looks<00:00:21.590> a<00:00:21.680> lot<00:00:21.770> like<00:00:21.890> a

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
build something that looks a lot like a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.280 
build something that looks a lot like a
raspberry<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.550> it<00:00:23.180> feels<00:00:23.419> like<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.020> it's

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
raspberry and it feels like it so it's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.960 
raspberry and it feels like it so it's
made<00:00:24.439> of<00:00:24.560> little<00:00:24.680> droplets<00:00:25.189> that<00:00:25.369> are<00:00:25.520> liquid

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
made of little droplets that are liquid

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.970 
made of little droplets that are liquid
but<00:00:26.540> each<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.750> surrounded<00:00:27.290> by<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.410> very<00:00:27.619> thin

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
but each is surrounded by a very thin

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.650 
but each is surrounded by a very thin
gel<00:00:28.520> membranes<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.149> when<00:00:29.270> you<00:00:29.329> bite<00:00:29.509> into

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
gel membranes so when you bite into

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.030 
gel membranes so when you bite into
these<00:00:29.810> things<00:00:30.020> they<00:00:30.169> pop<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.649> they<00:00:30.770> release

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
these things they pop and they release

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.220 
these things they pop and they release
their<00:00:31.220> juice<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:32.480> what's<00:00:32.630> really<00:00:32.840> cool<00:00:33.050> is

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
their juice but what's really cool is

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.840 
their juice but what's really cool is
instead<00:00:33.890> of<00:00:34.010> just<00:00:34.160> reconstructing<00:00:34.730> these

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
instead of just reconstructing these

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.610 
instead of just reconstructing these
old-fashioned<00:00:35.540> like<00:00:35.720> tree<00:00:36.110> grown<00:00:36.350> fruits

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
old-fashioned like tree grown fruits

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.260 
old-fashioned like tree grown fruits
like<00:00:36.829> raspberries<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.820> can<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.030> things<00:00:38.210> that

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
like raspberries you can do things that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.810 
like raspberries you can do things that
have<00:00:38.420> never<00:00:38.480> existed<00:00:38.900> before<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:39.640> we've<00:00:40.640> made

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
have never existed before so we've made

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.520 
have never existed before so we've made
the<00:00:41.300> tastiest<00:00:41.630> thing<00:00:41.900> we've<00:00:42.080> made<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:42.260> think

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
the tastiest thing we've made I think

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.140 
the tastiest thing we've made I think
it's<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.740> honey<00:00:42.980> berry<00:00:43.250> okay<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:43.970> it's

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's a honey berry okay so it's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.090 
it's a honey berry okay so it's
something<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.540> feels<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.740> lot<00:00:45.890> like<00:00:46.070> a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
something that feels a lot like a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.500 
something that feels a lot like a
blackberry<00:00:46.550> pop<00:00:46.880> it<00:00:46.970> in<00:00:47.030> your<00:00:47.060> mouth<00:00:47.180> but<00:00:47.300> when

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
blackberry pop it in your mouth but when

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.640 
blackberry pop it in your mouth but when
you<00:00:47.600> bite<00:00:47.750> into<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:47.990> it's<00:00:48.170> like<00:00:48.350> having<00:00:48.590> a

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
you bite into it it's like having a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.740 
you bite into it it's like having a
spoonful<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.070> honey<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.490> there's<00:00:50.270> all<00:00:50.510> sorts

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
spoonful of honey and there's all sorts

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.790 
spoonful of honey and there's all sorts
of<00:00:50.780> crazy<00:00:50.990> things<00:00:51.080> you<00:00:51.320> can<00:00:51.440> do<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.590> can<00:00:51.650> do

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
of crazy things you can do you can do

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.230 
of crazy things you can do you can do
combinations<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:52.880> you<00:00:52.970> can<00:00:53.090> have<00:00:53.210> a

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
combinations so you can have a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.960 
combinations so you can have a
strawberry<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.710> cream<00:00:55.070> incorporates<00:00:55.730> into

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
strawberry with cream incorporates into

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.130 
strawberry with cream incorporates into

cream<00:00:57.320> we've<00:00:58.220> made<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.430> wasabi<00:00:59.000> worm<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.960> go<00:01:00.079> on

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
cream we've made a wasabi worm to go on

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.530 
cream we've made a wasabi worm to go on
top<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.410> some<00:01:00.530> nigiri<00:01:00.860> sushi<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.970> little

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.240 
top of some nigiri sushi a little
vanilla<00:01:02.960> berries<00:01:03.380> to<00:01:03.500> go<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.680> top<00:01:03.800> of<00:01:03.920> muffins

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
vanilla berries to go on top of muffins

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.700 
vanilla berries to go on top of muffins
and<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:04.519> on<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:04.820> people<00:01:05.299> can<00:01:05.570> choose<00:01:05.810> not<00:01:06.470> only

absolutely so you can personalize the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.109 
absolutely so you can personalize the
shape<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.109> it<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:13.069> taste<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.460> each<00:01:13.759> droplet

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
shape of it the taste of each droplet

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.899 
shape of it the taste of each droplet
and<00:01:14.840> more<00:01:15.740> importantly<00:01:16.039> the<00:01:16.189> texture<00:01:16.579> so<00:01:16.850> you

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
and more importantly the texture so you

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.609 
and more importantly the texture so you
can<00:01:17.030> give<00:01:17.179> texture<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.689> anything<00:01:18.049> even<00:01:18.409> pure

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
can give texture to anything even pure

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.169 
can give texture to anything even pure
water<00:01:18.859> it's<00:01:19.340> possible<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.729> make<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.060> know

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
water it's possible to make you know

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.950 
water it's possible to make you know
totally<00:01:20.899> calorific<00:01:21.649> on<00:01:22.579> color<00:01:23.090> if<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.420> water

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
totally calorific on color if the water

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.679 
totally calorific on color if the water
berries<00:01:24.319> and<00:01:25.039> you<00:01:25.729> can<00:01:25.850> make<00:01:25.939> it<00:01:25.999> very<00:01:26.119> soft

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
berries and you can make it very soft

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.599 
berries and you can make it very soft
like<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.899> jam<00:01:27.229> or<00:01:27.439> very<00:01:27.740> crisp<00:01:28.009> but<00:01:28.189> like<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.369> kind

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
like a jam or very crisp but like a kind

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.999 
like a jam or very crisp but like a kind
of<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.179> grape<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:30.499> start<00:01:30.740> off<00:01:30.829> as

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
of like a grape and this start off as

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.889 
of like a grape and this start off as
like<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.219> DIY<00:01:31.520> project<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.539> this<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.869> this

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
like a DIY project or is this is this

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.169 
like a DIY project or is this is this
how<00:01:33.499> did<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.679> get<00:01:33.799> started<00:01:34.249> that's<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.090> good

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
how did it get started that's a good

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.840 
how did it get started that's a good
question<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:35.659> um<00:01:35.959> my<00:01:36.490> background<00:01:37.490> I'm<00:01:37.639> the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
question so um my background I'm the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.209 
question so um my background I'm the
chief<00:01:38.179> inventor<00:01:38.479> dub<00:01:38.869> sailed<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.259> my

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
chief inventor dub sailed and my

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.039 
chief inventor dub sailed and my
background<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:40.700> biological<00:01:41.420> physics<00:01:41.899> and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
background is in biological physics and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.020 
background is in biological physics and
few<00:01:42.740> years<00:01:42.859> ago<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.039> developed<00:01:43.249> a<00:01:43.549> 3d<00:01:43.909> printer

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
few years ago I developed a 3d printer

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.679 
few years ago I developed a 3d printer
that<00:01:44.359> made<00:01:44.509> mimics<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.170> synthetic<00:01:45.469> tissues<00:01:46.689> so

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
that made mimics of synthetic tissues so

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.319 
that made mimics of synthetic tissues so
it<00:01:48.009> made<00:01:49.009> things<00:01:49.219> that<00:01:49.369> behaved<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.060> lot<00:01:50.209> like

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
it made things that behaved a lot like

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.849 
it made things that behaved a lot like
tissues<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.749> can<00:01:50.869> play<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.109> same<00:01:51.229> tricks<00:01:51.469> but

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
tissues and can play the same tricks but

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.279 
tissues and can play the same tricks but
from<00:01:52.039> purified<00:01:52.399> ingredients<00:01:52.819> and<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.869> turns

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
from purified ingredients and it turns

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.080 
from purified ingredients and it turns
out<00:01:54.469> that<00:01:54.529> those<00:01:54.859> structures<00:01:55.639> looked

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
out that those structures looked

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.690 
out that those structures looked
delicious<00:01:56.689> they<00:01:56.899> look<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.200> little<00:01:57.319> fruits

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
delicious they look like little fruits

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.039 
delicious they look like little fruits
so<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:58.880> we've<00:01:58.999> done<00:01:59.029> is<00:01:59.240> adapted<00:01:59.630> technology

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
so what we've done is adapted technology

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.529 
so what we've done is adapted technology
I<00:02:00.439> assure<00:02:01.099> you<00:02:01.189> we've<00:02:01.340> changed<00:02:01.939> all<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.359> the

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
I assure you we've changed all of the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.599 
I assure you we've changed all of the
ingredients<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.069> now<00:02:04.069> we've<00:02:04.249> made<00:02:04.429> these

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
ingredients and now we've made these

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.760 
ingredients and now we've made these
little<00:02:04.999> edible<00:02:05.359> structures<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.619> at<00:02:06.709> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
little edible structures and so at the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.929 
little edible structures and so at the
moment<00:02:06.889> it's<00:02:07.099> very<00:02:07.279> much<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.520> prototype

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
moment it's very much in the prototype

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.160 
moment it's very much in the prototype
stage<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.360> we're<00:02:08.509> looking<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.780> commercialize

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
stage and we're looking to commercialize

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.990 
stage and we're looking to commercialize
it<00:02:09.200> soon<00:02:09.440> great<00:02:10.399> thank<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.640> they<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:10.789> look

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
it soon great thank you they do look

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.640 
it soon great thank you they do look
delicious<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:11.480> can't<00:02:11.660> wait<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.900> try<00:02:12.020> one<00:02:12.110> thanks

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
delicious I can't wait to try one thanks

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.480 
delicious I can't wait to try one thanks
again
