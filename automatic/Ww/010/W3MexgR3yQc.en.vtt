00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
one thing I do love about this chair is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.910 
one thing I do love about this chair is
the<00:02:12.330> recline

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
the recline

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.910 
the recline
if<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.819> click<00:02:14.420> right<00:02:15.020> here<00:02:15.319> at<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> bottom<00:02:15.800> of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
if you click right here at the bottom of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760 
if you click right here at the bottom of
the<00:02:15.980> tray<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:17.240> push<00:02:17.600> back<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.470> chair

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
the tray and you push back the chair

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.710 
the tray and you push back the chair
will<00:02:19.069> recline<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:20.000> tilts<00:02:20.180> more<00:02:20.540> than

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
will recline it actually tilts more than

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.780 
will recline it actually tilts more than
this<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.650> have<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
this but the way that I have it in the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.400 
this but the way that I have it in the
seat<00:02:23.030> it's<00:02:23.240> not<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.660> tell<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.110> much

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
seat it's not going to tell that much

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.470 
seat it's not going to tell that much
but<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.490> absolutely<00:02:25.910> perfect<00:02:26.180> for

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
but this is absolutely perfect for

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.320 
but this is absolutely perfect for
children<00:02:26.720> eating<00:02:27.080> bottles<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:28.610> even<00:02:29.120> just

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
children eating bottles or even just

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.000 
children eating bottles or even just
simply<00:02:29.600> cups<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.020> milk<00:02:30.260> because<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.770> helps

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
simply cups of milk because it helps

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.380 
simply cups of milk because it helps
them<00:02:31.100> get<00:02:31.250> every<00:02:31.520> last<00:02:31.730> drop

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.840 

now<00:02:38.390> when<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.470> refine<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.250> also<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.760> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
now when you refine it you also have the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.170 
now when you refine it you also have the
option<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.270> reclining<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.959> tray<00:02:45.700> your<00:02:46.700> cue

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
option of reclining the tray your cue

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.740 
option of reclining the tray your cue
the<00:02:48.020> tray<00:02:48.290> has<00:02:48.790> five<00:02:49.790> different<00:02:50.060> levels<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.600> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the tray has five different levels so it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.330 
the tray has five different levels so it
can<00:02:50.870> move<00:02:50.989> back<00:02:51.260> closer<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.739> your<00:02:51.950> child<00:02:52.190> or

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
can move back closer to your child or

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.710 
can move back closer to your child or
further<00:02:52.580> away<00:02:52.760> depending<00:02:53.239> on<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.420> age<00:02:53.540> of

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
further away depending on the age of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.650 
further away depending on the age of
your<00:02:53.870> child<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.820> tray<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.269> actually

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
your child and the tray can actually

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.259 
your child and the tray can actually
move<00:02:56.870> forward<00:02:57.350> or<00:02:57.709> backward<00:02:57.739> if<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.030> use

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
move forward or backward if you use

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.500 
move forward or backward if you use
these<00:02:59.570> little<00:03:00.050> buttons<00:03:00.830> on<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.070> side<00:03:01.510> there

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
these little buttons on the side there

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.850 
these little buttons on the side there
so<00:03:07.450> sometimes<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.989> can<00:03:09.170> even<00:03:09.380> take<00:03:09.830> your
