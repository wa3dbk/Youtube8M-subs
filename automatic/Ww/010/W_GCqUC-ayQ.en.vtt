00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.390
 one of two minuses of Russian existence 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.910
 Nikolai Gogol considered bad roads 2 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.220
 minus you know from petersburg to 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.470
 Vladivostok permeate our country 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.480
 paths and driveways some of which 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.820
 ready to give unexpected surprises 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.219
 as novice drivers and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.020
 traffic professionals and how 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.879
 would you not be sure of reliability 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.280
 your car risk getting 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.770
 unexpected and very serious breakdown 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.930
 without reliable protection on our roads 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.000
 there is always almost everyone 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.489
 the driver knows that if not installed 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.620
 protection of the engine compartment then even in the city 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.780
 can easily damage the crankcase 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.760
 engine or gearbox housing 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.550
 bumped into the unopened lid 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.879
 sewer manhole us nomads 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.580
 seen in the dark stone or curb 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.070
 let alone about winter roads and say no 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.590
 have ice chunks when frozen 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 necklaces can easily provide your 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.240
 car emergency stop 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.820
 without reliable protection of the lower part 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 car engine any stranger 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.380
 the item can get into the engine compartment and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.390
 damage low mounted units 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.790
 or tear the drive belt not 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.370
 it becomes obvious that get stuck with 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.100
 such a breakdown somewhere in the city of ensk 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.050
 nobody would want damon such 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.200
 unexpected breakdowns on expensive 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.200
 cars will cost a pretty penny solution 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.330
 and one such troubles can save 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.720
 only reliable crankcase protection 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.120
 and transmissions prophet made of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.370
 composite material and today we 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.860
 we will drive an SUV with an installed 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.200
 protection about the mouth on the roads of our city 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.760
 sweep through the country roads and check 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.320
 how reliable 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320
 our defense went 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.850
 the first direction is the city ​​courtyard and 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:28.110
 curbstone sticking out on a turn 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:30.170
 and another 2 protection check about the genus 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.000
 will travel over rough terrain 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.670
 protruding stumps lying on the log path 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.470
 small trees had no effect on 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.470
 patency of our SUV 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:51.900
 and what will happen if we move 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.480
 in the summer on a country highway traffic jams with 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.940
 low speed because the protection of the wire is very 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.130
 tightly closes the bottom of the motor 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.580
 compartment and under the hood should 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.140
 raise the temperature nothing like 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.330
 specially designed ventilation 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.480
 holes provide optimal 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.410
 engine temperature 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.690
 proof of that data 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.640
 temperature sensor installed under 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.640
 the hood next to the exhaust manifold 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.350
 and finally the strength test of protection 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.490
 the prophet and will the composite 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.800
 protection material 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.470
 the weight of our car and then we decided 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.260
 lift our SUV resting in 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.360
 her car jacked up 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.030
 front wheels hung in the air and 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.100
 no damage 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.740
 but we thought it was not enough and then we 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.760
 decided to crush the defense of our weight 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.980
 SUV alas did not work only 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.230
 scratches on the surface say 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.020
 that we drove somewhere badly 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.840
 obstacles with specialists 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.190
 technical center of the national magazine full 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.960
 four by four drive 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.110
 we also conducted comparative tests 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.450
 already serial products from steel and aluminum 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.940
 and composite close to reality 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 to see what happens with the famous 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.260
 materials for the production of protection when 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.290
 instant mechanical action 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.750
 in the workshop at a height of 4 and a half meters on 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.470
 block we hung asymmetric load 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.300
 weighing 26 kilograms and from this height 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.300
 throwing a load of what came out of it 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.610
 4 mm aluminum turned out to be less 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.150
 durable than compazine or stopped 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.150
 only u 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.259
 what is the protection about the mouth is high 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.719

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.849
 each car model 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.129
 protection pro mouth is composite 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.139
 multilayer material consisting of 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.719
 fibrous reinforcing filler and 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.990
 synthetic polymer binder 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.440
 strength of three and a half times 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.750
 superior steel 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.629
 such a composite is chemically resistant 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.710
 active and aggressive substances 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.389
 keeps physical and mechanical 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.120
 characteristics at extreme 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:42.440

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.440
 twenty degrees celsius 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.550
 how is the protection of the prophet first made 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.190
 stage is held three-dimensional 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.620
 scan the bottom of the car on 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.900
 this stage creates an accurate three-dimensional 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.060
 electronic cast of aggregates which 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.669
 protection is needed this is done in order 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.980
 to protect the pro mouth perfectly 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.990
 your car like new clothes 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.389
 then laboratory tests are performed 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.669
 samples of composite material with 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.160
