00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
really got too much of articulation with

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.700 
really got too much of articulation with
them<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.489> okay<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.710> are

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
them but that's okay because they are

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.310 
them but that's okay because they are
pretty<00:00:43.890> good<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.060 

obviously<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.020> removable

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
blasters and basically they've just got

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.939
