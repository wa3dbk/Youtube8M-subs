how<00:03:18.000> maybe<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.780> could<00:03:18.930> play<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.410> like

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
how maybe that could play off of like

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.030 
how maybe that could play off of like
that<00:03:20.730> whole<00:03:20.910> relationship<00:03:21.650> well<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.680> guess

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
that whole relationship well I guess

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
that whole relationship well I guess
I'll<00:03:23.160> figure<00:03:23.310> out<00:03:23.430> more<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:23.760> these<00:03:23.880> upcoming

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
I'll figure out more in these upcoming

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.540 
I'll figure out more in these upcoming
episodes<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.050> didn't<00:03:25.260> impregnate

Battaglia at that moment you feel me at

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.790 
Battaglia at that moment you feel me at
that<00:03:29.550> exact<00:03:30.000> moment<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:31.080> would<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.380> weird<00:03:31.590> cuz

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
that exact moment it would be weird cuz

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.300

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
to have Steven there much like Greg is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.470 
to have Steven there much like Greg is
much<00:03:52.800> older<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.580> flashback<00:03:54.030> Greg<00:03:54.300> is

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
much older and in the flashback Greg is

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.780 
much older and in the flashback Greg is
much<00:03:54.690> younger<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.220> about<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.580> want<00:03:56.730> to

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
much younger so this is about I want to

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.350 
much younger so this is about I want to
say<00:03:56.880> maybe<00:03:57.030> 10<00:03:57.300> or<00:03:57.330> 15<00:03:57.540> 20<00:03:57.840> years<00:03:58.170> between<00:03:59.360> you

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
say maybe 10 or 15 20 years between you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.170 
say maybe 10 or 15 20 years between you
know<00:04:00.480> like<00:04:01.250> when<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.280> first<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.030> get

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
know like when we first and get

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.790 
know like when we first and get
introduced<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.630> Marty<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.170> win<00:04:04.350> they<00:04:04.770> I

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
introduced to Marty to win they I

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.050 
introduced to Marty to win they I
probably<00:04:05.160> actually<00:04:05.489> have<00:04:05.640> Stephen<00:04:05.940> because

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
probably actually have Stephen because

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.170 
probably actually have Stephen because
again<00:04:06.300> Greg<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.870> much<00:04:07.110> much<00:04:07.350> older<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:08.880> mean

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
again Greg is much much older so I mean

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.840 
again Greg is much much older so I mean
it's<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.630> really<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:11.040> depends<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.700> that

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
it's it really just it depends but that

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.490 
it's it really just it depends but that
that<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.239> also<00:04:12.420> very<00:04:12.570> strong<00:04:13.080> theory<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.440> a

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
that is also very strong theory that a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.930 
that is also very strong theory that a
lot<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.650> people<00:04:13.830> have<00:04:13.950> but<00:04:14.340> going<00:04:14.489> back<00:04:14.670> on<00:04:14.820> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
lot of people have but going back on the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.080 
lot of people have but going back on the
topic<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.420> video<00:04:15.540> Sadie<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.830> onion<00:04:17.730> now

onion<00:05:29.040> looks<00:05:29.550> very<00:05:29.850> much<00:05:30.060> like<00:05:30.090> yellowtail

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
onion looks very much like yellowtail

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.469 
onion looks very much like yellowtail
and<00:05:31.590> Sadie<00:05:32.310> looks<00:05:32.550> very<00:05:32.729> much<00:05:32.910> like<00:05:32.940> Barbara

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
and Sadie looks very much like Barbara

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.900 
and Sadie looks very much like Barbara
but<00:05:33.840> they<00:05:33.990> also<00:05:34.229> look<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.070> same<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.490> then<00:05:35.640> I<00:05:35.880> I

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
but they also look the same and then I I

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.490 
but they also look the same and then I I
would<00:05:36.300> even<00:05:36.539> see<00:05:36.810> like<00:05:36.930> if<00:05:36.990> someone<00:05:37.260> said<00:05:37.289> that

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
would even see like if someone said that

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.260 
would even see like if someone said that
yellowtail<00:05:38.039> was<00:05:38.250> saying<00:05:38.460> these<00:05:38.580> dad<00:05:38.789> it<00:05:39.150> would

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
yellowtail was saying these dad it would

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.060 
yellowtail was saying these dad it would
make<00:05:39.390> sense<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.690> me<00:05:39.810> because<00:05:40.289> she<00:05:40.410> looks<00:05:40.620> she

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
make sense to me because she looks she

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.290 
make sense to me because she looks she
looks<00:05:41.250> like<00:05:41.400> she<00:05:41.580> could<00:05:41.700> look<00:05:41.820> like<00:05:41.880> him<00:05:42.150> too

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
looks like she could look like him too

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.180 
looks like she could look like him too
because<00:05:42.419> again<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.900> color<00:05:43.110> palettes<00:05:43.530> there

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
because again the color palettes there

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.000 
because again the color palettes there
too<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:44.820> even<00:05:45.810> with<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.200> her<00:05:46.800> favorite

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
too and even with that her favorite

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.960 
too and even with that her favorite
Sadie's<00:05:47.729> favorite<00:05:48.560> food<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.830> uh<00:05:49.970> oyster

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
Sadie's favorite food is uh oyster

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.960 
Sadie's favorite food is uh oyster
crackers<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.830> again<00:05:52.830> he's<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.220> fisherman<00:05:53.520> so

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
crackers and again he's a fisherman so

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.420 
crackers and again he's a fisherman so
I'll<00:05:54.570> get<00:05:54.750> everything<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.470> whole<00:05:55.590> not<00:05:56.039> like

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
I'll get everything the whole not like

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.860 
I'll get everything the whole not like
nothing<00:05:56.760> just<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.030> coincidence<00:05:57.539> everything's

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
nothing just a coincidence everything's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.710 
nothing just a coincidence everything's
for<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.110> purpose<00:05:58.970> so<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.000> mean<00:06:00.389> that's<00:06:00.510> pretty

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
for a purpose so I mean that's pretty

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.500 
for a purpose so I mean that's pretty
much<00:06:01.110> my<00:06:01.289> whole<00:06:01.340> theory<00:06:02.340> of<00:06:02.460> this<00:06:02.580> video<00:06:02.970> I

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
much my whole theory of this video I

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.020 
much my whole theory of this video I
think<00:06:04.139> Sadie<00:06:04.410> if<00:06:04.710> she's<00:06:05.250> not<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.430> sibling

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
think Sadie if she's not a sibling

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.390 
think Sadie if she's not a sibling
then<00:06:06.479> maybe<00:06:06.780> yellowtail<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:08.039> Barbara

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
then maybe yellowtail and Barbara

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.400 
then maybe yellowtail and Barbara
siblings<00:06:08.910> and<00:06:09.090> she<00:06:09.210> might<00:06:09.360> be<00:06:09.479> a<00:06:09.510> cousin<00:06:09.750> we

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
siblings and she might be a cousin we

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.620 
siblings and she might be a cousin we
haven't<00:06:10.889> seen<00:06:11.100> like<00:06:11.400> her<00:06:11.580> own<00:06:11.940> personal<00:06:12.450> life

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
haven't seen like her own personal life

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.560 
haven't seen like her own personal life
we<00:06:12.930> haven't<00:06:13.139> really<00:06:13.289> seen<00:06:13.410> onions<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.570> sour

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
we haven't really seen onions and sour

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.440 
we haven't really seen onions and sour
creams<00:06:15.930> on<00:06:16.110> personal<00:06:16.470> life<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:16.680> I'm<00:06:16.740> glad<00:06:16.919> that

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
creams on personal life so I'm glad that

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.150 
creams on personal life so I'm glad that
hopefully<00:06:18.450> they<00:06:18.600> expand<00:06:19.080> on<00:06:19.200> this<00:06:19.350> a<00:06:19.590> little

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
hopefully they expand on this a little

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.590 
hopefully they expand on this a little
bit<00:06:20.340> more<00:06:20.550> because<00:06:20.669> I<00:06:20.850> feel<00:06:21.030> like<00:06:21.150> they're<00:06:21.570> all

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
bit more because I feel like they're all

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.270 
bit more because I feel like they're all
well<00:06:22.320> they<00:06:22.410> because<00:06:22.560> we<00:06:22.680> haven't<00:06:22.889> really<00:06:23.010> seen

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
well they because we haven't really seen

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.610 
well they because we haven't really seen
also<00:06:24.090> we<00:06:24.210> haven't<00:06:24.330> really<00:06:24.570> seen<00:06:24.750> sour<00:06:25.320> cream

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
there was one episode where he bought

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.090 
there was one episode where he bought
some<00:06:35.159> food<00:06:35.370> from<00:06:35.580> them<00:06:35.820> but<00:06:35.909> he

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.840 
just do it away for the pelicans or
whatever<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:38.740> I<00:06:38.770> mean<00:06:38.980> it<00:06:39.130> was<00:06:39.220> weird<00:06:39.400> whatever

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
whatever so I mean it was weird whatever

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
he was doing but that's that's the most

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.110 
he was doing but that's that's the most

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
can even talk and then there's a huge

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.630 
can even talk and then there's a huge
other<00:06:50.440> theory<00:06:50.770> that<00:06:50.860> onion<00:06:51.130> might<00:06:51.280> be<00:06:51.370> a<00:06:51.400> Jim
