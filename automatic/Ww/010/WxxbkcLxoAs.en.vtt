00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and it's always great to make these

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:08.619 
and it's always great to make these
suggestions

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.610 

okay<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:09.750> I'm<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:09.989> I'm<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.409> going<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
okay and I'm going to I'm not going to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.899 
okay and I'm going to I'm not going to
finish<00:03:10.739> off<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.129> front<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.640> particular

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
finish off the front on this particular

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.460 
finish off the front on this particular
one<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:12.360> let<00:03:12.720> me<00:03:12.780> add<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.110> bit<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.319> wire

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
one but let me add a little bit of wire

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.670 
one but let me add a little bit of wire
and<00:03:13.680> show<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:14.129> it<00:03:14.250> does<00:03:15.409> to<00:03:16.409> form

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
and show you what it does to form

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.070 
and show you what it does to form
something<00:03:17.069> out<00:03:17.159> of<00:03:17.190> wire<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:18.209> wire<00:03:18.269> is

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
something out of wire and this wire is

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.460 
something out of wire and this wire is
is<00:03:19.290> flat<00:03:19.739> wire<00:03:19.950> I've<00:03:20.879> just<00:03:21.090> taken<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.599> tool<00:03:22.200> with

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
is flat wire I've just taken a tool with

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.089 
is flat wire I've just taken a tool with
a<00:03:22.500> round<00:03:23.190> edge<00:03:23.959> prong<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.260> I've<00:03:25.440> started<00:03:25.799> this

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
a round edge prong and I've started this

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.330 
a round edge prong and I've started this
this<00:03:26.760> flat<00:03:27.090> wire<00:03:27.299> coil<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.349> then<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.980> just

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
this flat wire coil and then I just

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.039 
this flat wire coil and then I just
finished<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.700> off<00:03:29.849> with<00:03:29.879> my<00:03:30.209> hand<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> get<00:03:31.019> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
finished it off with my hand so I get a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.770 
finished it off with my hand so I get a
really<00:03:31.370> relatively<00:03:32.370> uniform<00:03:32.790> round<00:03:33.510> shape

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
really relatively uniform round shape

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.020 
really relatively uniform round shape
which<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.920> shape<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.370> I'm<00:03:35.489> going<00:03:35.790> for

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
which is the shape that I'm going for

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000 
which is the shape that I'm going for
here<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.450> if<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.019> can<00:03:37.200> find<00:03:37.470> something<00:03:37.769> in

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
here and if you can find something in

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.470 
here and if you can find something in
your<00:03:38.129> store<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.790> want<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.120> form<00:03:39.329> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
your store that you want to form the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.750 
your store that you want to form the
wire<00:03:39.660> around<00:03:39.959> for<00:03:40.440> an<00:03:40.500> interesting<00:03:41.010> sort<00:03:41.640> of

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
wire around for an interesting sort of

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430 
wire around for an interesting sort of
Bend<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.239> shape<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.660> saves<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.200> much<00:03:43.230> time

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
Bend or shape it saves so much time

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.830 
Bend or shape it saves so much time
rather<00:03:44.310> than<00:03:44.430> trying<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.359> by<00:03:45.569> hand

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
rather than trying to do this by hand

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.119 
rather than trying to do this by hand
and<00:03:46.049> not<00:03:46.109> necessarily<00:03:46.739> making<00:03:46.920> it

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
and not necessarily making it

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.890 
and not necessarily making it
symmetrical<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:48.060> perfect<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.690> want<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
symmetrical and perfect and I want a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.990 
symmetrical and perfect and I want a
little<00:03:49.140> bit<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.349> a<00:03:49.440> curve<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.640> wire<00:03:50.970> so

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
little bit of a curve on this wire so

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.300 
little bit of a curve on this wire so
I'm<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.079> use<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.470> bubble<00:03:52.829> ball<00:03:52.980> here

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
I'm going to use this bubble ball here

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.720 
I'm going to use this bubble ball here
for<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.640> curve<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.769> adding<00:04:02.069> dimension

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
for that curve and it's adding dimension

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.319 
for that curve and it's adding dimension
and<00:04:02.970> depth<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.680> interest<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.940> just<00:04:06.060> looks

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
and depth and interest in it just looks

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.300 
and depth and interest in it just looks
like<00:04:06.420> there's<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.049> much<00:04:07.170> more<00:04:07.410> value<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.160> what

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
like there's so much more value to what
