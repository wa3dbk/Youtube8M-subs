00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.600
 Autumn knitting route guide motif hen sixth 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:16.760
 This time, by weaving the name of God of salt motif 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:24.940
 Let's deepen the understanding about the practice of the knitting and the crochet of the stand 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.940
 In addition , I will explain the method of thread management because it is a little different from the time of the basic edition. 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:32.860
 I will now show the knitting pattern of the Am motif 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.660
 It is simple to make a two-stage woven salt Nagami 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.390
 Let's start knitting immediately from the stairs 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.480
 In the inside of the long braid 16 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.790
 I wind a thread around my finger 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.790
 There are many winds that can be woven with 16 people, so wrap it around with your fingers in Japan 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.059
 And 3 cases of rising crotch 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.560
 3 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.759
 Count this as a single piece of paper 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.759
 The rest of the name paper 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.580
 1 girl 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.880
 For 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.690
 Three girls and up to 15 people 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.690
 I will advance 3 as it is 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.500
 I made a 16th roll of paper with a rising edge . 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.500
 I will tighten here 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.130
 The point when you knit this is the point 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:17.020
 I pick up the other side of the crotch and the back mountain of the rising crotch and pull it out 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:18.510
 By the way, the back mountain of this crotch is connected with the woman who drinks the next long braid 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.330
 Long-knit 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.840
 It turns out 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.390
 With 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.940
 If you put the needle in the middle of the clutter 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.940
 Pick up nature, Han woman and back mountain 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.010
 Stick the needle like this 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.010
 Pull-out knitting 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.830
 This is the end of the first stage 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.970
 Let's go to the second step . The second step is a repetition of putting in a long bag . 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.240
 First of all, the rising chain Ani 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.240
 1 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.930
 3 years 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.280
 And 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.860
 I picked up the print and the back mountain a while ago and pulled out and knit it 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.020
 To the woman in the first row of crochet 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.790
 A look at Eimi 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.950
 I 'm sorry this time 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.950
 It is an eye below that 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:26.660
 I 'm knitting now that there is a rising chain 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:31.690
 It considers the same thing as I braided into the hair, such in this paper to cover 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:37.830
 The woman after this is a repetition of being able to rank third in the hair 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:45.950
 First knitted picking up the found and the mountain behind the chain result of the following 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.950
 As Eimi's head is expanding a little, let's put in a thread with caution only there . 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.620
 Paper glance 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.230
 2 people 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.000
 Okaba's no particular problem I will continue to knit as it is 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.829
 We are finished knitting to the last of the second step Eimi 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.829
 I will start thread management with chain connection from here 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.620
 And this is 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:39.639
 It is a chain of the first rise of the second penetration 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:45.850
 Because this Kusari is not considered to be Eimi. 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:52.630
 It seems like you are correct to the chain connecting stab the needle in the head of this chain 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:55.070
 But here in order to connect to more beautiful dare to head of the and become length knitting 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.990
 Thread thread 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.730
 On the head of long knitting 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.730
 Stab the needle from the instep 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.270
 Make 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.270
 I'll finish the sound 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:28.870
 I dare not tighten this chain small 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.310
 In the size of just one minute of the head of God 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.310
 Let the chain 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 This remaining intention is 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.770
 In the back of the chain 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.770
 I will clean up after I let it go 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.449
 Here is this 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.449
 In the feeling that it passes zigzag around the back mountain 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.509
 The last is the god 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.509
 Let your feet go 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.919
 And it will be completed if you cut Ito 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:25.490
 This is this 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.490
 The part of the chain head part of the god's head was connected beautifully 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.660
 This is the completion of the salt motif of God 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:38.960
 The point is to count rising crotch as a single eye 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:47.240
 In the next step, find the chain and pick up the back mountain and knit it 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:51.729
 And in the last chain connection, connect it to the head of the god next to it, not to knit it. 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.729
 So this was until you tired of so far
