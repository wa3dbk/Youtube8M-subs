00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
in a stalemate at the point of my

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
in a stalemate at the point of my
youtube<00:00:24.660> channel<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:25.170> yeah<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:25.949> steadily

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
youtube channel like yeah I'm steadily

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400 
youtube channel like yeah I'm steadily
growing<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
growing you know but it's more of like a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.230 
growing you know but it's more of like a
linear<00:00:28.800> trend<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.789> those<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.090> who

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
linear trend so for those of you who

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780 
linear trend so for those of you who
aren't<00:00:30.769> mathematically<00:00:31.769> inclined<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
aren't mathematically inclined what I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.700 
aren't mathematically inclined what I
mean<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.420> grow<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
mean is it's grow I'm going out like a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.990 
mean is it's grow I'm going out like a
steady<00:00:35.010> pace<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.610> hasn't<00:00:35.910> really

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
steady pace and it hasn't really

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450 
steady pace and it hasn't really
increased<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.899> much<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.800> basically

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
increased all that much so basically

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.860 
increased all that much so basically
like<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.790> guys<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.090> been<00:00:39.120> noticing<00:00:39.660> these

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
like you guys have been noticing these

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.500 
like you guys have been noticing these
kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.200> shorter<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:41.610> condensed<00:00:42.210> videos

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
kind of shorter more condensed videos

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.150 
kind of shorter more condensed videos
that<00:00:42.690> basically<00:00:42.960> covered<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> same<00:00:43.710> thing<00:00:44.010> my

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that basically covered the same thing my

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
that basically covered the same thing my
longer<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.850> 30<00:00:45.059> 40<00:00:45.390> minute<00:00:45.690> videos<00:00:45.930> did

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
longer you know 30 40 minute videos did

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
longer you know 30 40 minute videos did
but<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> much<00:00:46.920> shorter<00:00:46.980> time<00:00:47.579> span<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
but in a much shorter time span and I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
but in a much shorter time span and I
feel<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> much<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> point

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
feel it was a much more get to the point

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.630 
feel it was a much more get to the point
kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> style<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.920> like<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> don't<00:00:53.309> really

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
kind of style and like I don't really

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
kind of style and like I don't really
want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> say<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.149> being<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> sellout<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:55.020> like

keep looking over here is the mics here

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
keep looking over here is the mics here
and<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.659> cameras<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.680> a

and the cameras here it's it's like a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.560 
and the cameras here it's it's like a
weird<00:02:04.920> dilemma<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.399> got<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:05.790> anyways

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
weird dilemma I got going but anyways

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.889 
weird dilemma I got going but anyways
the<00:02:06.780> point<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.140> um<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:08.340> keep<00:02:09.090> doing<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the point of this um I keep doing this

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.530 
the point of this um I keep doing this
to<00:02:10.830> try<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.069> increase<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.030> skill<00:02:12.270> level<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to try and increase the skill level of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
to try and increase the skill level of
my<00:02:12.690> viewers<00:02:13.200> right<00:02:13.379> so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
my viewers right so

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.370 
my viewers right so
so<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:15.210> doesn't<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.510> matter<00:02:15.660> what<00:02:15.960> kind<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
so it doesn't really matter what kind of

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.110 
so it doesn't really matter what kind of
video<00:02:16.620> i<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.010> right<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.520> I've<00:02:17.670> done<00:02:17.819> my<00:02:17.970> how

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
video i do right like I've done my how

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
video i do right like I've done my how
to<00:02:18.180> counter<00:02:18.540> series<00:02:18.930> I've<00:02:19.110> done<00:02:19.560> these<00:02:19.709> short

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to counter series I've done these short

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.400 
to counter series I've done these short
concise<00:02:20.370> videos<00:02:20.760> I've<00:02:21.270> done<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.810> longer<00:02:22.230> full

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
concise videos I've done the longer full

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.570 
concise videos I've done the longer full
commentaries<00:02:22.890> where<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.130> basically<00:02:23.280> talk

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
commentaries where I basically talk

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.010 
commentaries where I basically talk
about<00:02:23.760> what's<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.330> entire<00:02:24.660> game

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
about what's going on the entire game

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.740 
about what's going on the entire game
and<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:26.100> feel<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:26.910> these<00:02:27.120> shorter<00:02:27.420> ones<00:02:27.569> are

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and I feel like these shorter ones are

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.270 
and I feel like these shorter ones are
more<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.230> right<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.620> point<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.980> more

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
more get right to the point and more

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.830 
more get right to the point and more
applicable<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:30.150> most<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> people<00:02:30.510> because

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
applicable to most of people because

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.110 
applicable to most of people because
like<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.590> said<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.040> comment<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.910> last

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
like I said in that comment of my last

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.120 
like I said in that comment of my last
one<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:34.110> they<00:02:34.230> were<00:02:34.260> only<00:02:34.380> getting<00:02:34.590> viewed<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
one but they were only getting viewed to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.520 
one but they were only getting viewed to
like<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:36.450> seven<00:02:36.840> minutes<00:02:36.990> seven<00:02:37.350> half

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
like like seven minutes seven half

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.870 
like like seven minutes seven half
minutes<00:02:37.830> was<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> average<00:02:38.160> views<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:38.790> of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
minutes was the average views on one of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.040 
minutes was the average views on one of
my<00:02:38.970> videos<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.390> that's<00:02:39.510> because<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.810> have

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
my videos and that's because I have

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.770 
my videos and that's because I have
probably<00:02:40.350> 200<00:02:40.709> full<00:02:41.520> length<00:02:41.790> 30<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.330> 40<00:02:42.570> minute

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
probably 200 full length 30 to 40 minute

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.180 
probably 200 full length 30 to 40 minute
videos<00:02:43.020> which<00:02:43.200> are<00:02:43.290> first<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.920> all<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.040> takes

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
videos which are first of all it takes

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.610 
videos which are first of all it takes
me<00:02:44.310> about<00:02:44.430> 12<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.390> 15<00:02:45.540> hours<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.140> upload<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.530> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
me about 12 to 15 hours to upload one of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.380 
me about 12 to 15 hours to upload one of
those<00:02:46.739> these<00:02:47.190> shorter<00:02:47.610> more<00:02:47.730> condensed<00:02:48.120> ones

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
those these shorter more condensed ones

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.050 
those these shorter more condensed ones
are<00:02:48.770> basically<00:02:49.770> an<00:02:49.890> hour<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.850> know<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
are basically an hour like I know it's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.759 
are basically an hour like I know it's
not<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.360> 12th<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.780> size<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.410> because<00:02:52.650> I'm

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
not a 12th the size but because I'm

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.990 
not a 12th the size but because I'm
rendering<00:02:53.010> them<00:02:53.340> differently<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.790> I'm<00:02:53.880> not

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
rendering them differently and I'm not

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
rendering them differently and I'm not
doing<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> same<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.959> same<00:02:54.989> style<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.980> lot

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
doing the same the same style it's a lot

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.550 
doing the same the same style it's a lot
shorter<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> lot<00:02:56.850> easier<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.269> upload<00:02:57.810> my

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
shorter and a lot easier to upload my
