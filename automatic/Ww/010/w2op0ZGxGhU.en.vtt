 Good, I 'll start with the cabinet that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.070

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.090

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 I found it cheap and well out of your 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.860
 Cabinet is good 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 I'll get a 400 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.880

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.790
 that I'm going to get her, it's okay, I do not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.479
 I'm going to get an optical drive because I do not 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.250

 will not take ss I get HD I 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.939
 I think it's not better, but it's because the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.549
 excess of it is more expensive there goes 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.350
