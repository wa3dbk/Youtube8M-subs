would you bury it we shoot a job to that

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.210 
would you bury it we shoot a job to that
point<00:00:15.690> then<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.170> make<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> work<00:00:16.590> yeah<00:00:17.039> it's

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
point then to make it work yeah it's

point then to make it work yeah it's
great<00:00:17.400> not<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.789> blocks<00:00:18.119> up<00:00:18.359> top<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.770> in

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
great not to have blocks up top and in

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.189 
great not to have blocks up top and in
canyon<00:00:20.789> ferry<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.330> always<00:00:21.869> thought<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
canyon ferry I always thought the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.660 
canyon ferry I always thought the
Skeeter<00:00:22.439> drivers<00:00:22.859> were<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.189> kind<00:00:23.609> of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
Skeeter drivers were just kind of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.859 
Skeeter drivers were just kind of
blowing<00:00:23.850> smoke<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.359> they<00:00:24.449> said<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:24.779> you

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
blowing smoke when they said when you

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.269 
blowing smoke when they said when you
bring<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> boom<00:00:25.289> down<00:00:25.470> flat<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.010> makes<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
bring the boom down flat it makes a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.910 
bring the boom down flat it makes a
difference<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:26.970> feel<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.359> happened

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
difference so they feel it happened

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
difference so they feel it happened
don't<00:00:28.920> they<00:00:29.010> say<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.670> gap<00:00:29.910> makes<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.539> like

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
don't they say that the gap makes a like

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.900 
don't they say that the gap makes a like
a<00:00:30.869> vortex<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> other<00:00:31.890> side<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.460> causes

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
a vortex on the other side which causes

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.780 
a vortex on the other side which causes
drag<00:00:33.210> yes<00:00:34.020> yeah<00:00:34.469> exactly<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> your<00:00:35.640> ear

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
drag yes yeah exactly a lot of your ear

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
drag yes yeah exactly a lot of your ear
escapes<00:00:36.239> underneath<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.230> gets<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> swell

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
escapes underneath and then gets a swell

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
escapes underneath and then gets a swell
going<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.760> cognitive<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> lot<00:00:39.989> more

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
going and cognitive there are a lot more

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
going and cognitive there are a lot more
advanced<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.800> mast<00:00:41.579> rotation<00:00:42.149> here<00:00:42.649> but<00:00:43.649> we

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
advanced on mast rotation here but we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270 
advanced on mast rotation here but we
don't<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.260> huge<00:00:46.260> mass<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.770> rotate<00:00:47.129> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
don't have the huge mass to rotate that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
don't have the huge mass to rotate that
they<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.489> either<00:00:49.789> yeah<00:00:50.789> yeah<00:00:51.660> they've<00:00:51.840> got

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
they do either yeah yeah they've got

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.910 
they do either yeah yeah they've got
pulleys<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> ropes<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:54.230> here's<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> complex

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pulleys and ropes and here's a complex

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
pulleys and ropes and here's a complex
not<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.590> comes<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:59.010> being<00:00:59.309> very<00:00:59.399> simple

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
not it all comes out being very simple

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.680 
not it all comes out being very simple
yeah<00:01:00.180> yo<00:01:00.510> rose<00:01:01.140> early<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:03.000> work<00:01:03.180> simple

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
yeah yo rose early that it work simple

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.910 
yeah yo rose early that it work simple
yeah<00:01:04.309> yeah<00:01:05.309> bubble<00:01:06.180> votes<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:07.200> running<00:01:07.500> 28

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
yeah yeah bubble votes are running 28

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380 
yeah yeah bubble votes are running 28
and<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> half<00:01:08.189> foot<00:01:08.400> mass<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.210> much

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and a half foot mass so they are much

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080 
and a half foot mass so they are much
shorter<00:01:09.570> full<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.220> pull<00:01:11.490> from<00:01:11.820> one

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
shorter full so they can pull from one

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.679 
shorter full so they can pull from one
point<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.200> both<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.439> trim<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> donor

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
point and get both the trim in the donor

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.969 
point and get both the trim in the donor
7-foot<00:01:15.689> booms<00:01:15.900> too<00:01:16.140> long<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> I've

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
7-foot booms too long to do that I've

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
7-foot booms too long to do that I've
started<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.460> trying<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
started out trying to do it that way and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
started out trying to do it that way and
couldn't<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.590> enough<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.030> had<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.270> go

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
couldn't get enough down so I had to go

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.270 
couldn't get enough down so I had to go
back<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> traditional<00:01:22.439> Ford<00:01:23.100> sort<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> act

not the jet not the j foot yeah oh yeah
how's<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.430> old<00:01:31.700> skeeters<00:01:32.240> like<00:01:32.510> yeah<00:01:32.720> yeah

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
how's the old skeeters like yeah yeah

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.450 
how's the old skeeters like yeah yeah
they<00:01:33.140> alternated<00:01:33.530> yeah<00:01:33.890> yeah<00:01:39.070> look<00:01:40.070> like<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
they alternated yeah yeah look like the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.620 
they alternated yeah yeah look like the
ends<00:01:40.670> oh<00:01:40.880> yeah<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.759> carbon<00:01:43.970> fiber<00:01:44.300> mass

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
ends oh yeah and the carbon fiber mass

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.020 
ends oh yeah and the carbon fiber mass
are<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.140> same<00:01:45.350> dimension<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.820> original

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
are the same dimension that the original

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.580 
are the same dimension that the original
DN<00:01:47.630> was<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.020> know<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> two<00:01:48.409> by<00:01:48.560> four

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
DN was you know it's a two by four

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.719 
DN was you know it's a two by four
section<00:01:53.229> that's<00:01:54.229> where<00:01:54.409> then<00:01:54.680> Xers<00:01:55.130> such

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
section that's where then Xers such

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.490 
section that's where then Xers such
racing<00:01:56.180> each<00:01:56.509> other<00:01:56.659> than<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.020> other<00:01:57.110> guy<00:01:57.259> the

racing each other than the other guy the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.340 
racing each other than the other guy the
other<00:01:58.009> guy<00:01:58.130> always<00:01:58.369> has<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:59.240> should<00:01:59.750> have<00:02:00.020> two

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
other guy always has I should have two

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.570 
other guy always has I should have two
classes<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.890> formula<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> would<00:02:03.890> strictly

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
classes a formula and the would strictly

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.109 
classes a formula and the would strictly
would<00:02:04.940> oh<00:02:05.320> yeah<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:06.590> no<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.250> club<00:02:07.460> class<00:02:07.789> or

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
would oh yeah but no the club class or

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.270 
would oh yeah but no the club class or
something<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.830> get<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.039> lot<00:02:10.250> more

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
something like that you get a lot more

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.770 
something like that you get a lot more
people<00:02:10.759> out<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:10.970> had<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.120> lot<00:02:11.209> more<00:02:11.269> people<00:02:11.690> in

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
people out you had a lot more people in
