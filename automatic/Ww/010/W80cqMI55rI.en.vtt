00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.340
 hi friends this is my guys 15 so I 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.470
 present you a little tutorial on black 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.970
 ops just can not be anymore 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.550
 the war so just to tell you that as soon 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.869
 that I finally received blackhawks 2 I was 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.869
 a little tanned 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.900
 and then I discovered the game I saw 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.370
 that I love her finally it was not 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.690
 languages ​​it's like little delays 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.910
 it made little bugs as if we 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 was on minecraft nice comparison 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.750
 so here is I showed you the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.720
 plans it takes for me the hague and and 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.559
 have finally not a good collection 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.920
 but a fluid game so the resolution 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.360
 of screen must put in 800 x 600 it does not 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.559
 will not change your screen size I 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.150
 you say it's just that it will reduce 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.490
 a little the quality of the graphics is 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.720
 very slightly it is not seen after 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.190
 full screen just not for it 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.940
 make a small window but the screen 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.530
 tier number of screens one or 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.440
 many if you do not have two or three 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.600
 or four or five voices the brightness 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.130
 perso I put to the maximum because 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.190
 like that it's good but it does not change 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.420
 not the game mode I think after field 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.060
 of vision for sure you want this 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.890
 with which you manage union 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.840
 in fact what more do you defend me a 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.520
 great vision plus you see it wide and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.740
 my members and see them far away I have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.330
 put 80 usually and plays with his sail 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.060
 in the frozen shade put in weak like that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.030
 reduced effects dolls ty bottom I do not 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.310
 do not know at all what it is moaning 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.830
 it behaves better name indicators 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.460
 complete is color blood messages 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.990
 displayed after you are ahead and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.170
 makes you leave automatic texture 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 weak texture filtering what is 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.909
 normal anti-aliasing 100 f x2 to no 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.010
 Ambient occlusion without and depth of 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.450
 weak field after in sync 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.100
 of image what is more important I 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.110
 think because as if you saw the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.459
 life of other codes jordan 23 he said I 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.989
 will change that for the time of 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 connection in the loading bar 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.040
 for easter at this too long but that 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.910
 also plays will be the fluidity of the game so 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.620
 I put no unlimited pictures and the fps 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.880
 it depends how you are actually 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.500
 it's just for example with hit 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.030
 I do not put it that I knew that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.470
 the level I was working all so 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.010
 this is simple 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.180
 so that's the sound I put down because 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 it's to make the video here otherwise 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 after it's like you want it here it does not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.780
 change nothing then it's all 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.060
 here 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.700
 I want to thank the person who 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.770
 given these settings which is firefly where 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.500
 snake it depends how he wants me 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.850

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.990
