00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
about I think it's a terrific project it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610 
about I think it's a terrific project it
makes<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.190> Bible<00:02:48.580> real<00:02:49.239> once<00:02:49.569> again

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
makes the Bible real once again

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.690 
makes the Bible real once again
and<00:02:51.769> indeed<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.430> could<00:02:52.580> be<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.629> world<00:02:54.700> it's

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
and indeed it could be in the world it's

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.190 
and indeed it could be in the world it's
such<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> big<00:02:56.870> community<00:02:57.400> project<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.599> can't

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
such a big community project so I can't

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.229 
such a big community project so I can't
imagine<00:03:00.260> why<00:03:00.620> people<00:03:00.650> wouldn't<00:03:01.129> want<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.790> do

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
imagine why people wouldn't want to do

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.240 
imagine why people wouldn't want to do
it<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:02.959> I'd<00:03:03.170> be<00:03:03.349> really<00:03:03.500> encouraging<00:03:04.099> for
