00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you know really more than enough room in

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.319 
you know really more than enough room in
the<00:02:20.900> front<00:02:21.079> area<00:02:21.530> here<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> back<00:02:22.400> seats<00:02:22.910> do

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.160 
okay but really cargo area I think is
where<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.739> vehicle<00:02:28.480> limits<00:02:29.480> itself<00:02:29.930> if

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
where this vehicle limits itself if

have on board the 5-speed manual because

the optional four-speed automatic is

the optional four-speed automatic is

painfully slow that thing would feel at

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.990 
painfully slow that thing would feel at
least<00:03:26.840> with<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.110> 5-speed<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.830> can<00:03:28.070> rev<00:03:28.730> out

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
least with the 5-speed you can rev out

the<00:03:29.330> lower<00:03:29.540> gears<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.170> get<00:03:30.320> up<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:31.460> know

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
the lower gears and get up to you know

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
clip and then once you're there really

we're<00:03:35.450> quite<00:03:35.630> happy<00:03:35.660> with<00:03:36.050> how<00:03:36.200> it's<00:03:36.410> moving

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
we're quite happy with how it's moving

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.740 
we're quite happy with how it's moving
along<00:03:36.860> what<00:03:37.580> one<00:03:37.790> thing<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.060> do<00:03:38.210> notice<00:03:38.450> when

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
along what one thing you do notice when

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.280 
along what one thing you do notice when
you<00:03:38.900> when<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.410> go<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:40.040> level<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
you when you go to this level of the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.740 
you when you go to this level of the
automotive<00:03:42.620> spectrum<00:03:43.250> compared<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.360> even<00:03:44.660> an

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
automotive spectrum compared to even an

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.940 
automotive spectrum compared to even an
average<00:03:45.050> family<00:03:45.290> sedan<00:03:45.770> these<00:03:45.980> days<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.580> the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
average family sedan these days is the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.520 
average family sedan these days is the
wind<00:03:48.950> noise<00:03:49.160> inside<00:03:49.760> they<00:03:49.970> really<00:03:50.360> do<00:03:50.720> kind<00:03:51.350> of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
wind noise inside they really do kind of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.930 
wind noise inside they really do kind of
start<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.950> strip<00:03:52.220> out<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:54.490> sound<00:03:55.490> deadening

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
start to strip out the sound deadening

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.360 
start to strip out the sound deadening
material<00:03:56.050> so<00:03:57.050> we<00:03:57.410> hear<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.650> lot<00:03:57.890> more<00:03:58.070> wind

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
material so we hear a lot more wind

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.820 
material so we hear a lot more wind
noise<00:03:58.460> we<00:03:59.360> hear<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.540> lot<00:03:59.750> more<00:03:59.780> tire<00:04:00.260> noise<00:04:00.500> and

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
noise we hear a lot more tire noise and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.290 
noise we hear a lot more tire noise and
we<00:04:00.890> really<00:04:01.100> hear<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> lot<00:04:01.430> more<00:04:01.640> engine<00:04:02.120> noise

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
we really hear a lot more engine noise

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.230 
we really hear a lot more engine noise
so<00:04:03.100> it's<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.220> bit<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.490> mixed<00:04:04.730> bag<00:04:04.760> do<00:04:05.150> we

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
so it's a bit of a mixed bag do we

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.060 
so it's a bit of a mixed bag do we
really<00:04:05.480> like<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.870> exterior<00:04:06.350> styling<00:04:06.650> no

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
really like the exterior styling no

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.420 
really like the exterior styling no
we're<00:04:07.400> probably<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.940> little<00:04:08.420> too<00:04:09.110> old<00:04:09.650> actually

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
we're probably a little too old actually

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.830 
we're probably a little too old actually
for<00:04:10.730> there<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.300> mean<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.600> looks<00:04:12.370> fine<00:04:13.370> but<00:04:14.210> it's

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
for there I mean it looks fine but it's

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.630 
for there I mean it looks fine but it's
you<00:04:15.410> know<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.710> buggy<00:04:15.920> headlights<00:04:16.430> are

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
you know the buggy headlights are

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.900 
you know the buggy headlights are
probably<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.090> bit<00:04:17.330> much<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.890> then<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.700> wheels

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
probably a bit much and then the wheels

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.700 
probably a bit much and then the wheels
actually<00:04:20.570> with<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.930> tall<00:04:21.109> as<00:04:21.230> this<00:04:21.320> vehicle

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
actually with this tall as this vehicle

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.920 
actually with this tall as this vehicle
as<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:21.890> wheels<00:04:22.070> are<00:04:22.280> 15<00:04:22.610> inches<00:04:23.000> but<00:04:23.570> they<00:04:23.720> say

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
as the wheels are 15 inches but they say

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.560 
as the wheels are 15 inches but they say
they<00:04:24.440> seem<00:04:24.740> really<00:04:25.310> small<00:04:25.850> looking<00:04:26.270> on<00:04:26.390> this

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
they seem really small looking on this

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.600 
they seem really small looking on this
vehicle<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.200> we're<00:04:27.800> fine<00:04:27.980> with<00:04:28.010> 15<00:04:28.460> inch

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
vehicle and we're fine with 15 inch

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.330 
vehicle and we're fine with 15 inch
wheels<00:04:28.670> but<00:04:29.090> they<00:04:29.540> just<00:04:29.690> look<00:04:29.840> kind<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.340> give

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
wheels but they just look kind of give

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.500 
wheels but they just look kind of give
you<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.490> little<00:04:31.520> chuckle<00:04:32.030> when<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.210> look<00:04:32.360> at

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
you a little chuckle when you look at

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.350 
you a little chuckle when you look at
them<00:04:32.630> because<00:04:32.750> they<00:04:33.140> they<00:04:34.010> look<00:04:34.370> smaller<00:04:35.120> than

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
them because they they look smaller than

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.790 
them because they they look smaller than
I<00:04:35.390> think<00:04:35.660> they<00:04:35.780> really<00:04:36.020> are<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.530> vehicle

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
I think they really are on this vehicle

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.700 
I think they really are on this vehicle
but<00:04:37.280> no<00:04:37.940> fault<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.360> Chevrolet's<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:39.590> know

but no fault of Chevrolet's you know

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.580 
but no fault of Chevrolet's you know
really<00:04:40.070> overall<00:04:40.400> at<00:04:41.390> this<00:04:41.750> price<00:04:42.080> point<00:04:42.410> we

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
really overall at this price point we

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.750 
really overall at this price point we
are<00:04:42.860> blown<00:04:43.220> away

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
are blown away

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.630 
are blown away
by<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.770> value<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.920> you're<00:04:46.130> getting<00:04:46.160> here

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
by the value that you're getting here

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.230 
by the value that you're getting here
you<00:04:47.600> know<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.640> comparable<00:04:49.640> vehicle<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
you know a comparable vehicle like the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.510 
you know a comparable vehicle like the
Fiat<00:04:50.480> 500<00:04:50.720> as<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.740> style<00:04:52.040> that<00:04:52.190> we're<00:04:52.490> a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
Fiat 500 as the style that we're a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.630 
Fiat 500 as the style that we're a
little<00:04:52.880> more<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.750> board<00:04:54.620> with<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.190> we<00:04:55.340> would

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
little more on board with so we would

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.010 
little more on board with so we would
probably<00:04:56.060> give<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.480> nod<00:04:56.660> in<00:04:56.690> that

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
probably give it the nod in that

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.500 
probably give it the nod in that
category<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.400> has<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.850> slight<00:04:59.240> more

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
category and it has just a slight more

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.390 
category and it has just a slight more
power<00:04:59.780> on<00:05:00.140> paper<00:05:00.470> although<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:00.920> think<00:05:01.040> driving

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
power on paper although I think driving

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.340 
power on paper although I think driving
him<00:05:01.610> back<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.970> back<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.840> wouldn't<00:05:03.170> notice

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
him back to back you wouldn't notice

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.480 
him back to back you wouldn't notice
much<00:05:03.800> of<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:04.070> difference<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:06.560> this<00:05:06.860> absolutely

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
much of a difference but this absolutely

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.400 
much of a difference but this absolutely
blows<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:07.880> away<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.120> think<00:05:08.330> an<00:05:08.840> included

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
blows it away I think an included

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.830 
blows it away I think an included
content<00:05:09.890> for<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.180> 15,000<00:05:11.180> it's<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.630> very

content for that 15,000 it's a very

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.080

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
strong package overall for those looking

it's a pretty frugal vehicle overall and

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.830 
it's a pretty frugal vehicle overall and
I<00:05:51.260> think<00:05:52.040> for<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.400> lot<00:05:52.580> of<00:05:52.610> people<00:05:53.000> like<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.600> said

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
I think for a lot of people like I said

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.150 
I think for a lot of people like I said
it's<00:05:54.020> going<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.260> be<00:05:54.380> all<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.650> vehicle<00:05:55.010> they

it's going to be all the vehicle they

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.720 
it's going to be all the vehicle they
need<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.670> probably<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.240> couple<00:05:57.020> of<00:05:57.080> surprises

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
need and probably a couple of surprises

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.670

that<00:05:58.730> they<00:05:59.510> didn't<00:05:59.750> even<00:05:59.840> expect<00:06:00.320> at<00:06:00.530> this

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
that they didn't even expect at this

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
price point because I know we didn't

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.210

what's at the other end of the spectrum

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.640 
what's at the other end of the spectrum
and<00:06:44.520> that's<00:06:44.610> why<00:06:44.850> we're<00:06:45.060> driving<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.650> 2013

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
and that's why we're driving the 2013

and that's why we're driving the 2013
Chevrolet<00:06:47.430> Spark<00:06:47.910> because<00:06:48.480> this<00:06:48.690> has<00:06:48.960> a<00:06:49.350> 1
