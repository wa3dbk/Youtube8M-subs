00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 half america lies in treacherous ruins 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.790
 traitor lynch the family of the protagonist a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 the fate of the world is in the hands 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 mysterious organization of ghosts call 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.470
 of duty is finally what i am 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.520
 considered to be after a couple of years 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.520
 absolute disappointment 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.030
 according to the guest story after 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.130
 economic collapse in a number 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 oil producing countries of the south 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.760
 Americans decide to unite under the banner 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.810
 some federation and destroy america 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.430
 really what else can you do 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.410
 Commonwealth of countries including 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.690
 brazil and uruguay on the verge 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.340
 After spending power crisis 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 a few hours of play you begin to understand 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.480
 that no intrigue behind all this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.060
 action is not worth the explosions exist 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.980
 for the sake of the blast that the enemies are representatives 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.280
 countries of South America remember no more 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.760
 than hear gates or pastor gave somewhere 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.830
 behind 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.450
 no cause-effect relationships 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.550
 besides trying to hint us 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 why after the attack of the oil well we 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.440
 we find ourselves buried under the sand 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 Las Vegas is simply no separate 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.729
 mention deserves the main 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.260
 GOST antagonist by the name of rork possessing 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.720
 appearance of all the characters at once 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.760
 80s action movies and charisma and leather 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.680
 couch on the background of canceled bastards from 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.720
 modern warfare and black ops 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.300
 Roarke looks not just a pity 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.670
 really funny to say serious 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.500
 characters replicas are limited to the most 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.830
 ugly clichés that you can 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.810
 It’s simply impossible to imagine 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.729
 less abstracted 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.710
 from the plot nonsense that should have been 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.890
 evolve you if you in due time 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.860
 played a series of modern warfare gameplay 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.509
 call of duty gb with places you can find 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.130
 attractive endless skirmish 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.080
 with a faceless enemy sometimes skillfully 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.720
 diluted with interesting gaming 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 situations that will give a hundred or two people 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.220
 kill doomsday weapon then in space 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 shoot well under water and that's it 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.350
 call of duty all these moments let them 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.550
 forced to pause the game to 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.590
 calm down take a breath somehow 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.240
 was once with modern warfare but rather 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.880
 not bad motivates to go through the game to the end 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.890
 but frankly not all shaft scene 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.600
 came out as strong as say the jump 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.819
 from skyscraper together federation day 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.980
 which many know from the presentation and 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.800
 sometimes it seems that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.660
 different missions answered different studios that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.000
 In principle, it is possible considering that in addition to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.340
 infinity ward for development were 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.200
 responsible raven software i never saw 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.270
 the end 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.319
 but the less worthwhile moment in the game 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.930
 there is and it pleases 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.120
 Alas, the problem of modern warfare 3 remained 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.069
 in place to enjoy really 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.310
 interesting moments of the game have 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.140
 literally hack your way through 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.340
 insanely exciting positional 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.410
 skirmishes with hordes of evil 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.700
 South Americans 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.800
 the shootings in the game are all the same boring 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.989
 the enemies still shamelessly spawn 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.269
 right under the player’s nose all weapons 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.250
 the same wood more than that of many 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.220
 players will be surprised by sudden deaths 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.069
 every time you happen 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.180
 moving a little further than the front line with 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.610
 technical point of view despite 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.950
 loud statements onext genius thousands 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.450
 polygons are also not very smooth 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.819
 it's not even disgusting 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.890
 optimization unnecessarily high 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.680
 system requirements for what it gave 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.690
 alas players technological leap out 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 hardly more than a similar am 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.870
 earth's their black ops 2 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.360
 occurred within one generation 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.340
 consoles and let beautiful light 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.560
 high texture rendering range 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.959
 permissions really add a point to 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.180
 piggy bank gostof but really beautiful 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.739
 places in the game very little assault drill 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.299
 setting some landscapes in the zone 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.269
 expression really look 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.709
 interesting but nothing more all the rest 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.410
 the scenery in the game does not cause 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.760
 enthusiastic emotions it's a shame given 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.920
 what theme infinity ward have chosen 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.480
 a worthy guest could call out 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.750
 duty to a new level in terms of the atmosphere 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.000
 but alas not in the atmosphere also beats and 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.190
 music no song worth 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.769
 Separate listening is not commonplace . 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.600
 interestingly monotonous is it worth talking about 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.300
 that music has always been one of 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.860
 the greatest strengths of call of duty 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.840
 summarizing the call of duty goust in all 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.370
 relationship takes a huge step backwards 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.350
 compared to black ops 2 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.389
 possessing an improved engine 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.090
 sometimes she manages to look worse 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.889
 than the last game from treyarch to visit 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.690
 not only no plot options and although 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.000
 would be something remotely resembling it 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.590
 after the introduction of strategic missions and 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.229
 customization of characters within 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.300
 story campaign in black ops 2 starts 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.889
 seem like the first step is the next one 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.000
 parties call of duty should have done 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.310
 another studio 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.250
 apparently the remnants of the once mighty infinity 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.000
 ward for a moment forgot that for good 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.650
 games 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.470
 not only the new track is May 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.940
 high poly dog but good 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.480
 technological component and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.700
 anyway 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.830
 clear reason why 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.500
 shoot the bad guys except 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.790
 they are bad guys 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.050
 Of course it is worth taking into account that 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.570
 for a huge group of people call of duty 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.940
 this is first and foremost many network hours 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.650
 battles and the release of a new part of a kind 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.600
 checkpoint changing minor 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.670
 parts in the already established and proven 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.290
 years of concept and it would be possible 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.030
 logical to close eyes on problems 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.920
 single player campaign as it follows 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.300
 do in the case of a game competitor 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.790
 battlefield 4 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.680
 yes too frequent use 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.400
 phrase next-gen and huge 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.250
 ambitions 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.110
 oblige our editorial board six out of ten 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.250
 play three out of ten 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.250
 single player campaign
