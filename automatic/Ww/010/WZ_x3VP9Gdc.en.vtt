jittery<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:51.959> he's<00:03:52.530> hard<00:03:52.830> in<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.100> self-dual

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
jittery so he's hard in the self-dual

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
jittery so he's hard in the self-dual
and<00:03:53.700> some<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:54.000> those<00:03:54.090> shots<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:56.070> mean<00:03:56.640> try<00:03:57.480> it

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
and some of those shots so I mean try it

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.670 
and some of those shots so I mean try it
out<00:03:57.720> if<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.959> want<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.170> see<00:03:58.290> what<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.500> looks

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
out if you want to see what it looks

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.040 
out if you want to see what it looks
like<00:03:58.770> but<00:03:59.070> that's<00:03:59.520> gonna<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.850> like<00:04:00.060> 12<00:04:00.690> 13

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
like but that's gonna be like 12 13

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.320 
like but that's gonna be like 12 13
squad<00:04:01.739> points<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.640> blow<00:04:02.820> on<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.300> I

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
squad points to blow on that so I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.210 
squad points to blow on that so I
wouldn't<00:04:03.600> recommend<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.920> then<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.130> got

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
wouldn't recommend that and then you got

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.220 
wouldn't recommend that and then you got
the<00:04:05.340> juggernaut<00:04:05.730> Recon<00:04:06.270> so<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:06.989> would<00:04:07.140> have

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the juggernaut Recon so you would have

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.570 
the juggernaut Recon so you would have
defensive<00:04:07.800> armor<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:10.920> would<00:04:11.459> have<00:04:11.520> that

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
defensive armor so you would have that

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.280 
defensive armor so you would have that
ride<00:04:11.940> shield<00:04:12.300> if<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.540> were<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.690> drop<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.110> but

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
ride shield if you were to drop that but

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.699 
ride shield if you were to drop that but
you'd<00:04:13.440> become<00:04:13.620> one<00:04:13.950> so<00:04:14.280> that's<00:04:14.640> pretty<00:04:14.850> badass

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
you'd become one so that's pretty badass

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.890 
you'd become one so that's pretty badass
but<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.919> my<00:04:17.040> opinion<00:04:17.209> not<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.780> as

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
but in my opinion not going to be as

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.159 
but in my opinion not going to be as
clutch<00:04:19.230> as<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.970> getting<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.209> vision<00:04:21.480> call

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
clutch as just getting a vision call

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.260 
clutch as just getting a vision call
duty<00:04:22.470> ghost<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.250> about<00:04:23.520> vision<00:04:23.820> on<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
duty ghost it's all about vision on the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.600 
duty ghost it's all about vision on the
map<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.840> where<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> enemy<00:04:25.169> team<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:26.580> I

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
map and where the enemy team is so I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.310 
map and where the enemy team is so I
would<00:04:26.910> recommend<00:04:27.060> these<00:04:27.540> three<00:04:27.810> streets<00:04:28.140> if

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
would recommend these three streets if

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.140 
would recommend these three streets if
