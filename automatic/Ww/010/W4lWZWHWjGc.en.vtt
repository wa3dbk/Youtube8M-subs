the<00:01:16.260> six<00:01:25.790> doing<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.910> difference<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.420> kind<00:01:27.660> of

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the six doing the difference is kind of

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.750 
the six doing the difference is kind of
subtle<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.230> it<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.280> gives<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.730> that

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
subtle but it just gives that that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760 
subtle but it just gives that that
little<00:01:30.090> twist<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.660> makes<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> interesting<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
little twist or makes it interesting so

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
slight quarter stepping gives it some

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.340 
slight quarter stepping gives it some
grease<00:02:07.430> as<00:02:07.790> they<00:02:08.149> say<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:14.720> doing<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.110> rake

well<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.519> if<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.700> were<00:02:40.790> running<00:02:40.940> through<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
well so if you were running through the

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.940 
well so if you were running through the
scale<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.810> have<00:02:41.930> an<00:02:42.140> extra<00:02:42.380> note<00:02:42.560> you'll<00:02:42.800> be<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
scale you have an extra note you'll be a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:52.090 
scale you have an extra note you'll be a
six<00:02:43.220> note<00:02:43.400> scale<00:02:46.209> six<00:02:47.209> flat<00:02:48.019> seven<00:02:50.410> six<00:02:51.410> flat

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.440 
six note scale six flat seven six flat
seven<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:55.130> here's<00:02:55.280> an<00:02:55.370> example<00:02:55.459> lick<00:02:55.970> using

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
seven so here's an example lick using

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.800 
seven so here's an example lick using
the<00:02:56.660> sixth<00:02:57.049> combined<00:02:57.680> with<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.040> flat<00:02:58.280> seventh

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.600 

so<00:03:06.810> what<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:07.020> doing<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.470> I'm<00:03:07.650> slow<00:03:07.980> to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
so what I'm doing there is I'm slow to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.490 
so what I'm doing there is I'm slow to
play<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> little<00:03:08.970> slowly<00:03:09.570> running<00:03:10.110> down<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
play a little slowly running down the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.700 
play a little slowly running down the
scale<00:03:10.830> E<00:03:11.130> flat<00:03:12.030> C<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.140> then<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.500> look

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
scale E flat C and then here look

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.210 
scale E flat C and then here look
dramatically<00:03:14.430> B<00:03:15.240> flat<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.900> G<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.100> I've

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
dramatically B flat a G and then I've

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.600 
dramatically B flat a G and then I've
overlapped<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.760> scale<00:03:21.060> C<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.680> E<00:03:22.860> string<00:03:22.890> B

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
overlapped the scale C on the E string B

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.940 
overlapped the scale C on the E string B
flat<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.360> G<00:03:25.140> again<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:28.470> then<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.650> change

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
flat a G again and then I change

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.120 
flat a G again and then I change

the flat seven just a half step you know

the flat seven just a half step you know
so<00:04:50.290> so<00:04:51.290> again<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.860> kind<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.610> know<00:04:52.700> every

from that six to the flat and seven
you're<00:04:57.020> hitting<00:04:57.320> a<00:04:57.380> nice<00:04:57.500> chord<00:04:57.890> time<00:04:58.190> right

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
you're hitting a nice chord time right

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.030 
you're hitting a nice chord time right
because<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.419> flat<00:04:59.690> seven<00:05:00.110> B<00:05:00.320> flat<00:05:00.500> is<00:05:00.770> in

because the the flat seven B flat is in

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.770 
because the the flat seven B flat is in
the<00:05:01.160> core<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.780> most<00:05:03.020> resolution<00:05:04.660> you<00:05:05.660> know

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
the core so the most resolution you know

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.510 
the core so the most resolution you know

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.410 

there's<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:27.010> fun<00:05:27.280> backing<00:05:27.760> track<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.210> can

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
there's a fun backing track you can

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.500 
there's a fun backing track you can
practice<00:05:29.230> this<00:05:29.470> using<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.460> six<00:05:30.760> alright

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
practice this using the six alright

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.500 
practice this using the six alright
we're<00:05:31.630> gonna<00:05:31.720> switch<00:05:32.080> key<00:05:32.470> to<00:05:32.770> B<00:05:33.070> flat<00:05:33.510> seven

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
we're gonna switch key to B flat seven

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.890 
we're gonna switch key to B flat seven
okay<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.380> this<00:05:35.500> is<00:05:35.680> just<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:36.220> static<00:05:37.210> B<00:05:37.540> flat

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
okay so this is just a static B flat

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.050 
okay so this is just a static B flat

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
just came up with utilizing the sticks

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.650 
just came up with utilizing the sticks
