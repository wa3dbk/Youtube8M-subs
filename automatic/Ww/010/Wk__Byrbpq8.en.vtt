 the products sometimes annoying 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.990

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:48.969
 conquered 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.929
 but first it takes 20 years of hard work 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.099
 before this soda could be produced without chemical additives 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.909
 All ingredients are organically grown and sourced locally 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.349
 The bionade was created through the collaboration of a whole family 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.199
 better for larger companies 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.419

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:25.059
 Percent of one soft drink is produced as for 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.799
 Example also make beer

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.519
 without dissenting now 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.039
 but also with you 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.979
 that is healthier too 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.329
 The machines run around the clock 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.539
 20,000 bottles are filled per hour 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.899
 and yet the company does not make enough customers Bionade 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.619
 to deliver the newest flavor which also the 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.619
 most popular among consumers is 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.939

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.709
 Founded years ago no 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 today they sell to hundreds of thousands of bottles a year 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.900
 a nice success for the 123 employees from the panel at the same time 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.900
 decide on the development of the brand 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.220
 But right now the fact remains that none of them only from the production 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.220
 this one can live in cola 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.430

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.559

 for not much money for 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.139
 I have given one to another relative because we work every day 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.189
 that is to say, one way of trying to establish other economies 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.119
 nothing percent when I make a lot of money but went well 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:53.119
 but all others have their fair share and something new 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.740
 Domenica worried about 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.389
 The manufacturers of Premium have chosen exactly these outlets 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.310
 these are bars that happily appreciate the alternative coke 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.539
 Selling 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.539
 whether it stays that way is not know then I say learn 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.550
 first in four groups and simplifies the best 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.980
 the goal of three million 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.330
 to stand out from the multinationals that like to stay down to earth and the 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.510

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.139
 Reasons for their success 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.719
 this creative scene 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.799
 As I would like to do something different team than sure then everything in the environment 

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:34.499
 define under it such brands are simply attractive 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.549
 what is someone behind that it is different and it does not do it for Buer 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.150
 and especially 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.720
 I think that's what people are already looking for, especially that they are 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.720
 Mazen can draw personal games and 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.740
 This new sedan which was sold by consumers from approx 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.740
 Egg white unexpected reasons chosen 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.160

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.499
 that he will drink while the club has 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.499

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.240
