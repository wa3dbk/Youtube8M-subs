00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:19.740
 How does our 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:22.590
 here I have the piston 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 pain when it moves upward 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 all the marketing on the top passes 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.860
 for part of the hot side where the focus 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.760
 it goes down here 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.940
 this heat heats the air dilates inside the 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.850
 increasing engine motor internal pressure 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.340
 consequently this pressure within 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.129
 into that hole pushes a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 external toghete generating turns 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 when they move give bright white 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.019
 hot air passes through the cold side 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.780
 therefore it is cooled down to 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:04.080
 incognito of size and rise and its group 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:08.760
 are down and if the pain does not make 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 force it is simply the block of 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 bottom-up and top-down in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.630
 which air passes between this little 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.200
 They are between the engine cylinder and which 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.200
 are displaced 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.010
 already with fire 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.920
 we will go first before putting the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.710
 piston to the burning to go out every 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.310
 this smoke inside the engine 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 notice 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.600
 when they are under the skirt, smoking is the same 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.109
 to them or air into when he and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.109
 descends 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.860
 look like engine of the expression now 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.310
 we need to go up and now it's up to 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.310
 inside 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.940
 to see if the engine will run 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.880
 very well when they are displaced 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.990
 the air automatically and fill 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:18.920
 engine and also made of balloon 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.920
 fill the fill and wilt 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.410
 as we generate the crankshaft 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:23.720
 10 led fishing engine generator 7 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:55.020
 let's start ten times without 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.020
 interest
