beautiful thing about fresh fruit raw

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.750 
beautiful thing about fresh fruit raw
fruit<00:00:35.020> it<00:00:35.230> can<00:00:35.380> be<00:00:35.470> frozen<00:00:35.710> but<00:00:36.280> long<00:00:36.460> as<00:00:36.610> it's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760

modern day is very very dead food is

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.190 
modern day is very very dead food is
what<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.670> call<00:00:48.880> it<00:00:49.060> means<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.810> doesn't<00:00:50.020> have

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
what I call it means it doesn't have

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.420 
what I call it means it doesn't have
enzymes<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:51.340> it<00:00:52.180> doesn't<00:00:52.540> digest<00:00:53.110> well<00:00:53.430> back

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
enzymes and it doesn't digest well back

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.750 
enzymes and it doesn't digest well back
when<00:00:55.530> things<00:00:56.530> were<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.770> lot<00:00:57.010> fresher<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.700> they

healthy enzymes all right we're gonna

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.010 
healthy enzymes all right we're gonna
put<00:01:16.630> about<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.320> half<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.859> cup<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:18.100> fresh<00:01:18.840> mango<00:01:19.840> in

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there mangoes have some amazing enzymes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.819 
there mangoes have some amazing enzymes
when<00:01:24.340> you're<00:01:24.490> born<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.960> are<00:01:25.990> born<00:01:26.409> with<00:01:26.679> an

when you're born you are born with an
actual<00:01:27.479> stored<00:01:28.479> up<00:01:29.369> enzyme<00:01:30.369> packs<00:01:30.759> basically

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
actual stored up enzyme packs basically

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.389 
actual stored up enzyme packs basically
your<00:01:31.960> body<00:01:32.140> can<00:01:32.409> actually<00:01:32.679> produce<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
your body can actually produce the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.190 
your body can actually produce the
enzymes<00:01:33.939> but<00:01:34.450> if<00:01:35.439> we<00:01:35.859> do<00:01:36.100> not<00:01:36.310> buy<00:01:36.969> by<00:01:37.509> using<00:01:37.929> up

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
enzymes but if we do not buy by using up

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440 
enzymes but if we do not buy by using up
that<00:01:38.380> store<00:01:38.649> pack<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.670> we<00:01:39.789> do<00:01:39.909> not<00:01:39.939> have<00:01:40.389> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
that store pack but if we do not have a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.200 
that store pack but if we do not have a
good<00:01:40.899> diet<00:01:41.229> then<00:01:41.889> we<00:01:42.069> are<00:01:42.189> constantly<00:01:42.819> using

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
good diet then we are constantly using

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.929 
good diet then we are constantly using
up<00:01:43.569> that<00:01:43.600> stored<00:01:44.170> pack<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:45.159> older<00:01:45.520> we<00:01:45.729> get

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
up that stored pack and the older we get

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.629 
up that stored pack and the older we get
the<00:01:45.999> more<00:01:46.780> unhealthy<00:01:47.259> we<00:01:47.649> get<00:01:47.829> because<00:01:48.340> our

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
the more unhealthy we get because our

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.849 
the more unhealthy we get because our
body<00:01:48.909> is<00:01:49.149> basically<00:01:49.600> eating<00:01:49.899> up<00:01:50.289> all<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.679> good

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
body is basically eating up all the good

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.489 
body is basically eating up all the good
stuff<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.280> have<00:01:51.460> now<00:01:52.209> let's<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:52.689> we<00:01:52.899> got<00:01:53.109> we

stuff we have now let's see we got we
got<00:01:53.560> about<00:01:53.859> a<00:01:53.889> half<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.310> cup<00:01:54.840> there

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
got about a half of a cup there

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.989 
got about a half of a cup there
now<00:01:56.619> let's<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:58.240> raw<00:01:58.420> coconut<00:01:59.999> raw

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999
