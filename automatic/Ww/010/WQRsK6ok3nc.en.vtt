00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
much the lines I became mom if I were

mushroom<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.730> anything<00:00:41.960> so<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.250> here

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
mushroom or anything so you can see here

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.600 
mushroom or anything so you can see here
you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.670> replay<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.610> yeah

you can replay it if you want and yeah

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.830 
you can replay it if you want and yeah
this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.820> pretty<00:00:48.090> much<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> life<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.660> would

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
this is pretty much the life I would

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
this is pretty much the life I would
take<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> strategies<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.190> would<00:00:50.399> they're

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
take the strategies I would they're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.979 
take the strategies I would they're
outside<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> cake<00:00:53.210> right<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
outside the cake right here is the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
outside the cake right here is the
alternate<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.800> wear<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> when

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
alternate which we wear out this is when

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.990 
alternate which we wear out this is when
you<00:00:57.210> go<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.170> case<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.550> can't<00:00:59.820> go

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you go up here in case you you can't go

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.529 
you go up here in case you you can't go
the<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.300> way

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the other way

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.660 
the other way
it's<00:01:00.780> slower<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.520> an

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it's slower but if you really need an

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's slower but if you really need an
item<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.359> there's<00:01:03.719> two<00:01:04.010> bananas<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.159> whatever

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
item or there's two bananas or whatever

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.550 
item or there's two bananas or whatever
and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> ground<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.990> could<00:01:07.380> take

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and the ground other one we could take

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.340 
and the ground other one we could take
that<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.270> its<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.930> preferred

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that this one is on its really preferred

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
that this one is on its really preferred
but<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.000> if

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
but if you really have to go to here if

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
but if you really have to go to here if
the<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:13.049> item<00:01:13.320> boxes<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.799> other<00:01:14.010> route<00:01:14.250> are

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the two item boxes and other route are

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
the two item boxes and other route are
taking<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.299> need<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.080> yeah<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
taking you need to take just yeah and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.210 
taking you need to take just yeah and
yeah<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.240> slower

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
yeah but it's a lot slower

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.240 
yeah but it's a lot slower
right<00:01:20.060> here's<00:01:20.390> on<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.720> third<00:01:21.020> lap<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.890> don't

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
right here's on the third lap you don't

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.100 
right here's on the third lap you don't
want<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.640> trek<00:01:22.910> on<00:01:23.060> this<00:01:23.180> ramp<00:01:23.480> you<00:01:23.750> just<00:01:23.960> want

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
want to trek on this ramp you just want

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.510 
want to trek on this ramp you just want
to<00:01:24.170> wheel<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.530> over<00:01:24.620> it<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.040> it's<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.280> lot

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
to wheel it over it and it's a lot

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.510 
to wheel it over it and it's a lot
faster<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:26.570> might<00:01:26.900> if<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:27.800> a<00:01:27.890> close<00:01:28.100> race<00:01:28.130> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
faster it might if it's a close race it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.190 
faster it might if it's a close race it
might<00:01:28.700> let<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:28.940> pass<00:01:29.180> something<00:01:29.450> right

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
might let you pass something right

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.950 
might let you pass something right

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.340 
you're gonna respond from the other side
of<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.160> course<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.000> lot<00:01:50.300> faster<00:01:50.540> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
of the course so it's a lot faster and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.200 
of the course so it's a lot faster and
that<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.160> can<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:52.460> in<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> finish<00:01:52.940> on<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
that you can see in a finish on this

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.630 
that you can see in a finish on this
it's<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.480> lot<00:01:53.600> faster<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.590> way<00:01:54.830> if<00:01:55.490> you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
it's a lot faster this is the way if you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.970 
it's a lot faster this is the way if you

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
don't stop I'll show you in slow motion

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.250 
don't stop I'll show you in slow motion
how<00:01:58.310> are<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.550> do<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:58.910> right<00:01:59.600> before<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.080> go

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
how are you do that right before you go

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.760 
how are you do that right before you go
up<00:02:00.440> there<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:01.070> course<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.790> just<00:02:02.150> really<00:02:03.110> you

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
up there of course you just really you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.560 
up there of course you just really you
should<00:02:04.010> land<00:02:04.250> over<00:02:04.550> there<00:02:04.640> quickly<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.330> then

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
respond all the way over there so you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.940 
respond all the way over there so you
cut<00:02:08.149> along<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:11.350> what<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.710> had<00:02:12.920> a

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
on tape and then you can use it speed up

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.199 
on tape and then you can use it speed up
and<00:02:24.230> then<00:02:24.590> pick<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.890> shortcut<00:02:25.459> Janet<00:02:26.060> for

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
and then pick the shortcut Janet for

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.300 
and then pick the shortcut Janet for
mass<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.810> burn<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.290> which<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:27.800> beautiful

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
mass to burn it which was just beautiful

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.910 
mass to burn it which was just beautiful
right<00:02:29.239> here's<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.630> rock<00:02:29.900> hop<00:02:30.170> short<00:02:30.470> cop<00:02:30.680> this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
right here's the rock hop short cop this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.410 
right here's the rock hop short cop this
is<00:02:31.070> if<00:02:31.190> you're<00:02:31.340> going<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.520> stop<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.940> game<00:02:32.150> it's

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
is if you're going to stop and game it's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.420 
is if you're going to stop and game it's
a<00:02:32.540> pretty<00:02:32.750> hard<00:02:33.080> shortcut<00:02:33.680> even<00:02:34.070> if<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.250> do

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
a pretty hard shortcut even if you do

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.160 
a pretty hard shortcut even if you do
aim<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.330> should<00:02:35.540> get<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> hang<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:36.050> it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
aim but you should get the hang of it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.940 
aim but you should get the hang of it
eventually

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
eventually

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.229 
eventually
if<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.160> aim<00:02:37.400> light<00:02:37.580> where<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.820> arrow<00:02:37.970> was

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
if you aim light where the arrow was

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.120 
if you aim light where the arrow was
kneeling<00:02:38.690> over<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.140> with<00:02:39.260> lenses<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:39.950> on

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
kneeling over there with lenses going on

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.540 
kneeling over there with lenses going on
so<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:40.880> really<00:02:40.940> fast<00:02:42.010> right<00:02:43.010> where<00:02:43.310> you're

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
so it's really fast right where you're

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.479 
so it's really fast right where you're
not<00:02:44.000> going<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.600> stop<00:02:44.989> it's<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.590> lot<00:02:45.800> harder<00:02:46.130> but

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
not going to stop it's a lot harder but

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.300 
not going to stop it's a lot harder but
it's<00:02:46.670> definitely<00:02:47.570> beneficial<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.980> move

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it's definitely beneficial and you move

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.830 
it's definitely beneficial and you move
there<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.580> did<00:02:49.880> go<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.180> mud<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> little<00:02:50.480> bit

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
there I did go in the mud a little bit

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.690 
there I did go in the mud a little bit
but<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.769> aim<00:02:51.950> yourself<00:02:52.280> right<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.550> don't

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
but if you aim yourself right you don't

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.300 
but if you aim yourself right you don't
