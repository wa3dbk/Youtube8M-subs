00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.770 

after<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.710> rolled<00:00:08.130> across<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.550> Atlantic<00:00:09.090> Ocean

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
after I rolled across the Atlantic Ocean

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.330 
after I rolled across the Atlantic Ocean
I<00:00:09.809> was<00:00:09.990> looking<00:00:10.320> for<00:00:10.530> something<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:11.219> know

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I was looking for something you know

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.759 
I was looking for something you know
some<00:00:11.610> challenge<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.780> more<00:00:13.170> adventurous

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
some challenge that is more adventurous

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.960 
some challenge that is more adventurous
and<00:00:14.839> its<00:00:15.839> little<00:00:16.529> bit<00:00:16.680> more<00:00:17.010> action<00:00:17.250> involved

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and its little bit more action involved

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.480 
and its little bit more action involved
in<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.990> didn't<00:00:19.529> know<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.010> thing<00:00:20.070> about

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
in it so I didn't know a thing about

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.210 
in it so I didn't know a thing about
higher<00:00:20.910> speed<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.140> seems<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.710> perfect

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
higher speed but it seems like perfect

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.060 
higher speed but it seems like perfect
things<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:24.420> pick<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> decided<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.740> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
things to pick up so I decided that I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640 
things to pick up so I decided that I
will<00:00:26.250> swim<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.420> length<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> Sochi<00:00:28.320> river

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
will swim the length of the Sochi river

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.880 
will swim the length of the Sochi river
with<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.750> basically<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> piece<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.320> plastic

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
with this basically a piece of plastic

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.370 
with this basically a piece of plastic
that<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.730> hold<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> protects<00:00:34.260> you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that you can hold on to and protects you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.320 
that you can hold on to and protects you
from<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:35.040> rocks

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.840 

so<00:00:42.870> terrier<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> most<00:00:44.310> beautiful

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so terrier is one of the most beautiful

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.450 
so terrier is one of the most beautiful
rivers<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.450> Europe<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.860> made<00:00:47.130> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
rivers in Europe so it made a lot of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.320 
rivers in Europe so it made a lot of
sense<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.150> I<00:00:48.450> would<00:00:48.690> spin<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.330> I've

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
sense that I would spin this one I've

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.530 
sense that I would spin this one I've
never<00:00:51.630> been<00:00:51.840> kayaking<00:00:52.410> from<00:00:53.330> socha

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
never been kayaking from socha

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.340 
never been kayaking from socha
so<00:00:54.720> it<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.470> new<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.220> me<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.450> torso<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:58.110> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so it it's new to me and the torso was a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
so it it's new to me and the torso was a
little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:58.890> bigger<00:00:59.100> challenge<00:00:59.610> it's<00:01:00.510> really

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
little bit bigger challenge it's really

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
little bit bigger challenge it's really
out<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> my<00:01:01.290> comfort<00:01:01.680> zone<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.879> also

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
out of my comfort zone and that's also

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
out of my comfort zone and that's also
the<00:01:03.300> reason<00:01:03.480> why<00:01:03.900> I'm<00:01:04.080> doing<00:01:04.410> it<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.460> let<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the reason why I'm doing it so let that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:45.670 
the reason why I'm doing it so let that
venture<00:01:06.600> begin

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.570 

I<00:01:45.710> just<00:01:46.220> have<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.640> walk<00:01:46.850> 200<00:01:47.750> meters<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:49.400> this

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
I just have to walk 200 meters of this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.480 
I just have to walk 200 meters of this
stretch<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.390> river<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:51.020> too<00:01:51.260> dangerous

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
stretch of the river just too dangerous

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.400 
stretch of the river just too dangerous
