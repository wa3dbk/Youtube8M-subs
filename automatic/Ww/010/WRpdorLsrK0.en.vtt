00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
pops up here asking me for the end time

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.660 
pops up here asking me for the end time
step<00:03:14.660> size<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.350> on<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.250> I'm<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.580> to

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
step size and so on and I'm going to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.150 
step size and so on and I'm going to
turn<00:03:16.940> on<00:03:17.170> sliders<00:03:18.170> here

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.010 

so<00:03:22.160> there's<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.750> simple<00:03:23.750> simulation

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.240 

now<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.650> sliders<00:03:29.870> allows<00:03:30.870> me<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.290> change<00:03:31.950> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
now the sliders allows me to change the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.920 
now the sliders allows me to change the
value<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:35.460> different<00:03:35.940> parameters<00:03:36.210> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
value of different parameters and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.880 
value of different parameters and
actually<00:03:37.440> observe<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:40.260> change<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
actually observe the change in the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:52.090 
actually observe the change in the
simulation

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.060 

now<00:03:52.700> let's<00:03:52.910> construct<00:03:53.210> so<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.620> results<00:03:55.010> of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
now let's construct so the results of

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.010 
now let's construct so the results of
the<00:03:55.220> simulation<00:03:55.400> are<00:03:55.880> also<00:03:56.030> printed<00:03:56.750> on<00:03:56.900> the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
the simulation are also printed on the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.290 
the simulation are also printed on the
screen<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:58.100> can<00:03:58.130> press<00:03:58.520> escape<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:58.940> clear

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
screen and I can press escape to clear

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.380 
screen and I can press escape to clear
it<00:03:59.860> now<00:04:00.860> let's<00:04:01.040> construct<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.580> simple<00:04:01.970> genetic

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
it now let's construct a simple genetic

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.320 
it now let's construct a simple genetic
network<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:04.010> I'm<00:04:04.130> going<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.430> put<00:04:04.550> our<00:04:04.700> coding

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
network so I'm going to put our coding

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.750 
network so I'm going to put our coding
sequence<00:04:06.050> on<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.350> screen<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.890> then<00:04:07.580> an

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
sequence on the screen and then an

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.870 
sequence on the screen and then an
inducible<00:04:08.270> promoter<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.200> then<00:04:10.190> go<00:04:10.850> to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
inducible promoter and then go to

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.470 
inducible promoter and then go to
reactions<00:04:11.630> click<00:04:11.960> on<00:04:12.140> 121<00:04:12.920> click<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:14.000> coding

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
reactions click on 121 click on coding

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.280 
reactions click on 121 click on coding
and<00:04:14.690> then<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.020> screen<00:04:15.410> so<00:04:17.140> Tigers<00:04:18.140> will

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and then the screen so Tigers will

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.830 
and then the screen so Tigers will
automatically<00:04:18.890> recognize<00:04:19.010> this<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.570> a

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
automatically recognize this is that a

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.680 
automatically recognize this is that a
protein<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.770> made<00:04:21.800> from<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.640> coding<00:04:23.000> segment<00:04:23.420> so

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
protein is made from a coding segment so

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.710 
protein is made from a coding segment so
it<00:04:24.350> recognizes<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.250> fact<00:04:25.370> that<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:26.540> know

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
it recognizes the fact that you know

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.040 
it recognizes the fact that you know
this<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:28.100> again<00:04:28.400> we<00:04:28.730> can<00:04:28.910> type<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.840> name

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
this is a so again we can type the name

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.270 
this is a so again we can type the name
of<00:04:30.200> this<00:04:30.350> work<00:04:30.590> PP<00:04:31.220> 1<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:33.260> recognizes<00:04:33.650> this

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
of this work PP 1 and it recognizes this

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.110 
of this work PP 1 and it recognizes this
as<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.580> protein<00:04:35.180> production<00:04:35.540> reaction<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:38.000> it

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
as a protein production reaction and it

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.810 
as a protein production reaction and it
shows<00:04:38.300> again<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.780> stoichiometry<00:04:39.020> end<00:04:39.820> rates

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
shows again the stoichiometry end rates

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.610 
shows again the stoichiometry end rates
so<00:04:41.420> currently<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.290> rate<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:43.670> constant

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
so currently the rate is just constant

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.960 
so currently the rate is just constant
so<00:04:45.620> if<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.800> double-click<00:04:46.130> it's<00:04:46.520> just<00:04:46.850> a

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
so if I double-click it's just a

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.510 
so if I double-click it's just a
constant<00:04:47.920> if<00:04:48.920> I<00:04:49.160> put<00:04:49.430> this<00:04:49.550> promoter<00:04:50.030> here

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
constant if I put this promoter here

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.529 
constant if I put this promoter here
and<00:04:51.610> then<00:04:52.210> if<00:04:52.569> i<00:04:52.750> add<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> regulation<00:04:53.740> let's<00:04:54.009> see

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
and then if i add a regulation let's see

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.390 
and then if i add a regulation let's see
transcription<00:04:55.539> activation<00:04:56.199> well<00:04:57.069> it's<00:04:57.250> an

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
transcription activation well it's an

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.089 
transcription activation well it's an
inducible<00:04:57.729> promoter<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:58.660> i<00:04:58.900> have<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.710> activate

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
inducible promoter so i have to activate

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.600 
inducible promoter so i have to activate
it<00:05:00.280> now<00:05:00.750> if<00:05:01.750> some<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.169> these<00:05:02.319> regulations<00:05:03.310> are

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
it now if some of these regulations are

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
screen it creates a transcription

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.999 
screen it creates a transcription
regulation<00:05:23.310> now<00:05:24.310> if<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.729> look<00:05:24.759> at<00:05:25.180> this

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
regulation now if I look at this

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.059 
regulation now if I look at this
reaction<00:05:27.009> rate<00:05:27.190> notice<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.090> tinker<00:05:28.389> Salas

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
reaction rate notice that tinker Salas

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.390 
reaction rate notice that tinker Salas
edited<00:05:30.069> this<00:05:30.220> reaction<00:05:30.880> rate<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.419> that<00:05:31.449> it's<00:05:31.930> a

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
edited this reaction rate so that it's a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.790 
edited this reaction rate so that it's a
function<00:05:33.400> of<00:05:33.759> the<00:05:34.539> hyperbolic<00:05:35.050> function<00:05:35.650> of

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
function of the hyperbolic function of

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.680 
function of the hyperbolic function of
the<00:05:36.580> transcription<00:05:37.509> factor<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.380> if<00:05:39.009> I<00:05:39.690> change

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
the transcription factor and if I change

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.930 
the transcription factor and if I change
the<00:05:41.319> parameter<00:05:42.069> in<00:05:42.190> this<00:05:42.340> transcription

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
the parameter in this transcription

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.120 
the parameter in this transcription
factor<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.870> hill<00:05:44.050> coefficient<00:05:44.229> to<00:05:44.770> say<00:05:44.979> four

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
factor the hill coefficient to say four

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.939 
factor the hill coefficient to say four
then<00:05:48.659> this<00:05:49.659> is<00:05:49.870> going<00:05:50.050> to<00:05:50.169> be<00:05:50.289> a<00:05:50.319> sigmoid

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
then this is going to be a sigmoid

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.220 
then this is going to be a sigmoid
function

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.610 

and<00:05:55.230> again<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.620> can<00:05:55.800> simulate<00:05:56.100> this<00:05:57.320> let's<00:05:58.320> turn

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
and again I can simulate this let's turn

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.760 
and again I can simulate this let's turn
off<00:05:58.650> sliders<00:05:59.310> for<00:05:59.760> this<00:06:00.000> one<00:06:00.410> and<00:06:01.410> you'll<00:06:01.560> see

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
off sliders for this one and you'll see

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.440 
off sliders for this one and you'll see
well<00:06:02.190> since<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.670> protein<00:06:03.030> is<00:06:03.150> not<00:06:03.270> getting

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
well since the protein is not getting

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.380 
well since the protein is not getting
degraded<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:04.290> keeps<00:06:04.710> building<00:06:05.010> up<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.520> in

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
degraded it keeps building up and in

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.840 
degraded it keeps building up and in
this<00:06:06.510> plotting<00:06:07.170> window<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.620> can<00:06:07.860> turn<00:06:08.340> off<00:06:08.550> any

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
this plotting window I can turn off any

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.560 
this plotting window I can turn off any
of<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:10.430> any<00:06:11.430> of<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.730> items<00:06:11.850> that<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.300> don't

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
of the any of the items that I don't

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.830 
of the any of the items that I don't
want<00:06:12.720> to<00:06:12.900> see<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.730> can<00:06:14.910> choose<00:06:15.120> log<00:06:15.480> scale

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
want to see and I can choose log scale

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.830 
want to see and I can choose log scale
change<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.980> colors<00:06:17.310> and<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:17.700> on<00:06:17.850> now<00:06:18.600> I<00:06:18.630> can

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
change the colors and so on now I can

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.600 
change the colors and so on now I can
also<00:06:18.960> choose<00:06:19.830> to<00:06:19.890> keep<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.700> previous<00:06:21.120> graph

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
also choose to keep the previous graph

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.310 
also choose to keep the previous graph
so<00:06:23.610> if<00:06:23.730> I<00:06:23.850> keep<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.390> previous<00:06:24.810> graph<00:06:25.050> what

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
so if I keep the previous graph what

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.580 
so if I keep the previous graph what
will<00:06:25.530> happen<00:06:25.890> is<00:06:26.160> let<00:06:26.640> me<00:06:26.790> add<00:06:26.970> a<00:06:27.590> degradation

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
will happen is let me add a degradation

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.040 
will happen is let me add a degradation
term<00:06:29.490> here<00:06:31.430> so<00:06:32.430> degradation<00:06:33.060> and<00:06:33.840> then

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
term here so degradation and then

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:41.570 
term here so degradation and then
reaction<00:06:38.570> let's<00:06:39.570> simulate<00:06:40.100> so<00:06:41.100> when<00:06:41.250> I<00:06:41.280> kept

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
reaction let's simulate so when I kept

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.520 
reaction let's simulate so when I kept
the<00:06:41.730> previous<00:06:42.120> graph<00:06:42.360> it<00:06:42.720> obviously<00:06:43.230> then

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
the previous graph it obviously then

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.920 
the previous graph it obviously then
delete<00:06:44.430> the<00:06:44.580> old<00:06:44.670> graphic<00:06:45.090> kept<00:06:45.330> both<00:06:45.570> of<00:06:45.750> them

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
delete the old graphic kept both of them

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.870 
delete the old graphic kept both of them
so<00:06:46.380> there's<00:06:46.590> the<00:06:46.830> new<00:06:46.980> breath<00:06:47.280> with

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
so there's the new breath with

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.060 
so there's the new breath with
degradation<00:06:48.300> as<00:06:48.750> you<00:06:49.350> can<00:06:49.470> see<00:06:49.620> protein

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
degradation as you can see protein

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.180 
degradation as you can see protein
doesn't<00:06:50.340> build<00:06:50.520> up<00:06:50.700> and<00:06:51.500> append<00:06:52.500> to<00:06:52.740> current

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
doesn't build up and append to current

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.380 
doesn't build up and append to current
graph<00:06:53.490> what<00:06:53.850> that<00:06:54.060> does<00:06:54.270> is<00:06:54.620> if<00:06:55.620> I<00:06:56.090> simulate<00:06:57.090> it

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
graph what that does is if I simulate it

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.040 
graph what that does is if I simulate it
will<00:06:57.570> actually

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.779 

draw<00:07:02.009> on<00:07:02.280> top<00:07:02.669> of<00:07:02.879> the<00:07:03.030> current<00:07:03.330> graph<00:07:04.460> so<00:07:05.460> drew

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
draw on top of the current graph so drew

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:25.010 
draw on top of the current graph so drew
on<00:07:05.970> top<00:07:06.270> of<00:07:06.539> this<00:07:07.159> this<00:07:08.159> graph<00:07:08.430> here

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:32.900 

now<00:07:25.560> I<00:07:25.590> can<00:07:25.770> also<00:07:25.919> color<00:07:26.370> some<00:07:26.699> of<00:07:26.849> these<00:07:26.970> items

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.970 

you
