00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
which is the 1.75 inch from boss sent to

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.299 
which is the 1.75 inch from boss sent to
the<00:00:36.179> ball<00:00:36.390> center<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.039> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the ball center and then there is the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.239 
the ball center and then there is the
two-inch<00:00:39.120> lightweight<00:00:39.780> arm<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.859> you<00:00:41.100> can

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
two-inch lightweight arm which you can

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.729 
two-inch lightweight arm which you can
see<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.609> a<00:00:42.120> slight<00:00:42.539> different<00:00:42.929> shadings<00:00:43.530> over

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
see is a slight different shadings over

here<00:00:44.809> let's<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.140> other<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.679> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
here let's take these other two out of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
here let's take these other two out of
the<00:00:46.859> picture<00:00:47.069> and<00:00:47.569> talk<00:00:48.569> about<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> short<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the picture and talk about the short the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.419 
the picture and talk about the short the
short<00:00:51.300> arm<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:52.170> basically<00:00:52.620> two<00:00:52.859> halves<00:00:53.159> that

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
short arm is basically two halves that

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.270 
short arm is basically two halves that
are<00:00:53.519> exactly<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> same<00:00:54.739> these<00:00:55.739> plastic

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
are exactly the same these plastic

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.399 
are exactly the same these plastic
pieces<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.729> edge<00:00:56.909> with<00:00:57.479> a<00:00:57.539> bolt<00:00:57.809> breakthrough

and timing not supposed to be intent on
this<00:01:01.440> design<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.429> is<00:01:02.629> let's<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.929> fool<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
this design here is let's get a fool is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.469 
this design here is let's get a fool is
to<00:01:05.549> connect<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.390> inch<00:01:06.540> ball<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.799> on

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
to connect to a one inch ball here on

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.139 
to connect to a one inch ball here on
listeners<00:01:09.479> off<00:01:09.719> and<00:01:10.159> then<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.759> something

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
listeners off and then with something

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.700 
listeners off and then with something
else<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.540> another<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.110> inch<00:01:13.259> ball<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
else with another one inch ball in the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
else with another one inch ball in the
other<00:01:13.860> end<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
other end I'm going to just get a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
other end I'm going to just get a
diamond<00:01:15.570> plate<00:01:15.930> which<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.170> probably<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.590> most

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
diamond plate which is probably the most

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.450 
diamond plate which is probably the most
standard<00:01:17.539> setup<00:01:18.539> as<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.799> tighten<00:01:20.039> this<00:01:20.280> up

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
standard setup as you tighten this up

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.870 
standard setup as you tighten this up
you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.979> knob<00:01:23.219> here<00:01:23.250> tightens

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you can see the this knob here tightens

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.069 
you can see the this knob here tightens
up<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.619> Claire<00:01:26.490> pump<00:01:26.789> to<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.210> 21<00:01:27.630> inch

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
up and you Claire pump to these 21 inch

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.800 
up and you Claire pump to these 21 inch
balls<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.829> giving<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.299> ability<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
balls here giving you the ability to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.779 
balls here giving you the ability to
hold<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.350> Titan<00:01:31.859> place<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.430> around<00:01:32.609> these

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
hold this Titan place here around these

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.560 
hold this Titan place here around these
two<00:01:33.000> balls<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> ball<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> socket

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
two balls what is ball and socket

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
two balls what is ball and socket
connection<00:01:36.570> also<00:01:36.719> does<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.200> def<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.619> any<00:01:37.740> shop

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
connection also does is def in any shop

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
connection also does is def in any shop
that<00:01:38.369> might<00:01:38.520> come<00:01:38.789> up<00:01:39.109> the<00:01:40.109> mountain<00:01:40.560> heading

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that might come up the mountain heading

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
that might come up the mountain heading
over<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.369> your<00:01:41.520> electronic<00:01:42.060> device<00:01:42.359> so<00:01:43.259> this

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
over to your electronic device so this

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.959 
over to your electronic device so this
diamond<00:01:43.799> play<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.189> would<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.460> connect<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
diamond play here would then connect to

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.050 
diamond play here would then connect to
and<00:01:45.119> cradle<00:01:45.920> directly<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.159> bat<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and cradle directly to the bat but this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
and cradle directly to the bat but this
is<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.479> shorter<00:01:48.899> arm<00:01:49.079> application<00:01:50.009> rather

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
is just a shorter arm application rather

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.020 
is just a shorter arm application rather
than<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.789> 3<00:01:51.359> inch<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> navarrete<00:01:52.700> 1.75<00:01:53.700> inch

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
than the 3 inch of navarrete 1.75 inch

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.480 
than the 3 inch of navarrete 1.75 inch
length<00:01:54.840> between<00:01:55.229> ball<00:01:55.740> center<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.280> ball

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
length between ball center to ball

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
length between ball center to ball
center<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.960> makes<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.350> bit

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
center so it just makes a little bit

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.310 
center so it just makes a little bit
smaller<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.249> need<00:02:00.149> amount<00:02:00.539> if<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
smaller and need amount if that's the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080 
smaller and need amount if that's the
length<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> need<00:02:01.890> generally<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> lot<00:02:02.999> of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
length you need generally a lot of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.179 
length you need generally a lot of
people<00:02:03.210> use<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.749> on<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.320> motorcycle<00:02:04.799> because

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
people use this on a motorcycle because

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.880 
people use this on a motorcycle because
it's<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.450> shorter<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.960> better<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.530> most

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it's the the shorter is better in most

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.839 
it's the the shorter is better in most
most<00:02:08.280> cases<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.910> that's<00:02:09.840> how<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.500> ram<00:02:11.069> wrap

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
most cases but that's how a ram wrap

that's<00:02:29.560> tight<00:02:29.920> exact<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.850> can<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.450> apples

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
that's tight exact so you can see apples

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.710 
that's tight exact so you can see apples
apples<00:02:32.640> there<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.270> can<00:02:34.450> see

apples there you have it you can see
these<00:02:34.959> two<00:02:35.200> here<00:02:35.620> are<00:02:36.130> practically<00:02:36.880> identical

these two here are practically identical
except<00:02:38.440> for<00:02:38.530> material<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:41.350> can<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.250> that

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
except for material you can see that

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.940 
except for material you can see that
there<00:02:43.080> it's<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.350> being<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> aluminum

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
there it's going to being the aluminum

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.050 
there it's going to being the aluminum
this<00:02:45.160> one<00:02:45.340> being<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.640> plastic<00:02:46.390> composite<00:02:47.040> but

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this one being the plastic composite but

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.729 
this one being the plastic composite but
ideally<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.390> ever<00:02:49.630> since<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.170> word<00:02:50.380> this

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
short arm is as good as the aluminum

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.560 
short arm is as good as the aluminum
with<00:02:54.220> its<00:02:54.370> strength<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.030> with<00:02:55.420> its

with its strength and with its

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.710 
with its strength and with its
durability<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:57.010> they<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.000> rap<00:02:58.270> dash

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
durability so they have it the rap dash

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.810 
durability so they have it the rap dash
