00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 welcome to motocard.com the area 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.069
 geyser is the range sports helmet 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.800
 average of arai but as it usually happens 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.450
 with the helmets of this Japanese brand in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.429
 the benefits of this helmet nothing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.660
 they have to envy those of others 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.660
 Top-end helmets 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.270
 before starting to analyze the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 composition of the shell or 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.950
 external structure of the raider zeiser v 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.070
 we must highlight the pattern of 75 by the 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.559
 which the rounding angle of the hull and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.519
 of all helmets saray never exceeds 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 of 75 degrees this helps to disperse 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.210
 efficiently the kinetic energy in 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.470
 case of an eventual blow or fall 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 likewise all the components or 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.230
 accessories that we found in the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 outer shell have been designed 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.670
 to detach in case of an eventual 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.590
 impact and thus offer this angle 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 rounding that helps as we have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.090
 commented to efficiently disperse the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280
 kinetic energy are we going now to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.130
 comment the composition of the shell the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.020
 external structure of the helmet a shell 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.420
 that uses the laminated wta surface 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.299
 and then inside this shell 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.750
 we found a multiple density ep s 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:28.149
 all this helps to offer a great 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.880
 rigidity and a great hardness of the helmet that 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.929
 yes the weight is somewhat higher than others 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.899
 mid-range competition helmets 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.079
 60 for the scale in 2000 550 grams 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.990
 approximately that the form 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.610
 rounded organic hull allows or 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.649
 balances the weights of it so that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.939
 once we wear it we will not notice 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.849
 these 1,500 50 grams in our head 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.720
 it will seem like a much more helmet 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:03.789
 light we are going to talk now about the system 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.060
 of helmet ventilation because it is a 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.759
 helmet that you have apart from this entrance 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.040
 front located on the chin bar that is 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.020
 of three positions that helps disperse 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 the fog inside the screen 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.350
 and it also helps to provide a flow 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.730
 of air in the face of the pilot of 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.710
 user 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.950
 we found a main entrance 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.910
 located in the upper front part of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.700
 the three-position shell closed / 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.580
 open and open and then the air is re 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.460
 driven by nps pipelines 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.130
 inside the helmet until the air 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.950
 find your way out 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.490
 taking advantage of the rear spoiler of 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.490
 geyser and opening mechanism and 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.550
 Close is in the same spoiler 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.920
 of the helmet 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.500
 and you also have to comment 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.440
 these eyebrow openings as flame the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.990
 brand aray 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.190
 in which we also find some 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.740
 air intakes 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.650
 and through these channelings that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.120
 we find here also help and 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.620
 optimize the air flow in the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.620
 inside of it these openings 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.750
 take advantage of the helmet screen to not 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.450
 have to create more holes in the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.000
 structure thus improving the rigidity of the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.050
 helmet in terms of helmet screen 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.380
 this one possesses offers 5 more millimeters of 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.230
 visual field can incorporate the blade 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.819
 anti-fog pin lock and in fact comes from 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.129
 series with this helmet 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.849
 as for the mechanism of the screen yes 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.590
 is we raise it to the limit until 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.900
 above all we will see that it excels 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 a tab on the mechanism of the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.590
 screen by activating this tab 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.510
 we can extract easily and without 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.120
 need for tools the screen 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.400
 of the helmet and other characteristics 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.190
 of the screen is this perimeter rubber 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.700
 what do we find 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.890
 in the vision hole that assures us 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.490
 a great isolation in the interior and 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.230
 this translates into a great 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.110
 soundproofing that is one of the 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.810
 essential characteristics of the geyser 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.880
 the absence of noise inside the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.190
 helmet 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.990
 we have also commented on this mechanism 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.820
 of the screen that allows us to extract it 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.750
 no need for tools is called 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.249
 the ever really system and if we go to the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.979
 helmet interiors 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.649
 the foams that are replaceable and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.029
 Washable offer us great comfort and 

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:45.209
 Great ergonomics adapt 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:47.249
 perfectly to our physiognomy 

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:48.719
 thanks to the facial with thor system that is 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.549
 a system by which the foams 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:54.679
 act as dock adapting 

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:57.959
 perfectly to the facial contour in addition 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:05:01.649
 In addition to adapting, they also absorb 

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:04.940
 vibrations when we go on they are 

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:07.280
 pleasant to the touch are very comfortable 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.530
 and we have already said that they are replaceable and 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.230
 washable as other characteristics of the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.350
 helmet we found the 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.080
 the double buckle closure that has 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.690
 this helmet the most sporting the one that we 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.480
 allows to enter circuit as all 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.030
 the products saray the 6 the v has 5 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.220
 years of warranty and comment that the 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.730
 graphics can be a few colors 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.620
 solid basic bases that marry 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.480
 perfectly with our bike with 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.240
 our motorcycle or with our our 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.190
 equipment or graphics like 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.370
 this one we have a replica of kevin 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.380
 schwantz pepsi to accentuate a little more 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.710
 sportsmanship or that profile more 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.650
 sports that we can have summarizing 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.270
 the araichi be uve is the alternative or 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.760
 that opportunity that the 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.390
 amateurs to the Japanese brand of owning 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.850
 an aray product with all the quality of 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.450
 this brand and with the sports genes of 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.130
 a top range helmet any doubt 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.370
 or comment you can leave in this 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.370
