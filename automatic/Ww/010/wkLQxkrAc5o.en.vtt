running up through right here and this
is<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.739> spark<00:00:38.070> plug

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
is the spark plug

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.830 
is the spark plug
okay<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.500> engine<00:00:40.980> actually<00:00:41.550> had<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.570> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
okay this engine actually had on this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.790 
okay this engine actually had on this
bracket<00:00:43.140> right<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
bracket right here

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
bracket right here
it<00:00:44.250> had<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> ek<00:00:44.850> magneto<00:00:45.329> mounted<00:00:45.690> FB<00:00:45.930> under<00:00:46.079> but

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it had a ek magneto mounted FB under but

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
it had a ek magneto mounted FB under but
it's<00:00:46.350> gone<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.489> bad<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's gone it was bad it's got one of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's gone it was bad it's got one of
them<00:00:48.780> drive<00:00:49.530> pins<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.160> wore<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.180> anyways

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
them drive pins it's wore out so anyways

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.689 
them drive pins it's wore out so anyways
we're<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> start<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> engine<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.399> here

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
we're going to start the engine up here

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.540 
we're going to start the engine up here
and<00:00:53.910> talking<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.379> new<00:00:55.590> gas<00:00:55.890> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and talking about this your new gas you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.479 
and talking about this your new gas you
should<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:58.170> site<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.920> smell<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
should be here an on site to smell the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.110 
should be here an on site to smell the
bad<00:00:59.789> gas<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.870> tank<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.370> it's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
bad gas in this tank it's just it's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.190 
bad gas in this tank it's just it's
awful<00:01:04.700> anyways<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.570> got<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> spark

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
awful anyways then we got that spark

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
awful anyways then we got that spark
plug<00:01:07.409> traced<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.920> remember<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> your

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
plug traced out remember that to your
