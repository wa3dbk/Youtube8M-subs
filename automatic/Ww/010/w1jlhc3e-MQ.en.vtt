00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.840
 we are back and I want 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.760
 thank you to stay with us 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.110
 here in seasoning that right now we are going to 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.190
 make our delicious dessert that 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.180
 surely there are all here we are 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.000
 making gluten-free brownies this recipe 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.949
 I chose it because there are really few 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.990
 recipes that do not have gluten and is 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.320
 important to have this kind of network of not 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.750
 of access because there are many people who 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.769
 if they are intolerant to the protein of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.510
 cereal then sometimes to the 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.739
 ingredients in this recipe do not have 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.739
 cottage we will use 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.620
 225 grams of butter in cubes 100 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.160
 grams of chopped chocolate a cup of 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.579
 sugar icing 4 yolks 1 spoonful 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 vanilla essence also a cup and 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.320
 half of flour without gluten or flour 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.949
 of rice also a cup of sparks 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.430
 chocolate and 4 egg whites for your purpose too 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.950
 I recommend that you preheat the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.869
 180 degree centigrade oven 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.619
 temperature that will be maintained during 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.600
 the cooking good here I already have my already 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.759
 My pan was hot, I 'm going to 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.770
 add butter water is so that 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.399
 do not burn like chocolate health 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.869
 dad and the chocolate and I'm going to put them to 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.580
 melt let's take take here to 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.500
 leslie 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.510
 and I'm going to start separating yes exactly 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.590
 where is my trash can then 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:41.000
 approach the la la la la la ok what are we going to 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.710
 do let's put here the clear ones of the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.710
 ok egg 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.100
 and later 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.100
 then to split the egg when the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.210
 egg is cold here the yolks ok when 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.540
 something to be cold is not easy 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.450
 separate them ok in the eggs should 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.080
 keep in the refrigerator there are many 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.460
 people who do not keep them in the fridge 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.910
 put in some containers outside the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 refrigerator and this is not good the egg 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.360
 if it should be kept in refrigeration and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.910
 you should also wash a lot of people 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.700
 he does not wash it either and I do not know if he ever 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.459
 he has touched an egg with 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.129
 with cake outside there are three awards 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.920
 hen has not touched them or with a 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.140
 pen stuck 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.530
 you have to wash them imagine thumping the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.569
 egg and that a particle of the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:41.620
 waste animal waste east 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.930
 As I can tell you, it is not very healthy 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.190
 if you imagine for everyone like that and then you 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 the infections come 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.990
 you start to come out feathers and then 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.660
 We started singing pine puppy 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.730
 chick good then I'll start to 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.220
 beat my egg whites to the point of nougat there 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.380
 I'll leave them, I'll check Kim and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.440
 chocolate remember that it is important 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.240
 Do not leave it to the direct fire she- wolf 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.090
 you do not have to measure or make water 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.840
 in a bain-marie because chocolate is 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.099
 burning quickie now I'm going to add 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.099
 the icing sugar 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.580
 to my recipe 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.120
 to see but as I already have already measured 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.470
 is measured that you pass sugar icing 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.300
 let's do it with this 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.250
 and secure tsc accounts in the voice 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.250
 right now 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.250
 1,300,000 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.180
 and I know that I have several 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.720
 let's mix 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.050
 to incorporate everything 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.640
 I'm going to take it out of the fire and I'm going to add 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.640
 the buds first half 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.670
 to incorporate 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.790
 and then the other half to incorporate and without 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.620
 stop beating yes or no 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.890
 Of course we are not going to add vanilla 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.840
 equally here it is incorporated now if not 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.299
 they like the vanilla flavor can 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.849
 add orange liqueur 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.180
 he is rich, they did not like it and we are going to go 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.710
 adding in the flour little by little I 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.720
 I'm giving some glasses with the same 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.720
 strong so that it starts to fall 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.080
 avoid as far as possible the groups already 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.080
 do not take out of the fire 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.770
 I another habit that I want to share with 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.050
 you another healthy habit is to start 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.350
 avoid the dessert or not do not do it 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.600
 It is not rich the dessert is not but made to measure 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.880
 that you are taking it out of your diet 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.430
 everyday is to take the time in 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.220
 when nothing happens but the daily 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.770
 if they take it out from there what they will achieve 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.320
 is to have a little the flavors to the 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.110
 that accustoms the palate and what 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.170
 it happens is that our palate days 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.730
 sweet is already too sweet there's a lot 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.150
 people who eat a mango that in itself 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.540
 It's sweet and it does not taste true with my love 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.740
 small step 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:23.020
 two 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:27.370
 all striped talk the good you're 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.400
 accelerate your car accelerates we send you a 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.100
 greeting for a blonde 2 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.040
 give us that sees us from tomorrow and 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.780
 smoothness 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.430
 well I will add now yes the flour 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.770
 is 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.090
 little by little I'm going to help with a 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.090
 spoon before they say ya shot 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.770
 but this I'm going to do 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.400
 little by little 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.500
 and it does not work for I'm going to do this 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.060
 because they are practicing everything but 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.770
 I'll pay 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.060
 blender better not try this at home not 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.130
 it suits you then you're going to have to clean 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.110
 the walls and if you really do not 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.669
 All I'm going to do is agree that 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:20.249
 I'm going to do it in this way remembering 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.049
 that this is warm 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.110
 probably hot and still 

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:27.870
 then have to beat a little 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.990
 and then I will add the rest to not 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.880
 heat this the clear ones that we already have 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.030
 assembled 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:41.130
 the joke that they're still fluffy and everything 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.870
 the show goes through the other to the other both of 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.510
 the brave mix we already have our 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:50.490
 180 degree oven 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.490
 and then the last thing that remains 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.260
 the pan you want it you want this with 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.260
 ita 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.440
 ok it's fine it's fine 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.240
 and I'm going to mix mix mix mix 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.340
 Mix 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:11.460
 here since it is mixed charles bojan 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.849
 take 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.389
 this 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:19.819
 to finish adding the sparks 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:21.420
 in an enveloping mode I will add the 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:26.610
 sparks 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:30.210
 we will do by way of a kind 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.390
 of wrapping he hears that by the way that's 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:38.310
 wrapping presents is not my thing 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:40.590
 I'm going to pour it in a container 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.120
 that I already have here with waxed paper and 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.860
 is what I put in the oven I want 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.410
 remind you of our hashtag of the day 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.600
 New Year 's resolutions today no 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.850
 I'm going to concentrate on the faults of the 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.750
 others or what they have done or stopped 

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.490

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.580
 interiority let's see the next 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.580
 function
