video
wow<00:01:44.420> it's<00:01:44.960> way<00:01:45.140> quicker<00:01:47.590> there's<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.710> big

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
wow it's way quicker there's a big

difference<00:01:49.340> for<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.580> pricing<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.299> do

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:02.440 
difference for the pricing that you do
pay<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.710> almost<00:01:58.509> 15<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.810> 20<00:02:00.290> seconds<00:02:00.710> lower<00:02:01.450> you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
pay so almost 15 to 20 seconds lower you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.820 
pay so almost 15 to 20 seconds lower you
can<00:02:02.570> see<00:02:02.750> it's<00:02:02.869> still<00:02:03.080> slow<00:02:05.440> take<00:02:06.440> some<00:02:06.619> time

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
can see it's still slow take some time

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.830 
can see it's still slow take some time
definitely<00:02:07.369> for<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.610> one<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.030> load<00:02:08.300> up<00:02:10.840> even

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
definitely for this one to load up even

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.550 
definitely for this one to load up even
though<00:02:11.989> yeah<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:12.800> one<00:02:13.010> game<00:02:13.250> stall<00:02:13.610> and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
few apps are also installed but she

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.759 
few apps are also installed but she
definitely<00:02:18.080> not<00:02:18.709> be<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.370> slow<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.320> mean<00:02:21.320> still

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
definitely not be this slow I mean still

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:29.020 
definitely not be this slow I mean still
is<00:02:22.130> slow<00:02:22.670> here<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> menu<00:02:26.140> still<00:02:27.140> slow<00:02:28.030> I'm

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
is slow here in the menu still slow I'm

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.009 
is slow here in the menu still slow I'm
sure<00:02:29.269> what<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.750> is

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
sure what it is

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.650 
sure what it is
but<00:02:30.860> sometimes<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.880> device<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.330> becomes

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
but sometimes if this device it becomes

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.040 
but sometimes if this device it becomes
really<00:02:33.500> really<00:02:33.620> slow<00:02:34.360> now<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.569> starting<00:02:35.930> to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
really really slow now it's starting to

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.510 
really really slow now it's starting to
speed<00:02:36.290> up<00:02:37.090> still<00:02:38.090> slow

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.640 

but<00:02:44.300> that's<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.960> thing<00:02:45.080> with<00:02:45.260> one<00:02:45.440> year's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
but that's the thing with one year's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.460 
but that's the thing with one year's
Duke<00:02:45.980> or<00:02:46.310> with<00:02:46.490> Android<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.320> definitely

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
Duke or with Android it can definitely

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.760 
Duke or with Android it can definitely
slow<00:02:49.040> down<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.230> that's<00:02:51.230> something<00:02:51.620> that's

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
slow down and that's something that's

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.620 
slow down and that's something that's
good<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.160> with<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.550> MIT<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.210> doesn't<00:02:53.540> do

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
good here with the MIT it doesn't do

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.780 
good here with the MIT it doesn't do
that<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.950> could<00:02:55.160> be<00:02:55.250> good<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.520> know<00:02:55.780> yeah
