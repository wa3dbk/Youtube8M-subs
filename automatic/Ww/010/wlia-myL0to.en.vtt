00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
a redstone and the mechanics inside of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.580 
a redstone and the mechanics inside of
dispensers<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.019> way<00:00:25.050> dispensers<00:00:25.590> work<00:00:25.769> is

one rarely matic is usually fill

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.160 
one rarely matic is usually fill
dispensers<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.550> thing<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
dispensers with one thing but for the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
dispensers with one thing but for the
sake<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.100> fill<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
sake of this you can actually fill it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.299 
sake of this you can actually fill it
with<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:45.140> eight<00:00:46.140> spaces<00:00:46.590> filled<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.160> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
with the eight spaces filled up with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
with the eight spaces filled up with
arrows<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> space<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.899> filled<00:00:49.079> up

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
arrows and one of the space is filled up

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860 
arrows and one of the space is filled up
with<00:00:49.289> sand<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.969> that'll<00:00:50.969> make<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
with sand and that'll make it so you can

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
with sand and that'll make it so you can
have<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.350> sort<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> random<00:00:53.820> number<00:00:54.210> generated

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
have a sort of random number generated

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
have a sort of random number generated
between<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.110> two<00:00:55.610> one<00:00:56.610> being<00:00:56.850> send<00:00:57.180> into

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
between one and two one being send into

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.470 
between one and two one being send into
being<00:00:57.750> arrows<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.530> whenever<00:00:59.280> you<00:01:00.090> press<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
being arrows so whenever you press this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.429 
being arrows so whenever you press this
button<00:01:00.690> over<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:03.239> sends<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.930> pulse<00:01:04.110> out

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
button over here it sends a pulse out

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.390 
button over here it sends a pulse out
towards<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.680> sets<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> goes

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
towards here and sets it so it goes

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.330 
towards here and sets it so it goes
through<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.340> randomly

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
through here and up to here randomly

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
through here and up to here randomly
dispensing<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> two<00:01:12.390> items<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
dispensing out one of the two items and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
dispensing out one of the two items and
if<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.530> arrow<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.310> won't<00:01:14.580> activate

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
if it's just an arrow it won't activate

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.990 
if it's just an arrow it won't activate
this<00:01:15.090> pressure<00:01:15.330> plate<00:01:15.689> which<00:01:16.500> will<00:01:16.799> allow<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this pressure plate which will allow the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.719 
this pressure plate which will allow the
signal<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.689> through<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.520> signaling<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
signal to go through and signaling to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
signal to go through and signaling to
note<00:01:20.909> blocks<00:01:21.180> over<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.630> signaling<00:01:22.290> that's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
note blocks over there signaling that's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
note blocks over there signaling that's
like<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> lot<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.700> words<00:01:23.939> signaling<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
like a lot of words signaling in a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
like a lot of words signaling in a
sentence<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.619> i'm<00:01:25.920> showing<00:01:26.310> signifying<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
sentence but i'm showing signifying the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.830 
sentence but i'm showing signifying the
era<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.340> didn't<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> sand<00:01:30.270> block<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
era that you didn't get a sand block and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.170 
era that you didn't get a sand block and
if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.070> hits<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.549> pressure<00:01:32.850> plate

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
if you do it hits this pressure plate

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.569 
if you do it hits this pressure plate
pulls<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.140> piston<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> doesn't

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pulls this piston back so it doesn't

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.660 
pulls this piston back so it doesn't
signify<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.430> travels<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
signify over there and travels all the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
signify over there and travels all the
way<00:01:38.970> along<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.780> hitting<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> these

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
way along over here hitting all of these

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.499 
way along over here hitting all of these
dispensers<00:01:41.460> filled<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:41.820> diamonds<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
dispensers filled with diamonds and you

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.310 
dispensers filled with diamonds and you
win<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.320> let's<00:01:44.100> actually<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:46.259> if

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
win so let's actually do it and see if

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
win so let's actually do it and see if
we<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.040> sand<00:01:47.640> blocks<00:01:47.939> let<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.299> see

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
we can get some sand blocks let me see

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.560 
we can get some sand blocks let me see
if<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.899> sound<00:01:49.170> turned<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.799> can

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
if I have my sound turned up so I can

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.640
