00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.100
 crossbowmen 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.630
 salmon mushrooms cottage milk flour onions olive oil and salt 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 we start throwing the cava - opera and we will let it boil 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.939
 we prepare the salmon which will best be removed later 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.099
 but let's talk more easily 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.559
 and we clean the mushrooms is to remove the tail 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 and we cut them atrocious 2 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.260
 we will see how we accompany them to an onion 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.780
 that we are going to chop we were going to bet 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.140
 the cava is already boiling we introduce the salmon inside it and we let 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 is made 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.730
 there we have the chopped onion and then pull daily when we add 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.980
 the mushrooms would not serve anyone is cited which is any unit of sects 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.460
 that we have on hand would not work for the recipe 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.149
 we season, we think so, except we stir well 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.050
 and now we are going on a bit of haina to get fat 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.830
 the sauce we're going to make in the mossa do first we're fine 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.460
 adding 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.430
 a little of the cava 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.090
 reduced already 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.090
 we have with salmon 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.220
 and to the cava we will also add milk 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.000
 it's also how we're checking salmon cooking achievement 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.540
 is ready to go to go to liters of milk 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.590
 and we're going to leave it there so that the sauce is expressed 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.740
 we let it simmer while the salmon 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.770
 we took it out of the draw and now we take off the skin 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.540
 what is made much easier 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.040
 so it's easier 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.780
 take away company acquired scales that sometimes we the goods of the fishmonger 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.309
 we put it nice we place 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.159
 the pieces of salmon 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.159
 above the mushrooms and maybe we are 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.009
 despite our recipe salmon with champagne mushrooms we need salmon 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.449
 cottage sects also onion 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.449
 milk flour oil salt and pepper 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.509
 we cook the salmon inside the cava we sautÃ© the mushrooms in a pan with 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.579
 oil 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.439
 we add a little bit of reduced cottage flour and milk and let it cook until 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.869
 that thick 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.199
 we cover the salmon with the sauce 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.639
 and place the garnish mushrooms
