00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.020 

I've<00:04:47.330> got<00:04:47.480> this<00:04:47.680> see<00:04:48.680> car<00:04:48.950> can't<00:04:49.430> exactly<00:04:49.760> run

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030

by<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.240> name<00:04:50.420> right<00:04:50.630> now<00:04:50.780> but<00:04:51.010> it's<00:04:52.010> different

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
by the name right now but it's different

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.070 
by the name right now but it's different
from<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.610> Yamaha<00:04:52.970> standard<00:04:53.450> one<00:04:53.600> it's<00:04:53.810> just

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
from the Yamaha standard one it's just

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.730 
from the Yamaha standard one it's just
completely<00:04:54.680> smooth<00:04:55.100> hasn't<00:04:55.430> got<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.610> big<00:04:55.760> pad
