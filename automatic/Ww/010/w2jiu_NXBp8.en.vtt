put<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.990> anyway<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.560> reason

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
put up with this anyway the other reason

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.130 
put up with this anyway the other reason
why<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.400> wanted<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> talk<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.810> morning

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
why we wanted to talk about this morning

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
why we wanted to talk about this morning
point<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:38.189> you're<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> handy<00:01:39.060> thing

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
point is because you're the handy thing

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
point is because you're the handy thing
is<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:39.900> drive<00:01:40.259> off<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.829> down

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
is if we actually drive off and down

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
is if we actually drive off and down
this<00:01:41.130> road<00:01:41.600> spin<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> around<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.079> come<00:01:43.290> back

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this road spin it around and come back

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.580 
this road spin it around and come back
again<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.479> another<00:01:46.350> one

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
again there will be another one

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.399 
again there will be another one
instantly<00:01:47.040> spawned<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.610> its<00:01:47.759> place<00:01:48.409> now

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
instantly spawned in its place now

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
instantly spawned in its place now
that's<00:01:49.649> good<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.130> two<00:01:50.430> reasons<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that's good for two reasons one if you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.700 
that's good for two reasons one if you
don't<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> color<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
don't like the color then you can just

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.590 
don't like the color then you can just
swap<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.890> over<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.790> two<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> point

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
swap it over but two more to the point

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
swap it over but two more to the point
if<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.020> come<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.890> couple<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> your
