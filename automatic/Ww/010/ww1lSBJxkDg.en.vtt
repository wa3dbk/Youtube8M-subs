00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.460
 well this about two to a new video 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.930
 well it seems we have three works 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.520
 that unity was written and its development 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.070
 it seems that it is being developed 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.480
 for ten different studies neither more nor 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.550
 less the truth that is enough 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.500
 awesome good to remember that it will be the 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.480
 first accÃ©sit of new generation 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.759
 completely rumored to be released 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.989
 another for previous generation different 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.810
 but you still do not know absolutely 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.339
 nothing of that there are rumors and others but not 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.409
 we're not going to talk about it now we're going to 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.579
 talk about juniti that you already know what 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:33.079
 good that they will be the French revolution 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.280
 in the full 18th century in Paris and good since 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.410
 know it will be launched at the end of this 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.239
 good year basically the 10 studies 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.010
 charged with developing the game on 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.170
 top ubisoft montreal as ya 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.239
 you know and it has always been the same 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.890
 ubisoft toronto joins ubisoft singapore 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.890
 ubisoft and xxi 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 ubisoft quebec ubisoft bucharest ubisoft 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.760
 shanghai 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.769
 ubisoft chengdu ubisoft kiev and ubisoft 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.999
 montpellier with which those are the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.070
 ten studies commissioned in the 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.149
 description development it and I think 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.380
 that you can get a pretty game 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.630
 good with so many people working and good 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.400
 let's hope we go something in the e3 about 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.400
 about the title I guess it's called mos 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.990
 it is the main thing to remember that ubisoft is 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.340
 has made the company one of the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.740
 Companies with more workers 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.140
 right now at the moment of fact if 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.420
 you go to france and have family there 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.890
 is surely working in ubisoft 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.030
 remember he has nine thousand two hundred 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 employees and that in 7,800 are dedicated 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.740
 exclusively for production tasks 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 in 1200 then also in the facet of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.429
 business and others with which then 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.799
 they imagined the piece of template that 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.890
 they have these people are very impressive 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.509
 I say it very seriously, nothing else 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.520
 We will see how kids get this 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.439
 game but really watching the amount 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.569
 of developers that come together because they are 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.979
 enough to remember that in many several 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.360
 of them are also developing far 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.520
 cry 4 or 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.049
 I suppose some will be advising or 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.770
 doing different things and we'll see 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.719
 watch 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 4 and which believes this is to enroll as you 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.289
 it goes to ubisoft but I think they can 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.849
 have a / is pretty good always 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.869
 well last year I had it pretty 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.399
 good but this one can also be 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.369
 pretty good if they present a new 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.619
 rayman or a new prince of persia 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.390
 also because it can be them and round like this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.780
 what good nothing more kids June 9 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.750
 of 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.280
 this same year of 3 2014 we will see and see 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.550
 nothing we go in the next video until the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.550
 next
