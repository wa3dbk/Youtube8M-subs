00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.360
 Today's question, 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.620
 Friends who like to ask fortune tellers, 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.380
 I heard that my friend went to the fortune teller at the cafe. 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.360
 I became uncomfortable. 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.540
 Please tell me more about fortune tellers at the cafe. 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.000
 I got a question like that, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 What I want to ask from the beginning is, 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.120
 What is being done to the fortune teller at the cafe? 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.000
 "Personal prophet" 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.620
 This is what was mentioned. 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.200
 Personal fortune teller is, 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.660
 The person who has the gift of prophecy, 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.760
 Against someone, 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.390
 This is the word of God. This is what God says, 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.820
 To tell us, 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.909
 This is personal prophecy. 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.510
 So this time, 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.559
 Rather than what the prophecy of the prophecy of the prophet said, 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.920
 More importantly, 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.600
 "Gift of prophecy" 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.580
 The thing that we have to think about, 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.220
 What you want to talk about, 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.020
 I will convey three things, as usual. 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 First, what is the gift of prophecy? 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 In the Bible when saying prophecy, 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.060
 This is not a "prediction" from previous notice, 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.280
 But it is "words that are deposited" 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 Written so and read "Prophecy" 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.409
 Namely those who are said to be prophets, in the Bible. 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.570
 Or someone who is given prophethood 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.760
 Custody of the word of God, 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.660
 This is a mission to make it to deliver the word to people. 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.540
 Of course in that work, 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.679
 Of course it can also predict what will happen in the future. 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.560
 Some of it includes, 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 When we say prophesy, 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.030
 We write it as a word of care, 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.369
 And the prophets, 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.320
 The highlight of what has been written, 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.060
 This is the translation that becomes the Bible now, 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.400
 That is the gift of prophecy. 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.280
 Second question, 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 Is there still a gift of prophecy today? 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.060
 The Bible is finished. 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.790
 The gift of prophecy is no longer needed, 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.560
 So in our present lifetime, 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.800
 Reading the Bible, 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.910
 Ask for God's guidance, 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520
 Through the bible, 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.250
 To listen to the word of God, 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.110
 This is the most standard and correct way. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.830
 And for those who believe in the Bible, 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.200
 The help of the Holy Spirit is given. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.670
 Because for our promises, 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.530
 We depend on the gift of prophecy, 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.720
 The need to decide and guide action, 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.750
 It's no longer needed now. 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.280
 Third, 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.500
 Is personal prophecy biblical? 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.200
 Of course God still uses someone, 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.420
 There are times when we tell others about meditation, 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.820
 Because God is God 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.960
 It is not limited by anything, 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.900
 But as I mentioned before, 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.940
 The basics lie in finding God's guidance from the Bible, 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.200
 The person who proposes personal propaganda is doing the same thing with the seer, 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.420
 It is just, 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.480
 Will you go to another fortune teller and listen to the word fortune teller? 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.680
 Or go to someone who says that you are a Christian, 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.920
 Do you hear the fortune teller's words? 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.370
 There are only differences, 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.980
 The point is that translation is like fortune tellers, 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.920
 Personal forecast, 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.820
 There is a possibility to tie the person who listens to it, 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.220
 God said to you, 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.260
 At the cafe the prophecy is loose, 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.550
 You might feel this is an encouraging word. 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.180
 Or your analogy, 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.480
 But because it's getting taller, 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.060
 I will give more concrete instructions, 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.780
 This binds the listener, 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.120
 At the same time the person talking must be careful, 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.520
 It is said that "God says like this", 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.840
 This is a blasphemous act of God's name, 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.240
 Because actually, God does not necessarily say that, 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.900
 When saying "This is what the LORD says, 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.240
 Every time the name of the Lord is said by that person, 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.200
 It will blaspheme, 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.840
 In conclusion, personal prophecy, 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.820
 It is not a biblical act, 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.940
 See you again at the next Q &amp; A. 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.069
 thanks.
