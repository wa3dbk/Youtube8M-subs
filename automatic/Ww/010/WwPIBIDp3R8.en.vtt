00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hello, I will talk about the course 31 29 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.860
 our topic today is applications 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.309
 educational for impact 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 our goals are to create a video in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.749
 the purpose of seeking alternatives 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.810
 teaching that they are more entertaining and 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:23.849
 dynamic know about the applications 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.649
 educational activities that help us in the 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.649
 class and out of this 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.100
 is the application abbreviation now 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.530
 what is an app is a program that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 installs on a cell phone or tablet and it 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.420
 can integrate the characteristics of the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.730
 equipment can also be updated to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.320
 add the new features with the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.550
 passage of time 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.010
 which is the current the current one is the center 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.129
 of sales that the apple company has 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.739
 to grant us the availability of 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.450
 these applications with so many 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.820
 educational apps in the appstore 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.570
 the possibility of learning to your 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.120
 reach are unlimited 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.250
 I will be showing you applications about 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.260
 several educational categories starting 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.760
 with the mathematics that so much pain of 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.480
 head causes us 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.630
 basic more and more in targeted application 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.980
 children is super entertaining and helps them 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.750
 they talk about mathematics in the way 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.870
 more fun to get the best 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.290
 results and keep them motivated this 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.900

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.460
 application for algebra helps you 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.140
 solve the problems of assignments to 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.090
 review for exams and learn 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.610
 concepts of algebra so you can 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.550
 prepare before the courses 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 and go more competent not only helps you 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.630
 solve the problems but it shows you 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.310

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.550
 and add real images 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.190
 the application comes prepared with 11 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.290
