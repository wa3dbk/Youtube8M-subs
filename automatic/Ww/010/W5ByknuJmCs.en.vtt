architecture what we've realized is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.750 
architecture what we've realized is
technology<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.619> serves<00:00:20.039> our<00:00:20.310> clients<00:00:20.699> a

lot<00:00:20.789> better<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:22.140> gives<00:00:22.890> our<00:00:23.340> clients

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
lot better because it gives our clients

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.620 
lot better because it gives our clients

of architecture significantly we still

of architecture significantly we still

or<00:00:57.750> maybe<00:00:58.379> even<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:58.739> larger<00:00:59.309> than<00:00:59.340> we

feed<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.390> through<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.870> scanner<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.590> then

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
feed that through the scanner and then

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
feed that through the scanner and then
he'll<00:01:02.699> scan<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.439> PDF<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.750> store<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
he'll scan it in to PDF and store that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.520 
he'll scan it in to PDF and store that
and<00:01:07.350> send<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.549> various<00:01:09.000> manners<00:01:09.530> we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and send that in various manners we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.090 
and send that in various manners we
found<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> design<00:01:11.580> yet<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.330> 2300<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.890> easy

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
found the design yet to 2300 very easy

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.410 
found the design yet to 2300 very easy
to<00:01:14.400> use<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.900> time<00:01:16.200> savings<00:01:16.909> by<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to use the time savings by using the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.560 
to use the time savings by using the
scanner<00:01:18.750> has<00:01:19.049> been<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.770> an<00:01:19.890> awesome<00:01:20.009> teacher

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
scanner has been just an awesome teacher

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.969 
scanner has been just an awesome teacher
I'd<00:01:21.570> say<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.049> areas<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.619> probably

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I'd say in some areas it's probably

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.380 
I'd say in some areas it's probably
saved<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> fifty<00:01:23.970> percent<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.689> our<00:01:25.110> time

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
saved up to fifty percent of our time

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
saved up to fifty percent of our time
the<00:01:27.390> menus<00:01:27.780> were<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.320> easy<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.710> understand

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the menus were very easy to understand

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.609 
the menus were very easy to understand
it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.490> very<00:01:29.909> simple<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.630> hit<00:01:30.810> scan<00:01:31.170> or<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it was very simple you hit scan or you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.880 
it was very simple you hit scan or you
hit<00:01:31.799> print<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> pretty<00:01:32.880> much

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
hit print and it pretty much

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
hit print and it pretty much
we've<00:01:34.890> been<00:01:35.100> using<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.640> daily<00:01:35.940> for<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.380> our

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
we've been using it daily for all of our

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100 
we've been using it daily for all of our
plotting<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.630> our<00:01:39.840> color

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
plotting as well as for our color

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.590

graphics<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> presentation<00:01:41.640> boards<00:01:42.030> it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
graphics and presentation boards it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.870 
graphics and presentation boards it's
amazing<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:43.080> much<00:01:43.290> faster<00:01:43.800> they<00:01:43.979> develop<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
amazing how much faster they develop the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
amazing how much faster they develop the
plotters<00:01:45.330> we're<00:01:46.320> learning<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.800> use

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
plotters we're learning how to use

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
plotters we're learning how to use
technology<00:01:47.720> as<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.869> tool<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.560> we're<00:01:49.710> not

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
technology as a tool so we're not

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830 
technology as a tool so we're not
thinking<00:01:50.369> about<00:01:50.729> how<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> make<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> work<00:01:51.570> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
thinking about how to make it work for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.340 
thinking about how to make it work for
us<00:01:51.869> we're<00:01:52.590> being<00:01:53.009> able<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> focus<00:01:53.580> now<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.350> what

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
us we're being able to focus now on what

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499 
us we're being able to focus now on what
we're<00:01:55.530> creating<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.369> let<00:01:56.520> technology<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
we're creating and let technology just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.670 
we're creating and let technology just
be<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.750> tool<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.320> helps<00:01:58.770> us<00:01:59.009> achieve<00:01:59.040> that
