done<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> aquaponics<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.399> he<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> tell

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
done a lot of aquaponics and he can tell

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
done a lot of aquaponics and he can tell
you<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.720> really<00:01:45.869> interesting<00:01:46.110> stuff<00:01:46.320> about

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you some really interesting stuff about

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
you some really interesting stuff about
the<00:01:47.369> history<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> aquaponics<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.329> how<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the history of aquaponics and how it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
the history of aquaponics and how it
works<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:49.590> interestingly<00:01:49.920> he's<00:01:50.670> got<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> lot

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
works now interestingly he's got a lot

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.899 
works now interestingly he's got a lot
of<00:01:51.060> experience<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.780> geodesic<00:01:52.590> domes<00:01:52.860> now<00:01:53.850> we

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
of experience with geodesic domes now we

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
of experience with geodesic domes now we
have<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.240> advertised<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.869> yet<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.140> we're

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
have an advertised this yet but we're

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.039 
have an advertised this yet but we're
going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.860> having<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.159> whole<00:01:56.310> segment<00:01:56.610> on

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
going to be having a whole segment on

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.130 
going to be having a whole segment on
geodesic<00:01:58.049> domes<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.770> our<00:01:59.009> training<00:01:59.549> seminar

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
geodesic domes at our training seminar

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.060 
geodesic domes at our training seminar
we're<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> guy<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
we're actually going to have a guy that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.469 
we're actually going to have a guy that
a<00:02:02.130> build<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.460> small<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.000> show<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
a build a small one to show you how to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
a build a small one to show you how to
do<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.100> fantastic<00:02:05.729> I

wonderful thing to in cold weather

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.660 
wonderful thing to in cold weather
climates<00:02:09.239> into

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
climates into

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.309 
climates into
you<00:02:09.759> know<00:02:09.849> because<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.720> strength<00:02:11.110> they

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319

the farm building this farm up getting
it<00:02:26.350> running<00:02:26.500> you'll<00:02:27.459> see<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.850> as<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.270> look

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it running you'll see that as you look

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.170 
it running you'll see that as you look
dig<00:02:28.600> down<00:02:28.780> through<00:02:28.840> my<00:02:29.140> video<00:02:29.410> clips<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.430> what

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
dig down through my video clips so what

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.630 
dig down through my video clips so what
a<00:02:31.209> great<00:02:31.480> team<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.739> got<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.010> emphasize<00:02:33.430> for

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
a great team I just got to emphasize for

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.820 
a great team I just got to emphasize for
you<00:02:33.730> we're<00:02:34.360> not<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> place<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.650> doing

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
you we're not just the place is doing

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.800 
you we're not just the place is doing
training<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:36.519> just<00:02:36.760> got<00:02:36.940> one<00:02:37.180> farm<00:02:37.540> we've

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
training that's just got one farm we've

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.009 
training that's just got one farm we've
had<00:02:37.989> one<00:02:38.200> farm<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.739> now<00:02:38.920> we're<00:02:39.099> an<00:02:39.190> expert<00:02:39.519> now

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
had one farm so now we're an expert now

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.140 
had one farm so now we're an expert now
we've<00:02:41.019> got<00:02:41.230> multiple<00:02:41.590> facets<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.519> experience

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
