00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
time the problem with these of course is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.069 
time the problem with these of course is
that<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.909> current<00:01:21.270> condition<00:01:21.899> they

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
got some shower rated pins in there so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.529 
got some shower rated pins in there so
it<00:01:40.890> takes<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.729> serious<00:01:42.000> skill<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539

I'm<00:01:50.369> sure<00:01:50.729> hundreds<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> times<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> thing

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
I'm sure hundreds of times the thing

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.319 
I'm sure hundreds of times the thing
that<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.520> worries<00:01:53.759> me<00:01:53.880> about<00:01:54.149> these

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that really worries me about these

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
that really worries me about these
particular<00:01:54.750> locks<00:01:55.109> is<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.680> are

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
particular locks is that there are

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.060 
particular locks is that there are
bypasses<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:58.409> bypasses

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
bypasses out there for them now bypasses

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.709 
bypasses out there for them now bypasses
I've<00:01:59.219> covered<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.700> another<00:01:59.850> video<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
I've covered that in another video but

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.010 
I've covered that in another video but
just<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.259> suffice<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> say<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.609> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> one

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
just as suffice to say the this is a one

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
just as suffice to say the this is a one
made<00:02:04.200> by<00:02:04.229> Peterson<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.369> out<00:02:05.609> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
made by Peterson but this one is out of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.639 
made by Peterson but this one is out of
I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> patent<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.590> are

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
I think it's out a patent there are

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.859 
I think it's out a patent there are
other<00:02:07.910> manufacturers<00:02:08.910> making<00:02:09.149> these<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:09.630> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
other manufacturers making these now and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.020 
other manufacturers making these now and
a<00:02:10.350> bypass<00:02:10.740> simply<00:02:11.160> goes<00:02:11.370> through<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> key<00:02:11.850> way

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
a bypass simply goes through the key way

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.660 
a bypass simply goes through the key way
and<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:13.140> will<00:02:13.230> bypass<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.680> locking<00:02:14.130> mechanism

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
and it will bypass the locking mechanism

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.120 
and it will bypass the locking mechanism
I<00:02:14.820> can<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.960> cooperate<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:17.040> it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
I can get it to cooperate and then it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.750 
I can get it to cooperate and then it
will<00:02:17.250> rotate<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.700> cam<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
will rotate the cam as you see here so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.280 
will rotate the cam as you see here so
newer<00:02:20.760> locks<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.990> one<00:02:22.200> was

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
newer locks like this one this one was

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.670 
newer locks like this one this one was
made<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.530> 2012<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> anniversary

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
made in 2012 this is the anniversary

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.209 
made in 2012 this is the anniversary
addition<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.219> might<00:02:25.939> require<00:02:26.269> an<00:02:26.480> extra<00:02:26.780> step

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
addition it might require an extra step

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.009 
addition it might require an extra step
we<00:02:28.219> can<00:02:28.370> still<00:02:28.579> use<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.939> bypass<00:02:29.299> tool<00:02:29.569> but

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
we can still use the bypass tool but

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.349 
we can still use the bypass tool but
before<00:02:30.379> we<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:31.519> have<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.849> use<00:02:32.060> this

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
before we do that we have to use this

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.599 
before we do that we have to use this
wafer<00:02:32.810> breaker<00:02:33.109> tool<00:02:33.439> because<00:02:34.099> inside<00:02:34.579> of

wafer breaker tool because inside of
there<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.409> of<00:02:36.500> these<00:02:36.650> small<00:02:36.980> wafers<00:02:37.700> and

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
there is one of these small wafers and

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.569 
there is one of these small wafers and
we<00:02:38.750> have<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.049> use<00:02:39.260> these<00:02:39.500> bypass<00:02:40.010> tools<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
we have to use these bypass tools of

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.759 
we have to use these bypass tools of
these<00:02:40.670> wafer<00:02:41.030> breakers<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.780> knock<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> hole<00:02:42.590> in

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
these wafer breakers to knock a hole in

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.759 
these wafer breakers to knock a hole in
it<00:02:42.889> so<00:02:43.879> that<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.150> looks<00:02:44.359> more<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.560> one

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
it so that it looks more like this one

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.339 
it so that it looks more like this one
and<00:02:46.060> once<00:02:47.060> we've<00:02:47.269> knocked<00:02:47.719> a<00:02:47.870> hole<00:02:48.019> in<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.319> with

and once we've knocked a hole in it with
these<00:02:48.650> tools<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:50.170> we<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:51.349> take<00:02:51.530> our<00:02:52.540> get

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
these tools then we can take our get

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.479 
these tools then we can take our get
everything<00:02:53.719> together<00:02:53.900> here<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:55.010> can<00:02:55.189> take<00:02:55.310> our

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
everything together here we can take our

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.559 
everything together here we can take our
defeat<00:02:55.819> tool<00:02:56.030> or<00:02:56.329> our<00:02:56.450> bypass<00:02:56.870> tool<00:02:58.450> with<00:02:59.450> the

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
hole and knocked in the back and now we

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.740 
hole and knocked in the back and now we
can<00:03:01.159> do<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.819> can<00:03:01.849> slide<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.329> through

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
can do it we can slide it through

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.979 
can do it we can slide it through
now<00:03:03.439> does<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.799> delay<00:03:04.370> me<00:03:04.579> yes<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.389> does<00:03:05.659> if<00:03:05.870> I

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
now does that delay me yes it does if I

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.349 
now does that delay me yes it does if I
choose<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.379> break<00:03:06.590> into<00:03:06.829> your<00:03:06.889> facility<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.579> can

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
choose to break into your facility I can

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.000 
choose to break into your facility I can
still<00:03:08.599> defeat<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.079> but<00:03:09.349> now<00:03:09.560> instead<00:03:09.950> of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
still defeat this but now instead of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.520 
still defeat this but now instead of
simply<00:03:10.400> using<00:03:10.669> a<00:03:10.730> bypass<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.349> this

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
simply using a bypass now I have this

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.300 
simply using a bypass now I have this
extra<00:03:13.099> step<00:03:13.400> I've<00:03:13.819> got<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.299> use<00:03:14.419> these<00:03:14.569> brake

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
extra step I've got to use these brake

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.009 
extra step I've got to use these brake
disk<00:03:16.310> breakers<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.909> break<00:03:17.120> through<00:03:17.299> but<00:03:17.900> I'm

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
disk breakers to break through but I'm

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.659 
disk breakers to break through but I'm
still<00:03:18.349> going<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.859> get<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.189> I<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:22.370> get<00:03:22.489> my

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
still going to get in I can get my

still going to get in I can get my
coordination<00:03:23.599> together<00:03:24.049> this<00:03:24.230> morning<00:03:24.469> I'm

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
coordination together this morning I'm

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.709 
coordination together this morning I'm
still<00:03:25.639> going<00:03:25.819> to<00:03:25.849> defeat<00:03:26.120> your<00:03:26.269> lock<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:26.719 
still going to defeat your lock and

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.860 
still going to defeat your lock and
fairly<00:03:27.019> quick<00:03:27.530> fairly<00:03:28.430> quickly<00:03:28.639> about<00:03:29.030> within

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
fairly quick fairly quickly about within

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.619 
fairly quick fairly quickly about within
three<00:03:30.139> or<00:03:30.260> four<00:03:30.409> minutes<00:03:31.329> what<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.359> like<00:03:32.540> to

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
three or four minutes what I like to

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.599 
three or four minutes what I like to
talk<00:03:32.780> about<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.169> ways<00:03:33.530> we<00:03:33.799> can<00:03:33.949> harden<00:03:34.400> these

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
talk about is ways we can harden these

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.449 
talk about is ways we can harden these
up<00:03:34.879> we<00:03:35.359> still<00:03:35.629> can't<00:03:36.019> afford<00:03:36.220> $1,000<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.400> a

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
up we still can't afford $1,000 for a

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.189 
up we still can't afford $1,000 for a
lock<00:03:37.699> so<00:03:38.000> this<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.389> what<00:03:38.569> we're<00:03:38.720> stuck<00:03:38.989> with

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
lock so this is what we're stuck with

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.530 
lock so this is what we're stuck with
now<00:03:40.159> I<00:03:40.340> don't<00:03:40.579> want<00:03:40.699> to<00:03:40.790> think<00:03:40.970> think<00:03:41.299> that's<00:03:41.449> a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
now I don't want to think think that's a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.210 
now I don't want to think think that's a
bad<00:03:41.720> thing<00:03:41.750> these<00:03:42.139> are<00:03:42.199> very<00:03:42.500> high<00:03:42.709> quality

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
bad thing these are very high quality

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.969 
bad thing these are very high quality
steel<00:03:43.459> locks<00:03:43.819> very<00:03:44.229> durable<00:03:45.229> hats<00:03:45.680> all

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
hardness steel it's the internal

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.409 
hardness steel it's the internal
mechanism<00:03:48.829> that's<00:03:49.040> giving<00:03:49.340> us<00:03:49.430> problems<00:03:49.729> so

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
mechanism that's giving us problems so

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:51.759 
mechanism that's giving us problems so
there's<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.629> couple<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.989> things<00:03:51.169> we<00:03:51.349> can<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.650> to

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
there's a couple of things we can do to

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.039 
there's a couple of things we can do to
toughen<00:03:52.189> it<00:03:52.250> up<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.970> give<00:03:53.239> us<00:03:53.389> more<00:03:53.659> time<00:03:53.720> to

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
toughen it up to give us more time to

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.399 
toughen it up to give us more time to
defeat<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.769> criminal<00:03:55.689> the<00:03:56.689> first<00:03:56.930> area<00:03:57.259> that

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
defeat that criminal the first area that

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.679 
defeat that criminal the first area that
we<00:03:57.560> like<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:58.220> look<00:03:58.340> at<00:03:58.519> when<00:03:58.819> I<00:03:58.849> get<00:03:59.479> these

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
we like to look at when I get these

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.599 
we like to look at when I get these
locks<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.319> don't<00:04:00.859> throw<00:04:01.040> them<00:04:01.159> away

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
locks I don't throw them away

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.490 
locks I don't throw them away
the<00:04:02.030> first<00:04:02.269> thing<00:04:02.449> I<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.599> get<00:04:03.169> to<00:04:03.259> get<00:04:03.379> some

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
the first thing I do get to get some

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.699 
the first thing I do get to get some
focus<00:04:03.709> going<00:04:04.069> here<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.840> first<00:04:06.079> thing<00:04:06.259> I<00:04:06.379> do<00:04:06.439> is

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
focus going here the first thing I do is

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.229 
focus going here the first thing I do is
of<00:04:06.859> course<00:04:07.069> I<00:04:07.189> have<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.489> rekey<00:04:07.879> them<00:04:08.120> if

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
of course I have to rekey them if

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.089 
of course I have to rekey them if
somebody's<00:04:08.599> for<00:04:08.870> example<00:04:09.259> super<00:04:09.620> glued<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:09.979> I

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
somebody's for example super glued it I

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.920 
somebody's for example super glued it I
have<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> put<00:04:10.519> in<00:04:10.609> new<00:04:10.699> core<00:04:10.939> in<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.209> I'll<00:04:11.659> put<00:04:11.900> a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
have to put in new core in it I'll put a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.110 
have to put in new core in it I'll put a
new<00:04:12.109> key<00:04:12.379> you'll<00:04:13.250> notice<00:04:13.579> that<00:04:13.699> these<00:04:13.879> come

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
new key you'll notice that these come

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.779 
new key you'll notice that these come
from<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.389> factory<00:04:14.900> with<00:04:15.079> five<00:04:15.979> of<00:04:16.400> these

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
from the factory with five of these

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.240 
from the factory with five of these
holes<00:04:17.090> populated<00:04:17.989> five<00:04:18.470> very<00:04:18.979> high<00:04:19.190> quality

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
holes populated five very high quality

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.899 
holes populated five very high quality
security<00:04:19.820> pins<00:04:21.070> for<00:04:22.070> some<00:04:22.250> reason<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:22.789> I

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
security pins for some reason and I

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.189 
security pins for some reason and I
don't<00:04:22.970> know<00:04:23.150> if<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.419> cost-saving<00:04:24.169> measure

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
don't know if it's a cost-saving measure

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.920 
don't know if it's a cost-saving measure
or<00:04:24.740> what<00:04:24.919> they<00:04:25.580> always<00:04:25.789> leave<00:04:26.180> this<00:04:26.389> last<00:04:26.630> one

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
or what they always leave this last one

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.430 
or what they always leave this last one
empty<00:04:27.289> and<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:28.099> makes<00:04:28.310> absolutely<00:04:28.520> no<00:04:29.180> sense

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
empty and that makes absolutely no sense

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.110 
empty and that makes absolutely no sense
why<00:04:30.440> would<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.830> dumb<00:04:31.159> down<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.520> very<00:04:31.970> high

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
why would you dumb down a very high

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.180 
why would you dumb down a very high
quality<00:04:32.180> lock<00:04:32.779> by<00:04:33.050> leaving<00:04:33.440> one<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.710> your<00:04:33.860> by

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
quality lock by leaving one of your by

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.300 
quality lock by leaving one of your by
leaving<00:04:34.430> 20%<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.210> cylinders<00:04:36.139> empty<00:04:36.500> so

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
leaving 20% of the cylinders empty so

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.670 
leaving 20% of the cylinders empty so
the<00:04:37.430> first<00:04:37.610> thing<00:04:37.789> I<00:04:37.909> do<00:04:37.969> is<00:04:38.210> I'll<00:04:38.330> pop

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the first thing I do is I'll pop

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.670 
the first thing I do is I'll pop
that<00:04:39.190> sixth<00:04:39.820> one<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.479> if<00:04:40.630> you<00:04:40.870> choose<00:04:41.139> to<00:04:41.380> pick

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
that sixth one so if you choose to pick

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.310 
that sixth one so if you choose to pick
one<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.610> locks<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.090> I've<00:04:43.180> worked<00:04:43.389> on<00:04:43.600> now

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
one of the locks that I've worked on now

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.040 
one of the locks that I've worked on now
you<00:04:44.380> have<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.860> defeat<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.460> extra<00:04:46.270> pin<00:04:46.810> and

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
you have to defeat that extra pin and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.020 
you have to defeat that extra pin and
you<00:04:47.560> we<00:04:47.770> all<00:04:47.919> know<00:04:47.949> it<00:04:48.220> takes<00:04:48.250> longer<00:04:48.729> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
you we all know it takes longer to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.450 
you we all know it takes longer to
defeat<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.419> six<00:04:49.810> pin<00:04:50.050> high<00:04:50.350> security<00:04:50.800> lock<00:04:50.949> than

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
defeat a six pin high security lock than

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.850 
defeat a six pin high security lock than
a<00:04:51.490> five<00:04:51.789> pin<00:04:52.090> er<00:04:52.229> well<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.530> still<00:04:53.830> doesn't

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
a five pin er well that still doesn't

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.580 
a five pin er well that still doesn't
protect<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:54.910> from<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.750> from<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.440> bypass

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
protect you from the from the bypass

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.860 
protect you from the from the bypass
tools<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.940> here's<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.270> other<00:04:58.300> thing<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.690> I

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
tools so here's the other thing that I

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.560 
tools so here's the other thing that I
like<00:04:59.259> to<00:04:59.320> look<00:04:59.590> at<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.150> disks

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
like to look at and that is the disks

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.560 
like to look at and that is the disks
that<00:05:01.870> go<00:05:01.990> onto<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.320> back<00:05:03.060> when<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.150> comes<00:05:04.360> from

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
that go onto the back when it comes from

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.330 
that go onto the back when it comes from
the<00:05:04.690> factory<00:05:05.110> they<00:05:05.500> take<00:05:05.800> one<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.220> these

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
the factory they take one of these

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.129 
the factory they take one of these
stainless<00:05:06.940> steel<00:05:07.120> discs<00:05:07.600> which<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:07.930> ten

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
stainless steel discs which is ten

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.110 
stainless steel discs which is ten
thousandths<00:05:08.740> of<00:05:08.800> an<00:05:08.949> inch<00:05:09.009> thick<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.520> they

thousandths of an inch thick and they

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.450 
thousandths of an inch thick and they
put<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.479> on<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:10.690> back<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:11.199> of<00:05:11.289> course<00:05:11.530> we've

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
put it on the back and of course we've

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.249 
put it on the back and of course we've
already<00:05:12.669> seen<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.210> those<00:05:13.479> can<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.780> punched

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
already seen that those can be punched

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.230 
already seen that those can be punched
through<00:05:14.530> they're<00:05:15.099> tough<00:05:15.430> it's<00:05:15.880> stainless

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
through they're tough it's stainless

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.610 
through they're tough it's stainless
steel<00:05:16.630> but<00:05:17.560> it's<00:05:18.039> not<00:05:18.449> immune<00:05:19.449> to<00:05:19.720> penetration

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
steel but it's not immune to penetration

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.800 
steel but it's not immune to penetration
you'll<00:05:21.430> also<00:05:21.610> notice<00:05:21.940> there's<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.270> lot<00:05:22.449> of<00:05:22.630> room

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.900 
you'll also notice there's a lot of room
on<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.199> back<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.530> this<00:05:23.620> lock<00:05:23.889> there's<00:05:24.729> no

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
on the back of this lock there's no

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.850 
on the back of this lock there's no
reason<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.300> just<00:05:25.660> can't<00:05:25.930> be<00:05:25.990> thicker<00:05:26.410> to

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
reason that just can't be thicker to

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.620 
reason that just can't be thicker to
make<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.160> even<00:05:27.250> tougher<00:05:27.729> or<00:05:27.910> even

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
make it even tougher or even

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.439 
make it even tougher or even
impenetrable<00:05:29.250> well<00:05:30.250> American<00:05:30.940> lock<00:05:31.090> doesn't

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
impenetrable well American lock doesn't

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.990 
impenetrable well American lock doesn't
want<00:05:31.570> to<00:05:31.660> give<00:05:31.840> us<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.199> inning<00:05:32.889> doesn't<00:05:33.880> want

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
want to give us the inning doesn't want

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.219 
want to give us the inning doesn't want
to<00:05:34.090> manufacture<00:05:34.599> it<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.870> new<00:05:35.490> wafer<00:05:36.599> but<00:05:37.599> when

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
to manufacture it a new wafer but when

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.740 
to manufacture it a new wafer but when
you<00:05:38.349> buy<00:05:38.530> them<00:05:38.770> they're<00:05:39.310> very<00:05:39.550> cheap<00:05:39.820> I<00:05:40.120> think

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
you buy them they're very cheap I think

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.300 
you buy them they're very cheap I think
it's<00:05:40.870> like<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.020> dollar<00:05:41.349> for<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:41.740> bag<00:05:41.979> and<00:05:42.190> there's

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
it's like a dollar for a bag and there's

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.850 
it's like a dollar for a bag and there's
ten<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.610> them<00:05:42.729> inside<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.150> there<00:05:43.440> so<00:05:44.440> why<00:05:44.680> don't

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
ten of them inside of there so why don't

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.710 
ten of them inside of there so why don't
we<00:05:44.949> make<00:05:45.070> our<00:05:45.250> own<00:05:45.310> waivers<00:05:45.849> and<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.330> way<00:05:46.479> I<00:05:46.510> do

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
we make our own waivers and the way I do

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.379 
we make our own waivers and the way I do
it<00:05:46.870> when<00:05:47.199> I<00:05:47.260> harden<00:05:47.590> up<00:05:47.710> these<00:05:47.889> locks<00:05:48.190> is<00:05:48.460> I'll

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
it when I harden up these locks is I'll

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.960 
it when I harden up these locks is I'll
take<00:05:49.599> multiples<00:05:50.199> and<00:05:50.470> put<00:05:51.400> them<00:05:51.580> on<00:05:51.760> there<00:05:51.940> and

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
take multiples and put them on there and

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.710 
take multiples and put them on there and
I<00:05:52.120> usually<00:05:52.360> will<00:05:52.690> put<00:05:52.960> three<00:05:53.949> and<00:05:54.720> sometimes

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
I usually will put three and sometimes

I usually will put three and sometimes
even<00:05:55.930> four<00:05:56.530> on<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.010> back<00:05:58.440> so<00:05:59.440> now<00:05:59.620> instead<00:06:00.010> of

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
even four on the back so now instead of

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.580 
even four on the back so now instead of
ten<00:06:00.610> thousandths<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.300> an<00:06:01.449> inch<00:06:01.539> thick<00:06:01.840> now

ten thousandths of an inch thick now

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.560 
ten thousandths of an inch thick now
I've<00:06:02.770> got<00:06:02.949> 30<00:06:03.250> or<00:06:03.400> 40<00:06:03.760> thousands<00:06:04.270> of<00:06:04.389> an<00:06:04.479> inch

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
thick and I can tell you from experience

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.050 
thick and I can tell you from experience
even<00:06:07.990> though<00:06:08.320> these<00:06:08.500> are<00:06:08.680> very<00:06:08.949> tough<00:06:09.340> tools

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
even though these are very tough tools

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.520 
even though these are very tough tools
and<00:06:10.479> as<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.690> said<00:06:10.750> they're<00:06:11.080> tougher<00:06:11.409> than

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
and as I said they're tougher than

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.890 
and as I said they're tougher than
woodpecker<00:06:11.889> lips<00:06:12.130> this<00:06:13.090> is<00:06:13.150> only<00:06:13.479> 50

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
woodpecker lips this is only 50

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.110 
woodpecker lips this is only 50
thousandths<00:06:14.380> of<00:06:14.440> an<00:06:14.560> inch<00:06:14.620> thick<00:06:14.919> it<00:06:15.490> will<00:06:15.699> not

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
thousandths of an inch thick it will not

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.080 
thousandths of an inch thick it will not
penetrate<00:06:16.800> two<00:06:17.800> or<00:06:18.039> three<00:06:18.280> or<00:06:18.400> four<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.789> these

penetrate two or three or four of these

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.779 
penetrate two or three or four of these
absolutely<00:06:19.720> not<00:06:20.020> so<00:06:20.289> by<00:06:20.889> doing<00:06:20.949> this<00:06:21.400> we<00:06:21.460> will

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
absolutely not so by doing this we will

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.990 
absolutely not so by doing this we will
never<00:06:22.000> bypass<00:06:22.599> this<00:06:22.990> lock<00:06:23.250> why<00:06:24.250> American

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
never bypass this lock why American

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.080 
never bypass this lock why American
doesn't<00:06:25.240> do<00:06:25.630> this<00:06:25.870> is<00:06:26.430> well<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.460> can<00:06:27.610> tell<00:06:27.940> you

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
doesn't do this is well I can tell you

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.629 
doesn't do this is well I can tell you
why<00:06:28.320> when<00:06:29.320> you<00:06:29.440> assemble<00:06:29.740> these<00:06:30.070> locks<00:06:30.340> it's

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
why when you assemble these locks it's

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.330 
why when you assemble these locks it's
not<00:06:30.940> easy<00:06:31.360> to<00:06:31.720> put<00:06:31.930> them<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.770> have<00:06:32.889> to<00:06:33.039> align

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
not easy to put them you have to align

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.670 
not easy to put them you have to align
them<00:06:33.550> and<00:06:33.750> then<00:06:34.750> slide<00:06:35.020> them<00:06:35.169> up<00:06:35.320> into<00:06:35.470> the

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
them and then slide them up into the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.529 
them and then slide them up into the
hole<00:06:35.830> and<00:06:36.099> if<00:06:36.400> you<00:06:36.669> don't<00:06:36.909> do<00:06:37.030> it<00:06:37.120> perfectly

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
hole and if you don't do it perfectly

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.969 
hole and if you don't do it perfectly
you'll<00:06:37.750> bump<00:06:37.990> them<00:06:38.199> in<00:06:38.320> these<00:06:38.440> discs<00:06:38.830> will

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
you'll bump them in these discs will

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:40.800 
you'll bump them in these discs will
fall<00:06:39.220> off<00:06:39.430> like<00:06:39.610> that<00:06:39.849> and<00:06:40.090> then<00:06:40.479> they<00:06:40.570> fall

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
fall off like that and then they fall

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.390 
fall off like that and then they fall
all<00:06:40.960> over<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.229> workbench<00:06:41.560> so<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.949> takes<00:06:42.159> extra

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
all over the workbench so it takes extra

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.200 
all over the workbench so it takes extra
assembly<00:06:43.150> time<00:06:43.360> to<00:06:43.599> get<00:06:43.720> it<00:06:43.840> together<00:06:45.030> you<00:06:46.030> can

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
assembly time to get it together you can

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.580 
assembly time to get it together you can
do<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.479> it<00:06:46.599> just<00:06:46.659> takes<00:06:47.020> a<00:06:47.110> cut<00:06:47.260> a<00:06:47.289> little<00:06:47.409> bit

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
do it it just takes a cut a little bit

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.260 
do it it just takes a cut a little bit
of<00:06:47.680> extra<00:06:47.889> time<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.159> little<00:06:48.400> bit<00:06:48.550> of<00:06:48.700> extra<00:06:48.940> care

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
of extra time a little bit of extra care

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.480 
of extra time a little bit of extra care
but<00:06:49.479> if<00:06:49.630> you<00:06:49.870> increase<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.830> number<00:06:50.860> of<00:06:51.099> pins

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
but if you increase the number of pins

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.719 
but if you increase the number of pins
six<00:06:51.759> and<00:06:52.000> you<00:06:52.599> increase<00:06:52.900> the<00:06:53.050> number<00:06:53.349> of

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
six and you increase the number of

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.689 
six and you increase the number of
wafers<00:06:54.729> to<00:06:55.259> three<00:06:56.259> or<00:06:56.530> even<00:06:56.590> four<00:06:56.979> it<00:06:57.520> will

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
wafers to three or even four it will

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.120 
wafers to three or even four it will
still<00:06:58.030> function<00:06:58.509> perfectly<00:06:58.889> except<00:06:59.889> now

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
still function perfectly except now

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.339 
still function perfectly except now
you've<00:07:00.550> delayed<00:07:01.030> the<00:07:01.509> intruder<00:07:01.990> that<00:07:02.139> much

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
you've delayed the intruder that much

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.320 
you've delayed the intruder that much
longer<00:07:02.590> and<00:07:02.919> you've<00:07:03.490> turned<00:07:03.699> a<00:07:03.880> good<00:07:03.910> lock

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
longer and you've turned a good lock

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.809 
longer and you've turned a good lock
into<00:07:04.780> an<00:07:04.870> excellent<00:07:05.500> lock<00:07:05.710> anyway<00:07:06.610> it<00:07:06.669> works

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819 
into an excellent lock anyway it works

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.999 
into an excellent lock anyway it works

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
on all America dialogues doesn't matter
