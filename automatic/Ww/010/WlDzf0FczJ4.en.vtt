 third edition of gamers de tv in 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.660
 This year after an exciting 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.790
 beginning of the year comes the games avalanche 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.649
 2010 now really rolling 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.090

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.770
 we want to be ahead of you 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.450
 this time skipped a whole month 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.710

 popping title from the release month of march 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.220
 a few years ago, weak trends 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.830
 and cultural property mainly from the usa 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.570
 to europe many of these days , especially 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.610
 with computer game fans also for 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.440
 Europeans partially digestible 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.010
 Japanese way of life more and more 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.200
 approval 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.420
 This may be the reason why 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.130
 After a long wait, sega finally hesitate 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.110
 decided to do the third part 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.740
 the courses also in europe on the market 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:23.350
 to throw 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:26.119
 [Music] 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.399
 while in 2005 at the 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.430
 Playstation 2 started series around the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.590
 former yakuza kazuma kiryu in japan 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.630
 have been in the fourth round goes 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.070
 we europeans after the rather unsuccessful 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.600
 and also very late 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.250
 predecessors long by one 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.310
 release of the playstation 3 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 exclusive title bank from 12 march may 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.520
 but we finally without import 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 version in the drive but with 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.009
 german subtitles by the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.080
 Japanese underworld streamers 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.939
 At the same time, we are at first depressed 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.590
 china where main character kazuma a 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.000
 orphanage opened and decided 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.860
 had past his mafia past 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.209
 to let oneself 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.500
 With much love he cares here 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.780
 both for the sake of his 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.890
 adoptive daughter haruka as well as around 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.530
 hurt and care diverse 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.700
 orphan kazuma apparently has his 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.750
 peace, joy and cake 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.540
 found 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.910
 that's the way it should be so it can stay that way 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.080
 but not like it is just like that 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.640
 the annoying shadow of the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 past not readily 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.720
 shake off and her kazuma pufferfish 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.670
 may be he is already back 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.769
 in the midst of criminal complications 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.780
 apparently had the location of his 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.299
 orphanage chosen something unhappy 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.310
 the nisa happens to belong to the local 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.739
 after and should be due to dubious 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.690
 political machinations calculated 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.400
 for the construction of a large holiday complex 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.900
 serve 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.640
 Kazuma, of course, refuses the land 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 for sale and as he states that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.660
 his old colleague diego somehow in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.489
 the whole affair is involved 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.959
 he has vigorously the nose full around 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.959
 decides to make nails with heads 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.069
 unceremoniously leaving the Okinawan and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.900
 returns to kamurocho one 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.670
 fictitious version of a red light district 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.160
 in tokyo and at the same time the setting 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.720
 from the first two yakuza share for 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.069
 the player opens up here with a 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.670
 already known from the predecessor 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.590
 advantage 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.480
 He is next to okinawa was a second 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.040
 complete district for disposal by 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.510
 in hofen as let off steam emissions 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.130
 By the way, how can you do things? 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.959
 prehistory the question mark on the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.180
 who can find help in the menu 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.920
 the game where in about 50 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.390
 minute film the main cutscenes 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 the predecessor can play and thus 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.049
 Bypass as well as yakuza 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.209
 buuntil ensures very closely going 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.590
 the first helmus kazuma now in twelve 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.459
 chap the most diverse 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.019
 solve tasks 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.030
 objects can be found in 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.910
 Street fighting claim and orders 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.370
 complete with over 100 side missions 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.680
 and 20 mini games like billiards karaoke 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.569
 and ok games are also available 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.250
 a decent package plays with 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.269
 the way 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.730
 unfortunately the story is weakening 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.860
 a total of some acts it was confusing 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.620
 and especially the tasks in the orphanage 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.060
 are a bit boring as action-hero 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.799
 you just do not want to be around the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.069
 Problems of pubescent nerve-sawing 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.069
 To take care of 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.630
 [Music] 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.520
 but do not worry the action is not coming 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.050
 too short then numerous innovations such as 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.880
 a direct entry into spontaneous 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.590
 fight various chases and 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.510
 steady learning new moves 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.130
 in yakuza 3 also neat the post 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.840
 especially the high degree 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.430
 Realism the game of exaggerated 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.739
 johndroe colleagues takes off and especially 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.150
 a huge gaudi is for japan fans and 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.650

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.270
 engine already for two years ago 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.030
 that has not appeared in europe 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.770
 on rio even goku was not used 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.780
