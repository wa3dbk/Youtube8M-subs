00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
set up in a situation where you're

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210 
set up in a situation where you're

parallel to your intended flight line so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.370 
parallel to your intended flight line so
just<00:00:23.550> order<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> couple<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> lines<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.810> that's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
just order a couple of lines here that's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.509 
just order a couple of lines here that's
the<00:00:25.560> direction<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.890> models<00:00:26.130> wanting<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> hit

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
the direction of models wanting to hit

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.670 
the direction of models wanting to hit
the<00:00:26.640> ball<00:00:26.789> notice<00:00:27.240> how<00:00:27.390> he's<00:00:27.539> body<00:00:28.199> lineament

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the ball notice how he's body lineament

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.620 
the ball notice how he's body lineament
is<00:00:28.890> parallel<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.000> by<00:00:30.150> body<00:00:30.420> long<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
is parallel to that so by body long I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.130 
is parallel to that so by body long I
mean<00:00:30.869> toes<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:32.070> line<00:00:32.099> hipline<00:00:33.090> shoulder<00:00:33.960> line

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
mean toes the line hipline shoulder line

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.870 
mean toes the line hipline shoulder line
really<00:00:34.890> better<00:00:35.040> after<00:00:35.160> work<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> heels

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
really better after work on the heels

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.450 
really better after work on the heels
because<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.840> taken<00:00:37.170> shift<00:00:37.440> around<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:39.170> and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
because it taken shift around a bit and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
because it taken shift around a bit and
he'll<00:00:41.460> line<00:00:41.700> parallel<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.210> target<00:00:42.600> line<00:00:42.750> let's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
he'll line parallel to target line let's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.229 
he'll line parallel to target line let's
get<00:00:43.590> rid<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.030> now<00:00:45.030> you'll<00:00:45.210> notice

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
get rid of that one now you'll notice

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.830 
get rid of that one now you'll notice
over<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> models<00:00:47.489> got<00:00:47.640> he's<00:00:47.809> inside<00:00:48.809> of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
over here the models got he's inside of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
over here the models got he's inside of
his<00:00:49.020> feet<00:00:49.230> shoulders<00:00:49.559> width<00:00:49.680> apart<00:00:49.940> for<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
his feet shoulders width apart for a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.479 
his feet shoulders width apart for a
five<00:00:51.270> iron<00:00:51.480> ball<00:00:52.050> position<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.219> slightly

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
five iron ball position is just slightly

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.330 
five iron ball position is just slightly
forward<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> centre<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> middle<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> stance

forward of centre of middle of stance

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.060 
forward of centre of middle of stance
now<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.449> play<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> too<00:00:58.050> far<00:00:58.350> forward<00:00:58.739> in

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
now if you play it too far forward in

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
now if you play it too far forward in
the<00:00:59.219> stance<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.730> other<00:00:59.850> words<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.239> he<00:01:00.270> was

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the stance in other words if he was

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.630 
the stance in other words if he was
playing<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> ball<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> almost

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
playing the ball up here which is almost

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.810 
playing the ball up here which is almost
a<00:01:02.850> driver<00:01:03.090> position<00:01:03.680> what<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.250> cause

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
a driver position what that would cause

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.910 
a driver position what that would cause
is<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.420> him<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.750> actually<00:01:06.990> open<00:01:07.530> his

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is for him to actually open his

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580 
is for him to actually open his
shoulders<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> target<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
shoulders up to target if it was a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
shoulders up to target if it was a
player<00:01:10.950> too<00:01:11.189> far<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> right<00:01:12.360> heel

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
player too far back off the right heel

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
player too far back off the right heel
and<00:01:13.020> move<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> club<00:01:14.100> back<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> set<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and move the club back and set it to the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.960 
and move the club back and set it to the
ball<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.299> would<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.840> shoulders<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
ball it would put these shoulders in a

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.820 
ball it would put these shoulders in a
closed-off<00:01:17.970> position<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.600> aiming<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
closed-off position or aiming out to the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
closed-off position or aiming out to the
right<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.189> target<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.820> too<00:01:21.240> far<00:01:21.450> forward<00:01:21.750> sets

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
right of target so too far forward sets

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.499 
right of target so too far forward sets
you<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.549> left<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.700> target<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.090> shoulder

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you up for left to target with shoulder

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.160 
you up for left to target with shoulder
line<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> too<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:25.950> back<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.580> set<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.000> up

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
line and too far back would set you up

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
line and too far back would set you up
too<00:01:28.170> far<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.130> your<00:01:29.250> shoulders<00:01:29.610> for

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
too far right with your shoulders for

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240 
too far right with your shoulders for
target<00:01:30.119> line<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.479> has<00:01:30.710> ramifications<00:01:31.710> on

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
target line that has ramifications on

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
target line that has ramifications on
your<00:01:32.369> swing<00:01:32.549> plane<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.630> ability<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.079> get

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
your swing plane and your ability to get

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
your swing plane and your ability to get
back<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.680> critical<00:01:35.189> top<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> backswing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
back to that critical top of backswing

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.170 
back to that critical top of backswing
position<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> simply<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
position so think of it simply as the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840 
position so think of it simply as the
geometry<00:01:40.140> involved<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> teach<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.759> when

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
geometry involved when I teach them when

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.219 
geometry involved when I teach them when
I<00:01:41.880> fit<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.420> fitting<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> equipment

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I fit and fitting of equipment

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.690 
I fit and fitting of equipment
incidentally<00:01:43.680> has<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> big<00:01:44.159> bearing<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.579> this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
incidentally has a big bearing on this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030 
incidentally has a big bearing on this
because<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.119> affects<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.479> posture<00:01:46.040> lengthen

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just remove a couple of those lines so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.660 
just remove a couple of those lines so
we<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.450> tidy<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.830> get<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> driver

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
we could tidy it up as you get to driver

right-hander but the shoulders would

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.260 
right-hander but the shoulders would

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
still be parallel to target line so

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.370 
still be parallel to target line so
