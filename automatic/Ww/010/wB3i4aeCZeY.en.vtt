00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 but wow, my punch is baby 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.580
 trainees internet mobbing children this 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
 droid point ru you know I'll start with 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 stories a couple of years ago I'm away from this 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.099
 I thought a strange hat and wondered why it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.590
 need from a war on me should 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.750
 save and what if business with what to wear over 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 Today I understood that she needed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 make create in order to write 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.600
 review on the world of tanks for sure you 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.490
 heard that the world of tanks blitz and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 mobile version of a popular toy 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 finally came out on android and now we 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.640
 look not and see what it is 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.450
 changed from the first version 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.730
 which came out you drove the first 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.100
 version of the world of tanks blitz came out for 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.629
 platform and with about six months ago for 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.879
 this time is already very big 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.480
 more than 10 popular games 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.090
 million 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.489
 Installed came running early December she 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.960
 came out under android find it very easy in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.210
 You can of course write to the market in the search 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 You can write in the search and you can go to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.280
 application and in the top free and here it is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.770
 in second place immediately after my 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.830
 Talking Angela I have a game already 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.420
 installed and let's run take a look 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 on android immediately came updated 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 version of the game 1.5 and ios it too 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.960
 refreshed, a new map of the new 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.729
 improved British nationality 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 graphics and we other nishtyakov now I them 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.549
 I'll try to prove myself 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 represents the game in principle game genre 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.369
 m. m. 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.070
 action, that is, the mass in the megalopolis action 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.299
 gameplay consists of fights that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 you can enter 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.329
 One after another, the battle is two teams 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.820
 seed man for 7 people and lasts seven 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.619
 minutes this is such a fairly simple idea 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 separate respect to the developers for 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.159
 realistic in terms of being creating 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.829
 military equipment that is there in the game 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 4 nationalities of the USA are represented 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.280
 Germany, the USSR and Great Britain 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.810
 it's cool that the British have appeared 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 first tank was created and uk 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.479
 There were two species of male and female 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.399
 the male was a gun at the female was a machine gun 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.119
 then it turned out that the female type 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.460
 ineffective 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.290
 and made a new hybrid version on 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.939
 the left side of the cannon is located on the right 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.799
 machine gun if this thing was called 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.090
 hermaphrodite such a first tank in history 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.439
 there was such a cool thing 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.450
 called the tank tree of all there are four 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.459
 types of combat vehicles are light medium and 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 heavy tanks and anti-tank machine 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.890
 I have a complicated attitude to games that 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.110
 adapt 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.340
 their platform to mobile as a rule 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.470
 get some kind of incomprehensible 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.540
 orgy with bad management 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.069
 adapts the schedule all max payne and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.830
 which go out for mobile devices 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.350
 bio shock seems to me this terrible horror and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.600
 just this shame and draining money from 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.490
 fans but the case of sword of tanks 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.430
 I really like how everything was adapted 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.290
 ideas all the big game buns and made 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 new is actually completely different but 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.650
 using all these cool tricks 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.000
 first mobile game is very good 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.819
 mobile graphics 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 weather appeared and other nishtyaki in 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.930
 the second is very cool what they did 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 short fights of only 7 minutes is comfortable 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.360
 a short session just for 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.519
 mobile device you can catch 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.410
 even in the subway to play if there is Wi-Fi 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.580
 You can play in the bus through 3g 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 you can of course at home between lunch and go 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.410
 take a walk down the street at the moment you have 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.340
 button on the screen to start the fight and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.769
 press and drove well that's all 14 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.390
 players gathered a team of greenbacks 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.820
 against the reds team management 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.010
 very understandable from the left we 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.940
 driving a30 tank left 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.739
 green arrow show 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.380
 direction he moves the right side 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.450
 the screen we have rotates the tower and its own 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.110
 gun can fell trees here and so I 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.810
 honestly 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.160
 fairly inexperienced user player 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.239
 but wow, my punch is the baby where to go 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.530
 where but unfortunately I lost the battle and 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.940
 By the way in terms of graphics is very correct 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.440
 here did she adapt 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.780
 depending on whom and device 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.510
 if you run a more powerful device 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.640
 more beautiful that glows are reflected yes 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.290
 him particles and so on well, and if you're on 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.090
 Kama in the very smartphones start something 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.680
 everything will be easier to look of course but 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.209
 top priority is game speed 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.290
 that was not lags and it seems to me 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.420
 very correct when you are not with anyone 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.640
 fighting the main screen of the game this here 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.500
 you can buy this hangar here 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.880
 improvements for tanks pump them 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.920
 evolve to the next more 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.049
 advanced versions and you can 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.390
 manage the crews then you too new 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.190
 chip that appeared after the update 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.810
 Of course there is donat but actually 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.780
 he is not obliged to anything 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.410
 completely calm on my own 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.660
 pumped upgrade 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.329
 and win the battle now I will choose 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.590
 heavy tank perhaps this british 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.570
 because I am a lamer 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.400
 and for me it is important that their armor was dofiga 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.590
 stand still and try to be in someone 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.050
 shoot let's try this 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.160
 will happen very quickly 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.380
 equipment of the fight because here already 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.350
 a large base of players around the world have 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.840
 there are 12 cards + 1 teaching them to save 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.840
 big enough big can teach 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.190
 need to go with someone guys 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.290
 gangbang some sort of something else 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.800
 In fact this is a tactful game 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.650
 will appear 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.090
 it's not just some kind of 3d person 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.920
 faster who will kill a lot here 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.530
 tactical nuances due to different 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.600
 classes of combat vehicles you can perform 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.910
 different tasks and differently help 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.100
 his comrade is not only so stupid 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.590
 arcade faster move the best shoot 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.270
 but on real you need to think what 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.430
 position choose which tanks 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.500
 comrades will teach to move together wow 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:13.100
 which is not a machine gun view of the paw of the market about 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.330
 yeah baby so mess with these 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.310
 british russian multiplayer here 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.160
 not only works inside android or 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.010
 inside with a between two platform I even 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.140
 I heard that the developers had an idea 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.940
 time battle on the tank to display the informer 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.830
 which will show from what 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.540
 device sky platform man playing 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.040
 to all the extra intrigue is 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.690
 confrontation to make it seems to me very 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.460
 cool can be and realizes and I 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.140
 it seems flunked 2 tanks and 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.390
 the battle is over we won it statistics 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.670
 fight you can see how many points you 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.380
 got what you have done i killed two 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.330
 tank i-7 by the way I am the second time in 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.130
 life you played in world of tanks and 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.140
 someone is very cool because sort of 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.230
 it would seem at first that it is difficult enough 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.450
 win but a little twist as 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.000
 it is possible to aim everything 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.220
 make a nice comfortable mechanic just 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.110
 play just enough to enter and start 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.580
 play and need to bother much 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.470
 by some distributors and so on that 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.270
 As for the minuses, the first is probably 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.590
 is that you constantly 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.150
 need internet to play 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.740
 the question is because this is a political 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.870
 the game is someone that has high requirements 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.640
 graphics but actually on the device 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.980
 which are younger than two years 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.030
 the game is quite a stable shorter 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.320
 saying if you have a smartphone and 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.200
 tablet and terribly want to play 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.080
 anything real man 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.370
 native wasp live people from the internet then 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.700
 try it seems to me very good 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.680
 option 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.290
 world of tanks blitz is now finally on 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.910
 android and dobovlyaytes can be with 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.560
 by you too 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.360
 let's be born together thanks for watching 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.280
 review ever residence cavalry 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.280
 seam and see you future
