irrespective of what they actually do

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.030 
irrespective of what they actually do
and<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:21.390> I've<00:02:21.690> said<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.260> many<00:02:22.410> years<00:02:22.620> tax<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and so I've said for many years tax the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440 
and so I've said for many years tax the
church's<00:02:23.400> tax<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> church<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.030> accident

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
church's tax the church this accident

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.980 
church's tax the church this accident
churches<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.640> think

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
churches and it's not because I think

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.200 
churches and it's not because I think
churches<00:02:27.990> are<00:02:28.640> unworthy<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:30.030> tax<00:02:30.690> exemptions

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
churches are unworthy of tax exemptions

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.790 
churches are unworthy of tax exemptions
my<00:02:33.350> understanding<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.450> many<00:02:36.450> churches

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
my understanding is that many churches

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.040 
my understanding is that many churches
probably<00:02:37.800> do<00:02:38.420> contribute<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.660> their

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
probably do contribute to their

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.940 
probably do contribute to their
communities<00:02:41.270> build<00:02:42.270> communities<00:02:43.080> encourage

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
communities build communities encourage

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.980 
communities build communities encourage
a<00:02:44.310> lot<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.240> sort<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.480> things<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.900> would

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
a lot of the sort of things that would

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.890 
a lot of the sort of things that would
qualify<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.560> tax<00:02:46.890> exemption<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:48.450> problem<00:02:48.810> is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
qualify for tax exemption the problem is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.970 
qualify for tax exemption the problem is
that<00:02:49.050> they<00:02:49.170> don't<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.650> make<00:02:49.800> any

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that they don't have to make any

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.440 
that they don't have to make any
demonstration<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:51.030> they're<00:02:51.180> actually

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
demonstration that they're actually

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.700 
demonstration that they're actually
doing<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:51.810> they<00:02:51.990> just<00:02:52.200> say<00:02:52.290> oh<00:02:52.500> we're

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
doing this they just say oh we're

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.470 
doing this they just say oh we're
religion<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.670> get<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.910> tax-exempt

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
religion and they get the tax-exempt

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.320 
religion and they get the tax-exempt
status<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:56.100> should<00:02:56.460> be<00:02:56.640> if<00:02:56.880> they're<00:02:57.030> actually

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
status it should be if they're actually

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.400
