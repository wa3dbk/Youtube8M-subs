I<00:00:20.779> think<00:00:22.460> that<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:24.289> unrepentant<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:26.430> belief

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I think that is unrepentant on my belief

I think that is unrepentant on my belief
okay<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.890> go<00:00:29.429> back<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> Karis<00:00:30.029> point<00:00:30.269> what

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
okay but to go back to Karis point what

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.970 
okay but to go back to Karis point what
would<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.960> each<00:00:31.080> imagine<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> would

you'll do dramatically more reading
nights<00:01:34.659> off<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.380> yeah<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.549> mean<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.759> believe

in<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.240> tablet<00:01:37.600> form<00:01:37.840> factor<00:01:37.899> I<00:01:38.439> think<00:01:38.979> you'll

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
in the tablet form factor I think you'll

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.980 
in the tablet form factor I think you'll
have<00:01:39.280> voice<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.850> think<00:01:39.909> they<00:01:40.119> have<00:01:40.270> Inc<00:01:40.600> you'll

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.429 
combine in there you know there's
navigation<00:01:53.640> computers<00:01:54.959> there's<00:01:55.959> media

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
navigation computers there's media

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.940 
navigation computers there's media
there's<00:01:56.860> foam<00:01:58.349> technology<00:01:59.349> is<00:01:59.439> letting<00:01:59.799> us

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
there's foam technology is letting us

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.589 
there's foam technology is letting us
put<00:02:00.189> more<00:02:00.429> things<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.880> there<00:02:01.119> but<00:02:01.360> then<00:02:01.479> again

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
put more things in there but then again

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.809 
put more things in there but then again
you<00:02:01.929> really<00:02:02.079> want<00:02:02.349> to<00:02:02.470> tune<00:02:02.709> it<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.489> people

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
you really want to tune it so people

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.190 
you really want to tune it so people
know<00:02:03.970> what<00:02:04.119> they<00:02:04.299> expect<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:04.810> there's<00:02:04.989> quite<00:02:05.170> a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
know what they expect so there's quite a

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.719 
know what they expect so there's quite a
bit<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.439> experimentation<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.610> that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
bit of experimentation in that

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.880 
bit of experimentation in that
pocket-sized<00:02:07.390> device<00:02:07.689> but<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.530> think<00:02:08.709> those

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
pocket-sized device but I think those

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.490 
pocket-sized device but I think those
are<00:02:09.039> natural<00:02:09.220> form<00:02:09.670> factors<00:02:10.230> then<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.410> will

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
are natural form factors then that will

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.900 
are natural form factors then that will
have<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.769> evolution<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.519> portable

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
have the evolution of the portable

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.240 
have the evolution of the portable
machine<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.349> evolution<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.980> foam

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
machine and the evolution of the foam

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.110 
machine and the evolution of the foam
will<00:02:15.879> both<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.329> extremely<00:02:17.140> high<00:02:17.319> volume

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
will both be extremely high volume

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.039 
will both be extremely high volume
complimentary<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.299> is<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.720> own<00:02:19.840> one

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
complimentary that is if you own one

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.050 
complimentary that is if you own one
you're<00:02:20.200> more<00:02:20.319> likely<00:02:20.530> than<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:20.980> other<00:02:21.130> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you're more likely than the other and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.059 
you're more likely than the other and
then<00:02:22.209> at<00:02:22.299> home<00:02:22.420> you'd<00:02:22.600> have<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.950> setup<00:02:23.950> that

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
then at home you'd have a setup that

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.759 
then at home you'd have a setup that
they<00:02:24.190> all<00:02:24.310> plug<00:02:24.549> into<00:02:24.730> well<00:02:25.209> at<00:02:25.389> home<00:02:25.769> you'll

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
they all plug into well at home you'll

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.319 
they all plug into well at home you'll
have<00:02:26.829> your<00:02:27.220> living<00:02:27.430> room<00:02:27.790> which<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> your

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
have your living room which is your

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.690 
have your living room which is your
10-foot<00:02:28.959> experience<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:30.069> that's<00:02:30.130> connected

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
10-foot experience and that's connected

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.270 
10-foot experience and that's connected
up<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.299> Internet<00:02:31.889> and<00:02:32.889> there<00:02:33.100> you'll<00:02:33.220> have

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
up to the Internet and there you'll have

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.849 
up to the Internet and there you'll have
gaming<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.329> entertainment<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:35.200> there's<00:02:35.799> a

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
gaming and entertainment and there's a

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.680 
gaming and entertainment and there's a
lot<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.160> experimentation<00:02:36.850> in<00:02:37.150> terms<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.510> what

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
lot of experimentation in terms of what

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.129 
lot of experimentation in terms of what
content<00:02:38.650> looks<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.549> world<00:02:40.139> and

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
content looks like in that world and

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.020 
content looks like in that world and
then<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.709> your<00:02:41.829> Daniel<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.400> something<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.880> lot

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
then in your Daniel have something a lot

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.059 
then in your Daniel have something a lot
like<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.389> have<00:02:43.540> at<00:02:43.630> your<00:02:43.750> desk<00:02:44.019> at<00:02:44.200> work<00:02:44.230> you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
know the view is that every horizontal

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.300 
know the view is that every horizontal
and<00:02:47.139> vertical<00:02:47.560> surface<00:02:48.010> will<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.280> a

devices you'll carry you know it's

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.780 
devices you'll carry you know it's
interesting<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:11.019> PC<00:03:11.650> has<00:03:11.919> proved<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.519> very

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
interesting the PC has proved to be very

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.000 
interesting the PC has proved to be very
resilient<00:03:13.269> because<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:14.230> bill<00:03:14.410> said<00:03:14.680> earlier<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
resilient because as bill said earlier I

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.259 
resilient because as bill said earlier I
mean<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.220> death<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.639> PC<00:03:16.000> has<00:03:16.120> been

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
mean the death of the PC has been

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.690 
mean the death of the PC has been
predicted<00:03:16.859> every<00:03:17.859> few<00:03:18.069> years<00:03:18.280> here<00:03:18.519> when

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
predicted every few years here when

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.879 
predicted every few years here when
you're<00:03:18.849> saying<00:03:19.120> PC<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.780> mean<00:03:19.959> personal

while was getting a little stale and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.810 
while was getting a little stale and
then<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> internet<00:03:37.359> came<00:03:37.389> along<00:03:37.720> right<00:03:38.259> and

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
then the internet came along right and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.099 
then the internet came along right and
everybody<00:03:39.820> needed<00:03:40.030> more<00:03:40.239> powerful<00:03:40.690> computers

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
everybody needed more powerful computers

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.509 
everybody needed more powerful computers
to<00:03:41.199> get<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.470> internet<00:03:41.680> browsers<00:03:42.310> came

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
to get on the internet browsers came

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.159 
to get on the internet browsers came
along<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.060> was<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.269> whole<00:03:43.419> internet<00:03:43.780> age

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
along and it was this whole internet age

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.900 
along and it was this whole internet age
that<00:03:44.530> came<00:03:44.709> along<00:03:44.949> access<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.609> Internet

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
that came along access to the Internet

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.650 
that came along access to the Internet
and<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:47.139> then<00:03:47.889> some<00:03:48.519> number<00:03:48.789> years<00:03:49.000> ago<00:03:49.329> you

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
and and then some number years ago you

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.990 
and and then some number years ago you
could<00:03:49.840> start<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.169> see<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.250> PC<00:03:51.669> that<00:03:51.820> was

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
could start to see that the PC that was

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.550 
could start to see that the PC that was
taken<00:03:52.299> for<00:03:52.479> granted<00:03:52.509> things<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.259> kind<00:03:53.470> of

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
taken for granted things that kind of

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.520 
taken for granted things that kind of
plateaued<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> little<00:03:54.789> bit<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.530> innovation

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
plateaued a little bit and innovation

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.409 
plateaued a little bit and innovation
wise<00:03:56.680> at<00:03:56.859> least<00:03:57.039> and<00:03:57.220> then<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.579> think<00:03:58.299> this

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
wise at least and then I think this

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.749 
wise at least and then I think this
whole<00:03:58.570> notion<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.829> PC<00:04:00.190> we<00:04:00.340> called<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.669> the

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:00.759 
whole notion of the PC we called it the

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.340 
whole notion of the PC we called it the
digital<00:04:01.120> hub<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.660> call<00:04:01.870> any<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.139> want

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
digital hub but you call any you want

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.289 
digital hub but you call any you want
sort<00:04:02.919> of<00:04:03.070> multimedia<00:04:03.639> center<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.150> house

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
sort of multimedia center of the house

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.719 
sort of multimedia center of the house
started<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.109> take<00:04:05.410> off<00:04:05.590> with<00:04:05.889> digital<00:04:06.280> cameras

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
started to take off with digital cameras

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.400 
started to take off with digital cameras
and<00:04:06.759> digital<00:04:07.209> camcorders<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:07.930> sharing

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
and digital camcorders and sharing

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.719 
and digital camcorders and sharing
things<00:04:08.590> over<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.859> internet<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.280> kind<00:04:09.669> of

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
things over the internet and kind of

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.340 
things over the internet and kind of
needing<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:10.000> repository<00:04:10.780> for<00:04:10.959> all<00:04:11.079> that<00:04:11.229> stuff

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
needing a repository for all that stuff

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.219 
needing a repository for all that stuff
and<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:12.370> was<00:04:12.459> reborn<00:04:12.910> again<00:04:13.030> as<00:04:13.419> sort<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.169> the

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
and it was reborn again as sort of the

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.939 
and it was reborn again as sort of the
hub<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.440> your<00:04:14.560> digital<00:04:14.919> life<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:17.769> can

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
hub of your digital life and you can

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.439 
hub of your digital life and you can
sort<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.310> see<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.549> there's<00:04:19.150> something

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
sort of see that there's something

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.479 
sort of see that there's something
starting<00:04:20.079> again<00:04:20.380> it's<00:04:20.650> not<00:04:20.799> clear<00:04:20.859> exactly

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
starting again it's not clear exactly

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.050 
starting again it's not clear exactly
what<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:21.960> but<00:04:23.009> it<00:04:24.009> will<00:04:24.160> be<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.400> PC<00:04:24.820> maybe

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
what it is but it will be the PC maybe

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.060 
what it is but it will be the PC maybe
used<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.509> little<00:04:25.690> more<00:04:25.750> tightly<00:04:26.530> coupled<00:04:26.860> with

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
used a little more tightly coupled with

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.890 
used a little more tightly coupled with
some<00:04:27.280> back-end<00:04:27.520> internet<00:04:28.120> services<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.780> some

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
some back-end internet services and some

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.719 
some back-end internet services and some
things<00:04:29.110> like<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.680> course<00:04:29.740> PCs<00:04:30.580> are

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
things like that and of course PCs are

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.460 
things like that and of course PCs are
going<00:04:30.970> mobile<00:04:31.180> in<00:04:31.479> an<00:04:31.570> ever<00:04:31.780> greater<00:04:32.050> degree

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
going mobile in an ever greater degree

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.650 
going mobile in an ever greater degree
so<00:04:32.949> I<00:04:32.979> think<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.400> PC<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:34.000> going<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.210> continue

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
so I think the PC is going to continue

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.659 
so I think the PC is going to continue
this<00:04:34.750> general-purpose<00:04:35.410> device<00:04:35.889> is<00:04:36.160> going<00:04:36.610> to

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
this general-purpose device is going to

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.270 
this general-purpose device is going to
continue<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.270> be<00:04:38.020> with<00:04:38.169> us<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.620> morph<00:04:38.979> with<00:04:39.160> us

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
continue to be with us and morph with us

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.010 
continue to be with us and morph with us
whether<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.789> tablet<00:04:40.030> or<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.389> notebook<00:04:40.630> or<00:04:40.930> a

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
whether it's a tablet or a notebook or a

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.050 
whether it's a tablet or a notebook or a
you<00:04:41.500> know<00:04:41.530> big<00:04:41.860> curved<00:04:42.220> desktop<00:04:42.819> that<00:04:43.000> you

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
you know big curved desktop that you

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.129 
you know big curved desktop that you
have<00:04:43.210> at<00:04:43.300> your<00:04:43.360> house<00:04:43.539> or<00:04:43.750> whatever<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.050> might

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
have at your house or whatever it might

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.930 
have at your house or whatever it might
be<00:04:44.199> so<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:45.069> think<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.340> will<00:04:45.430> be<00:04:45.460> something

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
be so I think that will be something

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.309 
be so I think that will be something
that<00:04:46.060> most<00:04:46.210> people<00:04:46.569> have<00:04:46.720> at<00:04:46.900> least<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.229> this

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
that most people have at least in this

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.870 
that most people have at least in this
society<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:47.919> others<00:04:48.160> maybe<00:04:48.490> not<00:04:48.729> but

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
society and others maybe not but

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.180 
society and others maybe not but
certainly<00:04:49.210> in<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:49.419> one<00:04:49.569> but<00:04:50.440> then<00:04:50.650> there's

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
certainly in this one but then there's

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.640 
certainly in this one but then there's
an<00:04:51.340> explosion

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
an explosion

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.770 
an explosion
that's<00:04:53.650> starting<00:04:53.889> to<00:04:54.100> happen<00:04:54.340> in<00:04:54.789> these<00:04:55.300> what

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
that's starting to happen in these what

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.409 
that's starting to happen in these what

you call post-pc devices right and you

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.710 
you call post-pc devices right and you
call<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.810> iPod<00:04:59.199> one<00:04:59.440> of<00:04:59.560> them<00:05:00.389> there's<00:05:01.389> a<00:05:01.479> lot

call the iPod one of them there's a lot

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.570 
call the iPod one of them there's a lot

well<00:05:14.560> anyway<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:14.979> think<00:05:15.220> there's<00:05:15.610> just<00:05:15.729> a

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
well anyway I think there's just a

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.930 
well anyway I think there's just a
category<00:05:16.479> of<00:05:16.600> devices<00:05:17.139> that<00:05:17.350> aren't<00:05:17.590> as

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
category of devices that aren't as

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.450 
category of devices that aren't as
general-purpose<00:05:19.289> that<00:05:20.289> aren't<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:21.340> are

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
general-purpose that aren't that are

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.129 
general-purpose that aren't that are
they're<00:05:21.699> really<00:05:21.910> more<00:05:22.030> focused<00:05:22.300> on<00:05:22.660> specific

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
they're really more focused on specific

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.659 
they're really more focused on specific
functions<00:05:23.590> whether<00:05:23.770> they're<00:05:23.979> phones<00:05:24.280> or

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
functions whether they're phones or

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.689 
functions whether they're phones or
iPods<00:05:25.090> or<00:05:25.360> zooms<00:05:25.690> or<00:05:26.110> what-have-you<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:27.190> I

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
iPods or zooms or what-have-you and I

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.270 
iPods or zooms or what-have-you and I
think<00:05:27.910> that<00:05:28.569> category<00:05:29.139> devices<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:29.860> starting

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
think that category devices is starting

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.659 
think that category devices is starting
is<00:05:31.000> going<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.330> continue<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.740> be<00:05:32.860> very

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
is going to continue to to be very

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.219 
is going to continue to to be very
innovative<00:05:33.939> and<00:05:34.330> we're<00:05:34.569> gonna<00:05:34.659> see<00:05:34.810> lots<00:05:35.080> of

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
innovative and we're gonna see lots of

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.140 
innovative and we're gonna see lots of
it<00:05:35.409> meaning<00:05:35.680> an<00:05:35.889> example<00:05:36.580> of<00:05:36.639> what<00:05:36.939> it<00:05:37.029> would

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
it meaning an example of what it would

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.030 
it meaning an example of what it would
that<00:05:37.270> would<00:05:37.389> be<00:05:37.419> well<00:05:37.960> an<00:05:38.110> iPod<00:05:38.469> has<00:05:38.590> opposed
