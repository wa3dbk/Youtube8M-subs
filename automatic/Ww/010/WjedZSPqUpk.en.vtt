encouraging SI weyn make some shots and
do<00:02:12.599> some<00:02:12.780> things<00:02:13.019> today<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:15.629> know<00:02:15.720> our<00:02:15.810> bench

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
do some things today you know our bench

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.630 
do some things today you know our bench
can<00:02:16.260> certainly<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.709> better<00:02:16.950> especially<00:02:17.310> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
can certainly get better especially on

can certainly get better especially on
the<00:02:17.730> perimeter<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.120> think<00:02:18.299> our<00:02:18.390> interior<00:02:18.959> bench

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the perimeter I think our interior bench

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.869 
the perimeter I think our interior bench
has<00:02:19.319> been<00:02:19.500> great<00:02:19.769> but<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.730> we're

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
has been great but you know we're

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.309 
has been great but you know we're
getting<00:02:21.030> better<00:02:21.180> we're<00:02:21.629> still<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> long<00:02:22.080> ways

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
getting better we're still a long ways

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.680 
getting better we're still a long ways
away<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.920> i<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.910> think<00:02:24.269> they're<00:02:24.390> starting

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
away but I i do think they're starting

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
I played in college for a while but I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.729 
I played in college for a while but I
had<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.510> learn<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.690> system<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.500> knew<00:02:43.650> those

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
had to learn the system it I knew those

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.170 
had to learn the system it I knew those
things<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.160> was<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.489> go<00:02:44.610> through<00:02:44.819> and
