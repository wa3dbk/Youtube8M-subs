00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.190
 wood script

 receive a visual receipt but a lot 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.050
 people are very unhappy with this 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.270
 rigor because it says that they have destroyed 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.040
 troupe law that is no longer the same triple 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.250

 I do not know I like it, I like it a lot 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.540
 design they have done to him but I do not know 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.820
 why are people a lot of people 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.160
 unhappy in the law forums there 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 a lot of people complaining 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.750

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.030
 stayed but many people have been 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.430
 unhappy because it seems that they have 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.250
 made as more more human than it was 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.590
 If before he was a troll, now he's 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.899
 a human so to speak there are many 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.460
 People who did not like me to lose their 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.700
 essence of who had that character 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.800
 but good to me honestly I like me 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.970

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.190
