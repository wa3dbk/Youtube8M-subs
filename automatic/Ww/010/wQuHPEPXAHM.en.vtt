two of the images for you in this demo
so<00:02:05.689> there<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> appetizers

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
image that I want to use if I just click

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.800 
image that I want to use if I just click
select<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.540> image

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
select that's there so then is the image

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.550 
select that's there so then is the image
of<00:02:12.900> parallax<00:02:13.260> by

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
of parallax by

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.729 
of parallax by
ground<00:02:13.920> image<00:02:14.640> yes<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.290> and

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
ground image yes we want it to be and

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.979 
ground image yes we want it to be and
then<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.430> parallax<00:02:17.880> speed<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.959> a

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
then the parallax speed so this is a

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.410 
then the parallax speed so this is a
this<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.410> value<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.220> from<00:02:21.030> naught<00:02:21.209> point

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
this is a value of not from naught point

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.350 
this is a value of not from naught point
1<00:02:21.690> up<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.170> 1<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.489> will<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.849> sleep<00:02:24.120> we'll

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
1 up to 1 so we will just sleep we'll

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.910 
1 up to 1 so we will just sleep we'll
leave<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.599> at<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> default<00:02:24.840> naught<00:02:25.319> point<00:02:25.530> 6

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
leave it at the default naught point 6

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.089 
leave it at the default naught point 6
satisfy<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.940> update<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.920> then

content so if I save that now and then
we<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.860> page<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.900> then<00:03:19.140> if<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.410> go

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
we up there that page and then if we go

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.800 
we up there that page and then if we go
on<00:03:19.650> refresh<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.380> actual<00:03:22.709> page<00:03:23.720> you'll<00:03:24.720> see

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.140 

I'm<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.680> different<00:07:03.070> headings<00:07:03.280> or<00:07:03.730> number<00:07:04.120> of

past<00:07:04.480> six<00:07:04.810> will<00:07:05.020> say<00:07:05.260> Paul<00:07:05.620> said<00:07:05.860> II<00:07:05.890> so<00:07:06.430> we'll

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
past six will say Paul said II so we'll

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.010 
past six will say Paul said II so we'll
leave<00:07:06.700> that<00:07:06.880> there<00:07:06.940> number<00:07:07.360> of<00:07:07.420> columns<00:07:07.780> one

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
leave that there number of columns one

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.540 
leave that there number of columns one
so<00:07:08.500> he<00:07:08.620> could<00:07:08.740> this<00:07:08.860> is<00:07:09.010> where<00:07:09.190> you<00:07:09.280> can<00:07:09.400> edit

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
so he could this is where you can edit

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.700 
so he could this is where you can edit
and<00:07:09.760> change<00:07:09.820> the<00:07:10.210> columns<00:07:10.600> so<00:07:11.200> like<00:07:11.410> on<00:07:11.590> our

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
and change the columns so like on our

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.360 
and change the columns so like on our
demo<00:07:12.010> we've<00:07:12.730> got<00:07:12.940> a<00:07:12.970> two<00:07:13.450> color<00:07:13.690> menu<00:07:14.050> or<00:07:14.860> you

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
demo we've got a two color menu or you

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.960 
demo we've got a two color menu or you
can<00:07:15.520> have<00:07:15.700> a<00:07:15.970> one<00:07:16.480> color<00:07:16.720> menu<00:07:17.610> so<00:07:18.610> there's<00:07:18.820> the

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
can have a one color menu so there's the

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.610 
can have a one color menu so there's the
one<00:07:19.120> color<00:07:19.360> menu<00:07:19.630> so<00:07:19.960> that's<00:07:20.140> where<00:07:20.380> you<00:07:20.500> would

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
one color menu so that's where you would

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.920 
one color menu so that's where you would
set<00:07:20.890> that<00:07:21.160> in<00:07:21.670> here<00:07:22.000> so<00:07:22.240> we'll<00:07:22.390> keep<00:07:22.540> it<00:07:22.660> at<00:07:22.780> two

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
set that in here so we'll keep it at two

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.720 
set that in here so we'll keep it at two
things<00:07:23.170> that's<00:07:23.320> the<00:07:23.380> one<00:07:23.530> reality<00:07:23.650> and<00:07:24.070> if<00:07:24.610> we

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:24.730 
things that's the one reality and if we

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.720 
things that's the one reality and if we
just<00:07:24.880> save<00:07:25.150> that<00:07:25.180> now<00:07:25.660> and<00:07:26.290> then<00:07:26.710> if<00:07:26.860> we<00:07:27.040> update

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 
just save that now and then if we update

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:33.680
