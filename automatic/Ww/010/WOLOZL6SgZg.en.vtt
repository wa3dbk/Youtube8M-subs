all right everybody if I'm about to

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.440 
all right everybody if I'm about to
death<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.830> today<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.160> wanted<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> show

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650 
death here and today I wanted to show
you<00:00:09.480> guys<00:00:09.720> a<00:00:10.880> well<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.910> can't<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.480> call<00:00:12.600> it

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you guys a well I can't really call it

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
you guys a well I can't really call it
my<00:00:12.900> invention<00:00:13.500> solely<00:00:13.800> because<00:00:14.210> I'm

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
my invention solely because I'm

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.810 
my invention solely because I'm
guaranteed<00:00:16.680> someone<00:00:17.160> has<00:00:17.280> done<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.610> before

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
guaranteed someone has done this before

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.680 
guaranteed someone has done this before
but<00:00:18.530> for<00:00:19.530> whatever<00:00:19.710> reason<00:00:19.950> a<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.330> people

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
but for whatever reason a lot of people

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.109 
but for whatever reason a lot of people
don't<00:00:21.780> know<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.110> this<00:00:22.410> design<00:00:22.940> so<00:00:23.940> while

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
don't know about this design so while

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.840 
don't know about this design so while
this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.930> cobblestone<00:00:25.440> generator<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.520> I

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
this is a cobblestone generator that I

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.070 
this is a cobblestone generator that I
use<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:28.500> sky<00:00:28.800> block<00:00:29.070> world<00:00:29.480> which<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.869> will

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
use in my sky block world which I will

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
use in my sky block world which I will
be<00:00:31.199> doing<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.560> series<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.219> sky<00:00:32.730> block<00:00:32.999> in<00:00:33.239> my

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
be doing a series on sky block in my

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.090 
be doing a series on sky block in my
channel<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.019> shortly<00:00:34.739> sometime<00:00:35.429> soon<00:00:36.140> but<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
channel here shortly sometime soon but a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.579 
channel here shortly sometime soon but a
lot<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.789> people<00:00:39.089> always<00:00:39.359> do<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> traditional

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
lot of people always do the traditional

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.599 
lot of people always do the traditional
generator<00:00:41.039> light<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> gonna

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
generator light and then this is gonna

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:58.029 
generator light and then this is gonna
catch<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.149> little<00:00:45.389> fire<00:00:45.659> Manila<00:00:48.949> like<00:00:49.949> this

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.750 

right<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.339> that's<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.449> cobblestone<00:01:00.780> generator

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
right and that's a cobblestone generator

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.740 
right and that's a cobblestone generator
but<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.440> very<00:01:04.649> efficient<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.750> now

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but it's not a very efficient one now

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.149 
but it's not a very efficient one now
you<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.039> beginning

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you do have to do that at the beginning

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
you do have to do that at the beginning
a<00:01:08.430> sky<00:01:08.640> block<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.360> once<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.110> some

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
a sky block but once you get some

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.270 
a sky block but once you get some
cobblestone<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.350> expand<00:01:14.039> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
cobblestone from it and you expand and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.120 
cobblestone from it and you expand and
have<00:01:14.399> more<00:01:14.610> space<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:16.950> be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have more space and all that you will be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.209 
have more space and all that you will be
able<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.180> bigger<00:01:18.719> generator<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.469> now

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
able to make a bigger generator and now

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:21.980 
able to make a bigger generator and now
this<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.609> especially<00:01:20.969> for<00:01:21.299> multiplayer<00:01:21.780> if

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this is especially for multiplayer if

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
this is especially for multiplayer if
you<00:01:22.109> have<00:01:22.229> more<00:01:22.439> than<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.799> person<00:01:23.219> if<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
you have more than one person if not you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.539 
you have more than one person if not you
would<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.289> cut<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.189> this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
would just kind of cut this this this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.270 
would just kind of cut this this this
and<00:01:26.789> this<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> let's<00:01:28.439> show<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.829> or

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and this out so let's show you out or

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.830 
and this out so let's show you out or
let's<00:01:29.670> show<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> how<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.179> build<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> case

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
let's show you how to build it in case

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.349 
let's show you how to build it in case
that<00:01:31.109> isn't<00:01:31.289> simple<00:01:31.710> enough<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.880> right

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
that isn't simple enough all right

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.419 
that isn't simple enough all right
first<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.020> you're<00:01:34.109> gonna<00:01:34.229> wanna<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.619> go<00:01:35.039> 3

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
first what you're gonna wanna do is go 3

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.999 
first what you're gonna wanna do is go 3
up<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.829> 3<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:40.009> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
up right here and right here go 3 up to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.139 
up right here and right here go 3 up to
get<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:43.310> break<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.609> gotta<00:01:45.030> make

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
get right here and break you gotta make

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.359 
get right here and break you gotta make
a<00:01:45.210> flush<00:01:45.630> with<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.049> center<00:01:46.320> hoe<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> out

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.149 

alright<00:01:50.869> then<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> exact<00:01:52.710> same<00:01:52.740> thing

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
alright then do the exact same thing

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:02.420 
alright then do the exact same thing
right<00:01:53.340> here

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.580 

all<00:02:03.430> right<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:04.750> that's<00:02:05.049> your<00:02:05.170> basic

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
all right and then that's your basic

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.230 
all right and then that's your basic
generator<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.220> one<00:02:06.340> person<00:02:06.760> now<00:02:06.850> what<00:02:07.030> you'll

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
generator for one person now what you'll

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.690 
generator for one person now what you'll
do<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.750> you're<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.530> put<00:02:08.890> water<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.550> one

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
do is you're going to put water on one

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.880 
do is you're going to put water on one
side<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.270> then<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.050> side<00:02:11.319> you're<00:02:11.560> gonna<00:02:11.620> put

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
side and then the side you're gonna put

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.150 
side and then the side you're gonna put
lava<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.880> actually<00:02:13.240> need<00:02:13.420> one<00:02:14.160> space

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
lava in you actually need one space

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.280 
lava in you actually need one space
shorter<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.260> you're<00:02:18.010> gonna<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.290> put

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
shorter and you're gonna go down and put

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
shorter and you're gonna go down and put
wob<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:21.330> let<00:02:22.330> me<00:02:22.420> exit<00:02:22.780> creative<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.470> show

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
wob in it let me exit creative and show

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.000 
wob in it let me exit creative and show
you<00:02:24.370> how<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.819> works<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> reason<00:02:26.890> why<00:02:26.980> you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
you how it works so the reason why you

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
you how it works so the reason why you
put<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.340> one<00:02:27.670> extra<00:02:27.910> one<00:02:28.239> there<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
put that one extra one there so that you

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.479 
put that one extra one there so that you
don't<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.380> aim<00:02:29.500> down<00:02:29.709> here<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.400> aim

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
don't have to aim down here you can aim

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.740 
don't have to aim down here you can aim
at<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.790> block<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.989> stay<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.320> close<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
at this block you just stay in close and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.930 
this one is like I said multiplayer you
can<00:02:55.239> just<00:02:55.420> add<00:02:55.600> another<00:02:55.900> one<00:02:56.080> right<00:02:56.260> there<00:02:56.290> so

on this one you would put it on this
side<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.590> then<00:02:59.709> two<00:02:59.950> people<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.519> go<00:03:00.610> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
side and then two people can go to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640 
side and then two people can go to
simultaneously<00:03:01.510> using<00:03:01.720> one<00:03:02.110> thing<00:03:02.319> of<00:03:02.440> lava
