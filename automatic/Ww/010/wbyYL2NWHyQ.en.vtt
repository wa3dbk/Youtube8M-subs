 belt 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.439
 down below r 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.759
 besides reflecting

 efe 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.659
 In the area 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.240
 yesterday the state in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez the day hello 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.950
 ap 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
 in the rest 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.410
 good 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.750
 be superman the first day approached him was 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.040
 really incredible to know that in the five months that were made of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.120
 preproduction were behind i 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.230
 finally we would put in film 80 in this case 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.580
 my first time as a superman was very powerful 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.230
 not only for me but for many people sometimes 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.970
 there was a great energy 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.690
 the first scene that simmons is no longer in the movie was common the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.090
 workers of the day of the planet and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.630
 none realize that the superman is behind them all are 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.740
 watching the television monitors and the people could not watch what was not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.790
 allowed them to turn around because no photograph of the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.080
 suit 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.440
 everyone was very worried because they will not elope, they all tried 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 to get to hide and seek was a great day for all I think 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.229
 but it was great finally 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 interpret the character 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.109
 in the film 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.530
 because it's got a lot of history has a lot of legacy is a great 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.020
 opportunity to mine and I'm proud to have had the opportunity to be able 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.850
 interpret this character is to continue his journey what we have seen 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.619
 for the last 70 years 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.779
 It was something 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.239
 impulsive schmunk for me 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.769
 michele merlo august 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.769
 zacarÃ­as civil war now the truth 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.269
 yes 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.860
 operators the question is for carlos motor vehicles 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.840
 well the association known as and with that universe of subjects 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.649
 how they feel about that 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.980
 down pace 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.100
 I realized that I discovered I understood 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:07.049
 icons ago av I think it's amazing 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.170
 in my first film interpreter will be an icon 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.729
 I'm very proud of it, I feel very honored especially because 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.549
 it's an icon and with a very big story 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.469
 an amazing number of actors artists and writers have given life to 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.819
 this character and now I am part of it 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.179
 it's great it's a great icons too good I guess all the icons are 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.899
 good and 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 this really does not make sense but 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.430
 and what is amazing there I am very happy to continue this tradition 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:51.549
 ladis tower of the character and present it to new people children around the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.359
 world must see character and they will be inspired by the spirit of 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.959
 Superman 6 is a great honor and I am very proud 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.789
 I am also very excited govern 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.319
 interpret something as important as the design 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.789
 I think what I also find interesting 10 percent in this 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.800
 movie saturday but it shows incredibly related beyond the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.389
 public can observe 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.389
 I think we all interpret it this way 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.309
 they are characters 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:41.859
 although the public can see between jones and with them but also understand and 

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:43.479
 get lost with them 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.169
 I feel that that is the contribution of payens home way of making movies 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.059
 I'm just happy to put the like back on the icon 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.559
 the bernabÃ©u to welcome Gaddafi 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.559
 a pate 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.029
 Two decades 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:12.490
 like buenos aires 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.580
 Andrew 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.029
 to work 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.029
 this from the city 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:21.800
 on the rocks 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.330
 it's true it was an extremely difficult decision for me because 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.229
 almost six years in the universe of men x 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.199
 I'm very proud of the first two parts is job lie they say 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.360
 them my relationship with the actors with my collaborators what happened was 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.059
 that I grew up being a big fan of his weapons since he was a child with the series 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:41.560
 condition of Swiss chubut 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.500
 and the Richard Donner movie in 1978 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.890
 I am adopted economically so I identify myself I have always felt very 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.520
 related to the character probably superman and what I write 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.760
 I think I know his childhood so if it were not for my love for his brothers the 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.360
 fact that richard donner proved that he can be a cartoon character 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.330
 that had already been relegated to cereals on television and tomic made of 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.400
 transport him to an epic movie I would not have known how to make the 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.300
 men's luggage movies so the idea for this movie started 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.110
 with the notion of not making a film that Richard Donner's film if not 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.659
 a return story 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.929
 where was that not the important thing to me if not the one that returns a planet 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:24.999
 land that has advanced and that relationships have also done 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:29.039
 I presented this idea in a hotel room in Austin Texas will have done 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.880
 detonar whose wife provoked the x-men tapes 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.490
 I saw it in grants 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.940
 and Richard Donner thought it was really a good idea and for me it was 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.029
 how to contain your blessing 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.129
 his enthusiasm itself feel that if one day he could make the film that 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.099
 would do 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.680
 warner brothers had developed a history of 

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:48.779
 origin 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.039
 of the origin of superman that involved three directors 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.879
 like 9 different international 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:59.499
 actors as a partner and it was very difficult to make him separate from that idea 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:07.079
 but exactly two years ago on July 4 I presented this idea that 

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.489
 I was working with so many normal my writer partner 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:16.609
 I made the present to the studio looks told them that I want to make this movie 

00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:20.929
 I want to do this and I want to do it now it's a return story is 

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:24.740
 completely different it took me about 45 minutes to explain the story the 

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:29.239
 heads of the study the turpentine rovers and in the more than 72 hours we already had a 

00:07:29.239 --> 00:07:32.879
 I try to make the film and it was very difficult for me because I knew that 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:35.080
 Men x would advance if min 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.870
 but as I said before if there was not a superman my love for superman for the 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.510
 character there was no exam because pan herman with jobs with none of this 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.840
 and I had not known how they are exhibited together 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.470
 so for me it feels like they are not a great opportunity but as a 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.699
 responsibility 

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.699
 it's because he has not cast in a long time 

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:58.460
 this Saturday to Qatar 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.779
 Reserve 

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:03.779
 4 

00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:09.939
 the port of acapulco 

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:11.739
 I had recently passed
