00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.830
 another product presentation of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 global phishing 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.670
 we would like to give you the new fox today 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.740
 imagine the finger and the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 successor of yes you can say 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 I have myself legendary mk2 singer 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.920
 fished over many years and that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 this is now the mk 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 3 yes what is different i have the or 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.380
 can do the comparison quite well 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 because as I said in m place high 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
 I've been researching for many years 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.630
 different mechanism of it something 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.340
 but it has become lighter anyway 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.240
 not too easy for him to be alone 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.790
 can adjust 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.440
 the basic mechanism as such is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.120
 certainly the most known of the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.739
 zwinger hangs here as among your up 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 indicator the cord in passing thereby 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.610
 when the fish is heading for land 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 it says weight down here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.329
 the cord runs through the bite indicator 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 and the warning beep sounds otherwise 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.039
 I find here at the mk3 that was too 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 even with the mk second case this 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.059
 mechanism here comes very well the part 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 between the stick and yours up 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.230
 then you can display the kennel 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 Just click and if it is the whole 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 it is pushed underneath it 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 the kennel disappears here in the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.570
 great presentation spox the greens too 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 is there and well protected yes 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.880
 what has changed from mk2 to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.049
 mp3 and it is a very significant one 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.080
 improvement as I think the mk 2 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 had a front here just came a beta 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.259
 light or a kink light purely so that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 Illuminated all night again 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.659
 and you can see that from the bar better 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 could 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.979
 these subjects are often quite happy 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.479
 disappeared because the mechanism is right 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.220
 they were easy then they are 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 fell off and when does that have fox 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 now replaced by a silicone 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.590
 Closure here in the lower area too 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 very good on one side 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.530
 So it is not clear that one opens and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.240
 but must keep in hand 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.799
 It is fixed and there fit like 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.479
 said a kink light purely or supplier 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.130
 sorry for yes and then lit too 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.710
 beautiful in the color now here in the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.750
 case a so called traffic light set in the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.790
 color form too hot explains itself 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.040
 and what I am also very teasingly at 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.180
 the fox mk3 stringer is the logo 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.759
 what worked here again purely 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 So all in all a great thing 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.659
 a good product even when you are 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.850
 now in the cashier area is on the way 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.149
 must-have in any case yes 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.770
 fox mk3 stringer from now on global 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.850
 phishing is looking at you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.850
 have fun with it
