thing is probably going to cause him a
lot<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.899> problems<00:01:50.289> because<00:01:50.829> back<00:01:51.130> into<00:01:51.310> her

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
lot of problems because back into her

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.399 
lot of problems because back into her
before<00:01:51.789> his<00:01:51.939> death<00:01:52.149> water<00:01:52.509> go<00:01:53.229> for<00:01:53.380> the

obvious sidekick because I'm not really
going<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.360> over<00:01:55.570> predict<00:01:56.020> here<00:01:56.939> I've<00:01:57.939> already

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
going to over predict here I've already

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.270 
going to over predict here I've already
seen<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:58.630> oh<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.320> two<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.619> his<00:01:59.680> you<00:01:59.860> use<00:02:00.100> so

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.649 
seen as oh you and two of his you use so
now<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.430> just<00:02:00.520> have<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.789> worry<00:02:00.969> about<00:02:01.119> his<00:02:01.420> um

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
now I just have to worry about his um

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.050 
now I just have to worry about his um
yeah<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.380> going<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.619> jolteon<00:02:03.039> as<00:02:03.250> he<00:02:03.939> goes

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
yeah so I going to jolteon as he goes

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.279 
yeah so I going to jolteon as he goes
for<00:02:04.180> him<00:02:04.299> by<00:02:04.390> our<00:02:04.479> electric<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.869> figured<00:02:05.170> he<00:02:05.259> had

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
for him by our electric I figured he had

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.719 
for him by our electric I figured he had
that<00:02:05.590> like<00:02:05.770> why<00:02:05.920> else<00:02:06.100> would<00:02:06.250> he<00:02:06.280> send<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.579> in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
that like why else would he send it in

know<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.760> priority<00:02:18.760> move<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:19.090> man<00:02:19.299> did<00:02:19.329> match

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
know a priority move like man did match

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.199 
know a priority move like man did match
pond<00:02:19.930> change<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.650> ends<00:02:21.220> up<00:02:21.280> being<00:02:21.340> fake

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
pond change that that ends up being fake

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.830 
pond change that that ends up being fake
out<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.989> yeah<00:02:23.880> not<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:24.910> big<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.390> deal<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.780> do

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
out so yeah not that big of a deal I do

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.569 
out so yeah not that big of a deal I do
sort<00:02:26.109> of<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.290> toxic<00:02:26.859> going<00:02:27.130> for<00:02:27.250> earthquake

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
sort of a toxic going for earthquake

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.670 
sort of a toxic going for earthquake
probably<00:02:27.940> would<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.090> been<00:02:28.209> smarter<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.470> at

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
probably would have been smarter but at

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.190 
probably would have been smarter but at
least<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:30.070> lets<00:02:30.280> me<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.850> know

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
goes back into old fart probably

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.160 
goes back into old fart probably
