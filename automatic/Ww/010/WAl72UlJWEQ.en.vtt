00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.210
 2 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.030
 hello to all and welcome to this live 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.520
 today we are going to talk about a product that pleases well who is theirs the tops 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.959
 walk and that's because the method is challenged because 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.519
 fortunately this moment and yet there is still a pretty strong demand for the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.409
 audience share 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.369
 this one in addition to this very very interesting for two reasons first 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.709
 he is really happy to see him and then he embarks the new 

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:27.239
 amd processor range so the mdj you have 4 300 his troop he should 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.029
 be possible to find it soon also in queen of the pocket of 155 should 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 not change much thing they say performance products so this is the zotac zbox 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 nano plus both versions plus version and silk that is delivered automatically 

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.820
 with two gigabytes of memory and 320 gb of storage 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.350
 so this one is ready at the beginning functions and cards suffer from a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.320
 open inquiry the system of your choice 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.100
 the version 5 of boxing nano without nothing it will be the worker is not very and not 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 very complicated it must be opened and therefore use ddr3 memory 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.860
 to start with something 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.730
 it's a little gear that is very very interesting for a lot of reasons 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.510
 but first because she says m 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.110
 really very compact 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 so soaking not have something very complete but as you can 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.600
 to see it is a machine that will take up very little space on a 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.210
 office 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.940
 it's really something you 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.080
 very very discreet very compact and which in addition comes with a system that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.970
 liked it the hang it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.780
 on the back of a screen to give you an idea of ​​its size 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 so that's 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.860
 pocket bocaly infolio 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.000
 that's what it can give compared to the state thinks we have 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.070
 really a machine that is more outdated in a world of retail 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.960
 congestion 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.479
 very very very indiscreet notice 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.749
 the compactness I think that planned the interior component supplier this 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:44.360
 machine 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.039
 we can hardly do better 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.669
 So that's interesting for a lot of people who are looking for 

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:51.460
 discreetly solutions easy integrated solutions 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.350
 we do not get too bad the very complete product we will make the debate is all 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.940
 right now 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.190
 of politics in particular 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.450
 to break the line is well seen so we start with the back side 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.720
 if we have a connection is very very complete on this back side 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.380
 first a port at the abbey mentation we liked a power supply is very 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.980
 standard the five power supplies says portas so zero noise nuisance 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.459
 a little letter from the ofsp to check that it works well it's 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.310
 polar tri 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.980
 chris angled series of cables season marcel very standard but it 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 works well the cable they could live with 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.779
 it's more than a good solution 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.540
 then a displayport port and he went out with friends and that means what for 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:31.829
 fly two screens 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.080
 With this machine to spare a screen display port directly 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.180
 a hdmi output for a TV our two mixed screens in all 5 the the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 processor in 1 er dan Carter who are working 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.100
 integrate this will be very very well managed screen ticket so it's more 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.100
 that a positive solution then choice on the see well yes 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.090
 two usb ports bolesteix here these two usb ports 3 0 so we have two ports 3 0 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.859
 from a quote point of view it's pretty good 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.209
 a port to the question of mayotte a western and kigali two ports the sp2 so 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.789
 this time it's more than 12 earlier to connect mouse and so on keyboard 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:13.289
 an esata port is there the output of the bay the antenna wifi and therefore the entrance of the 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.629
 site and live with it is that we will be able to aim here as on the back 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.599
 boxes 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.869
 the country rollarounds says usual routers so this is a solution 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.239
 if you are in the streets if you have one and something that is very 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.239
 discreet his love of the little queen the little antenna that will come out 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.439
 opposite adam 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.079
 postfinance front panel headphone output a micro input a sdhc card reader 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.739
 but also he says to himself 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.760
 so that's pretty good for the future to add a sd card in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.730
 the water a little saucepan so stopped the activity difficulties in the button 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.969
 boot and if these little things in magnificent hand it's a receiver 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.680
 not shy since tackling finally understood that people who bought 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.399
 metopes 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.909
 and not necessarily in five years to do the accounting but also to make 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.859
 more things like 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.859
 piloted by 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.679
 for 100 e if the high alps very compact she also a very pretty 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.579
 who takes control of himself and who will thus allow to pilot a machine to 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.560
 distance look decisive 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 to play music these lands all that will be done without any problem 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.170
 there are usb ports which what to put good God laughs telly on the machine and 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.620
 we have a solution that again is very compact that can be 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.360
 turn into a TV set 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.200
 So here is 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.380
 that's pretty very good on the side a breakdown comes back the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.210
 fins across on the back a second profession I do not know if it's 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.439
 an air intake I think so and on the bottom we notice 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:42.229
 two autopsies ventilation and these small species of two points on the side 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.800
 at each side that is simply not exploiting 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.719
 vesa support 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.969
 to be able to hook up% stick the machine back to the screen 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.419
 again it's metal it's pretty solid it's pretty damn good 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.419
 it gives a solution that is really super compact 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.520
 with% with really% if we will test it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.669
 on the performance of the usual zacate one has a solution that no 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.909
 only compact it is rather rather aesthetically successful the 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.330
 cons more seduced remote control 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.650
 but Kiev should offer quite nice performance 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.699
 for this type of machine would have to renew a little the phenomenon 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.789
 we are happy with your question I finish quickly made the package 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.400
 an attack that left at least 36 civilians dead 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.479
 not frankly I'm planted also wanted to plant boxing in a piece of furniture 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.509
 you can only take out this dongle all this is in the basic package 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.790
 separates it's not options from this moment the basic package 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.340
 this is a great idea, that is to say that the hiding 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.380
 renting proposes the noise pose out these only expected from 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.229
 TVs 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.330
 and you will be able to drive all that without taking any goal cashed 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.220
 rossi a very good idea you're right 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.659
 it's the documentation to force the hand of china 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.819
 with a lot of image rather well done pilots 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.199
 and the height of luxury we have teams apart for TV in my misfortune 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.300
 it's good because telecoms are delivered 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.469
 quite often a little problem is that 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:07.299
 the team however the actors manipulations for the transport are afraid in 

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:10.029
 countries that are exploited because something that comes to press the 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:13.039
 relaxation and it's pretty well named to the emmys apart from this stop in 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.479
 which new at startup very easy to change so much and the screws 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.700
 who are there to fix so the the the support of a screen 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.310
 so this is a solution that is very very complete does it was stressful 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.000
 quickly to see the remote control scope full of questions 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.199
 cultural impose you change everything 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.199
 even the noise that will release the overall performance 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.169
 by default it's really a solution that is very complete 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.300
 killer whale 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.219
 who can serve a dump from the exit of the du machine two years 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.529
 from his voice just installed a system 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:49.399
 for 100 th and which in my opinion saw its compactness and seen that performance 

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.590
 released 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.210
 this solution should seduce a lot of people 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.819
 at the same time to simply create a small pointy point that appears 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.030
 vision of the morning that you already have in the version 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.190
 this box nano 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.500
 and to create a small post a small post is immediate under the steps you 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:08.060
 to break too much the head to the branches employed in television 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.820
 and you have one has both a video jukebox a machine that can also do 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.210
 of the game and who can read mp3 will celebrate quite discreetly 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.409
 the next time we are removed we will try to see a little bit what he has 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:20.059
 in the stomach 

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:22.939
 percent of the rituals that has good ideas again at zotac 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:25.059
 including this opportunity to run 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:28.899
 the machine very easily that one does not need to work this to open 

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:33.299
 in June bibi feet are also pretty thin dissonances that has ruined 

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:36.759
 then pulled the lower part because the state 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.550
 directly to angers central 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.369
 we'll see that next time see you soon
