00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
just so as you know I'm at the top of

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.190 
just so as you know I'm at the top of
the<00:06:04.460> world<00:06:04.610> I'm<00:06:05.360> not<00:06:05.539> sure<00:06:05.720> what<00:06:05.900> this<00:06:05.990> was

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
the world I'm not sure what this was

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.050 
the world I'm not sure what this was
where<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.710> was<00:06:06.919> supposed<00:06:07.190> to<00:06:07.250> go<00:06:07.340> but<00:06:07.850> I

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
where this was supposed to go but I

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.560 
where this was supposed to go but I
think<00:06:08.450> I<00:06:08.690> may<00:06:08.810> have<00:06:08.840> done<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.140> last<00:06:09.350> temple<00:06:09.830> as

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
think I may have done the last temple as

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.820 
think I may have done the last temple as
the<00:06:11.570> second<00:06:11.960> temple<00:06:12.140> because<00:06:12.410> I<00:06:12.500> entered

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
the second temple because I entered

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.029 
the second temple because I entered
right<00:06:13.100> down<00:06:13.250> there<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:14.380> then<00:06:15.380> I<00:06:15.410> climbed<00:06:15.800> up

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
right down there and then I climbed up

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.940 
right down there and then I climbed up
to<00:06:16.160> this<00:06:16.340> tower<00:06:16.669> so<00:06:17.150> I'm<00:06:17.270> guessing<00:06:17.830> yeah<00:06:18.830> the

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
to this tower so I'm guessing yeah the

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.469 
to this tower so I'm guessing yeah the
guy<00:06:19.100> said<00:06:19.340> there<00:06:19.520> are<00:06:19.610> three<00:06:19.880> temples<00:06:20.270> that

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
guy said there are three temples that

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.120 
guy said there are three temples that
was<00:06:20.600> one<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.930> them<00:06:21.100> down<00:06:22.100> there<00:06:22.750> this<00:06:23.750> is
