00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.750 
is um I love the book I thought the book
was<00:06:01.990> actually<00:06:02.560> something<00:06:02.800> that<00:06:03.010> a<00:06:03.220> lot<00:06:03.310> of<00:06:03.550> us

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
was actually something that a lot of us

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.970 
was actually something that a lot of us
could<00:06:03.970> wear<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.570> was<00:06:04.960> really<00:06:05.290> bright<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:05.800> fun

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
could wear it was really bright and fun

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.830 
could wear it was really bright and fun
and<00:06:06.160> definitely<00:06:06.490> summer<00:06:07.090> appropriate

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
and definitely summer appropriate

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.320 
and definitely summer appropriate
because<00:06:08.220> some<00:06:09.220> people<00:06:09.550> picked<00:06:09.760> bright<00:06:10.030> colors

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
because some people picked bright colors

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.200 
because some people picked bright colors
but<00:06:10.480> to<00:06:10.600> me<00:06:10.720> they<00:06:10.870> were<00:06:10.930> more<00:06:11.290> like<00:06:11.530> rainbowy

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
but to me they were more like rainbowy

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.570 
but to me they were more like rainbowy
like<00:06:13.210> mermaid<00:06:13.990> II<00:06:14.020> not<00:06:14.860> necessarily<00:06:15.280> like

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580
