00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
I feel like as they expand they couldn't

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.650 
I feel like as they expand they couldn't
absorb<00:03:54.040> whatever<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.549> put<00:03:54.760> them<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.630> I

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
absorb whatever you put them in so I

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.060 
absorb whatever you put them in so I
made<00:03:55.870> another<00:03:55.989> batch<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.380> green<00:03:56.739> tea<00:03:56.920> because

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
made another batch of green tea because

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.830 
made another batch of green tea because
we<00:03:57.370> need<00:03:57.519> this<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.790> be<00:03:57.910> warm<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.450> feel<00:03:58.600> like<00:03:58.750> when

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
we need this to be warm I feel like when

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.160 
we need this to be warm I feel like when
it's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
it's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.309 
it's
kind<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.650> absorbs<00:04:00.550> more<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.300> think<00:04:01.450> maybe<00:04:02.140> it

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
kind of absorbs more I think maybe it

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.229 
kind of absorbs more I think maybe it
doesn't<00:04:02.500> out<00:04:02.770> of<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.250> might<00:04:03.430> simply<00:04:03.910> do

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
doesn't out of that it might simply do

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.570 
doesn't out of that it might simply do
is<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.450> put<00:04:04.599> one<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.780> these<00:04:04.870> in<00:04:05.140> here<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:06.160> as<00:04:06.340> you

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
is to put one of these in here so as you

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.520 
is to put one of these in here so as you
can<00:04:06.700> see<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:07.060> kind<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.239> unraveling<00:04:08.020> and<00:04:08.319> kind

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
can see it's kind of unraveling and kind

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.949 
can see it's kind of unraveling and kind
of<00:04:08.620> absorbing<00:04:09.160> all<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.610> green<00:04:10.209> tea<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:10.810> we're

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
of absorbing all the green tea so we're

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.400 
of absorbing all the green tea so we're
going<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.140> leave<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:11.470> ten<00:04:11.950> minutes<00:04:12.239> as

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
going to leave that for ten minutes as

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.319 
going to leave that for ten minutes as
