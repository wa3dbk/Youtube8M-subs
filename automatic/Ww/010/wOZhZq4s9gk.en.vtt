00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

the<00:00:44.730> last<00:00:44.850> video<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.899> adidas<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> see

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the last video from adidas that you see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
the last video from adidas that you see
but<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.700> guys<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.059> probably<00:00:48.149> already<00:00:48.570> seen

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
but you guys have probably already seen

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
but you guys have probably already seen
these<00:00:49.140> they're<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:49.739> simple<00:00:50.190> shoe<00:00:50.460> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
these they're a pretty simple shoe and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
these they're a pretty simple shoe and
that's<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.329> makes<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.750> great<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.199> my

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that's what makes them great in my

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
that's what makes them great in my
opinion<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.160> rather<00:00:53.370> than<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> whole

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
opinion so rather than do a whole

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
opinion so rather than do a whole
overview<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> incorporate

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.820 
if you're trying to track down a pair
I'd<00:02:47.209> recommend<00:02:47.780> checking<00:02:47.870> out<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.500> champ

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
I'd recommend checking out the champ

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.100 
I'd recommend checking out the champ
sports<00:02:49.220> website<00:02:49.790> they<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> bunch<00:02:50.900> of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
sports website they have a bunch of

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.140 
sports website they have a bunch of
other<00:02:51.350> colorways<00:02:51.800> available<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.790> there<00:02:52.970> right

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
other colorways available on there right

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.620 
other colorways available on there right
now

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
now

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.449 
now
like<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.989> all-black<00:02:54.440> pair<00:02:54.830> that's<00:02:55.100> really

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
like the all-black pair that's really

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.250 
like the all-black pair that's really
tough<00:02:55.670> I'll<00:02:55.940> probably<00:02:56.390> pick<00:02:56.630> those<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:57.080> at

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
tough I'll probably pick those up at

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.280 
tough I'll probably pick those up at
some<00:02:57.830> point<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.400> far<00:02:58.819> as<00:02:58.970> sizing<00:02:59.480> goes<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.959> my

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
some point as far as sizing goes in my

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.559 
some point as far as sizing goes in my
opinion<00:03:00.739> they<00:03:00.860> run<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.100> little<00:03:01.580> bit<00:03:01.760> big<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
opinion they run a little bit big so you

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.449 
opinion they run a little bit big so you
might<00:03:02.989> want<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> go<00:03:03.440> down<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.770> half<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.250> size

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
might want to go down a half a size

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.820 
might want to go down a half a size
unless<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.390> wide<00:03:05.660> foot<00:03:05.690> but<00:03:06.530> still

unless you have a wide foot but still

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.920 
unless you have a wide foot but still
your<00:03:07.010> best<00:03:07.190> option<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.970> try<00:03:08.239> them<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.600> in

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
your best option is to try them on in

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.199 
your best option is to try them on in
store<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.610> that's<00:03:10.820> going<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.030> wrap
