00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.909
 the four most common mistakes 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.909
 make squats 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.179
 weirdly welcome 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
 I 'll say four times about the new videos 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.740
 frequent mistakes in the squats 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.690
 the spots and we celebrate the same 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.020
 also on and it was the first mistake 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.439
 is 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.640
 you take a standardized one 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.289
 Shoulder width was yes that if at 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 me about so I guess but 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 some people do not have to do that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 stand wide or have to go further 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.420
 stand or stand even closer between 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 make it so far and that makes so great 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 squats 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.050
 but I, for example , only stand so far 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.870
 with now so Sobotta still so good 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.200
 So do not squat 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.910
 very sure what that's what 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.469
 People ask you what we do for the state 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.559
 has to do but takes the best 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.539
 the stand with the po with the hip on 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.399
 farthest after and so I get 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 got it for me these are these 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 originating bankrupt best for me it is 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.879
 yes already showed and so I can 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.250
 nice to go down so far and so that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.500
 one only just keeps happiness and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.260
 this and seeks you even this position 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 It's best to choose where you're best from 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.229
 will be the lowest accommodation in cleaner 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.229
 technology of course who is number two 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.770
 at the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.909
 Error number two is not the knee 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.619
 really long toes, it is also 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.240
 even that the cologne for example 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.220
 has often addressed but that the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.020
 Most prefers to say in this video 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.360
 It just always comes down to it 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.390
 length of pure from the thigh and am 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.920
 lower leg to how far the knee after 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.130
 forwardly this I declare whatsoever 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.080
 Pretty good in the studio so for example 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.090
 people say yes, the criticism I will 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.670
 foot tips I 'll show now 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.440
 Change me if I have his here now 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.619
 FuÃŸstitzen I go now always on 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.979
 sunniest down then I'm a lot 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.500
 more unstable to shop but completely 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630
 why I have my knee so lieske 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.649
 I would have last time for protection 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 and grant and there is a lot 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.709
 harder is the meaning behind it 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.810
 or something to think about 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.290
 Advises him about who wants the tips of his toes 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.480
 namely, if I had long legs 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.519
 I for example because we just have 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.900
 get over the tips of your foot one 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.910
 The legs were tidy 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.799
 that can not be trained too much 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 the rides go if I define 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.850
 if it is over the tips of the toes 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 also a lot of white buildings and buildings 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.720
 way too far back too much so that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.209
 definitely a common mistake 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.040
 that many Germans always think that is 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.730
 So an error is error number three 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.049
 is that one has the wrong footwear 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.220
 I have a rail here now 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.230
 then I'll see you are wearing 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.299
 still no squats but it is 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.680
 no matter 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.100
 The wrong footwear is called now 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.690
 nike free sun or or or none 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.160
 Imagine any other sport plays 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.410
 he almost has a thick sole yes 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.540
 I also declare some good study are 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.910
 Now in the schoolhouse I always say 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.850
 and then now around again so and 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.680
 pushes it right one and then I say 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.030
 you 're actually actually as 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.770
 legally they do without us 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.500
 squat and say too much better 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.520
 for me much safer much more stable 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.170
 this is definitely a more common one 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.000
 error if the weightlifter has school 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.880
 Of course, how can you use them? 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.420
 but I say barefoot or with her 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.740
 socks 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.730
 she has definitely got it right 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.220
 firm stand and mistake number four is 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.420
 the one upper body forgets that 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.370
 game focuses only on the 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.230
 legs that in a really nice 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.819
 figurine made but he brings me the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.450
 Of course, that's just what it should be 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.190
 also clear 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.860
 try again the pole in the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.340
 handles visited outwards and upwards to 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.050
 so we push around here the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.959
 any upper rhythm of the tour 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:01.010
 quasi activated with decency share 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.420
 larger is actually activated the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.670
 lower back you have to work 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.290
 then on the back with tense if it 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.250
 his even more exercise and accurate 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.380
 they just better on the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.890
 train countless because then in the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.930
 turned lower back turned out to be the best 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.970
 and the lower back make it easier 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.560
 maximum muscle contraction if he has the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.350
 upper with decency as I do yes 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.940
 synonymous again extra video to no 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.410
 little tip of me only when the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.190
 they have to stand up out of it 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.870
 to press 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.289
 really nice to the upper back too 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.669
 save and then go down ok - that 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.200
 Now four needed the mistakes 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.950
 my knee bend i hope this video 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.539
 she liked 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.010
 and if you can celebrate on 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.090
 subscribe to the channel and me anyway 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.890
 make it easier 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.120
 and i would say see you im 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.620
