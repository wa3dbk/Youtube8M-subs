is<00:00:44.040> clearly<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.700> problem<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.600> why<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:47.039> look

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
is clearly a problem but why if you look

the way some glasses do this is they

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.630 
the way some glasses do this is they
place<00:02:28.780> light<00:02:29.170> absorbing<00:02:29.769> particles<00:02:30.310> either

last but not least your sunglasses need

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.009 
last but not least your sunglasses need
to<00:02:59.109> have<00:02:59.370> 100%<00:03:00.370> UV<00:03:00.760> protection<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.870> is

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
to have 100% UV protection this is

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.500 
to have 100% UV protection this is
because<00:03:02.350> without<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:03.250> your<00:03:03.820> sunglasses<00:03:04.299> are

because without this your sunglasses are
actually<00:03:04.870> going<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.170> damage<00:03:05.470> your<00:03:05.620> eyes<00:03:05.950> but

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
actually going to damage your eyes but

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.599 
actually going to damage your eyes but
why<00:03:07.120> well<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.440> reason<00:03:08.799> is<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.220> tint<00:03:09.489> you

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
why well the reason is the tint you

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.160 
why well the reason is the tint you
place<00:03:09.850> on<00:03:10.000> your<00:03:10.120> sunglasses<00:03:10.540> which<00:03:10.930> makes

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
place on your sunglasses which makes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.380 
place on your sunglasses which makes
them<00:03:11.350> darker<00:03:11.799> for<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.130> also<00:03:12.400> causes<00:03:13.269> your

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
them darker for you also causes your

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.289 
them darker for you also causes your
pupils<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.019> dilate<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.640> allows<00:03:16.000> more

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
pupils to dilate and this allows more

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.539 
pupils to dilate and this allows more
harmful<00:03:16.750> UV<00:03:17.260> rays<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.799> enter<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.250> back<00:03:18.400> of

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
harmful UV rays to enter the back of

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.430 
harmful UV rays to enter the back of
your<00:03:18.700> eye<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.060> cause<00:03:19.269> damage<00:03:19.600> but<00:03:20.260> let's

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
your eye and cause damage but let's

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.380 
your eye and cause damage but let's
think<00:03:20.709> about<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.310> astronauts<00:03:21.880> who<00:03:22.120> don't

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
think about the astronauts who don't

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.930 
think about the astronauts who don't
have<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.840> protective<00:03:23.230> layer<00:03:23.410> for<00:03:24.250> them<00:03:24.459> my

have this protective layer for them my

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.400 
have this protective layer for them my
protection<00:03:25.359> is<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:25.750> gold<00:03:26.019> dust

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
protection is like gold dust

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.979 
protection is like gold dust
and<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.650> mean<00:03:26.859> literally<00:03:27.310> gold<00:03:27.940> off<00:03:28.180> because<00:03:28.720> on

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
and I mean literally gold off because on

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.509 
and I mean literally gold off because on
their<00:03:29.109> visors<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.829> their<00:03:30.220> sunglasses

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
there's a thin layer of gold which

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.039 
there's a thin layer of gold which
as<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:34.069> barrier<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.760> block<00:03:35.239> away<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.629> harmful
