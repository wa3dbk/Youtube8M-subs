00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
bugger out of so if we're using echo we

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.820 
bugger out of so if we're using echo we
can<00:01:47.060> make<00:01:47.180> yucca<00:01:47.420> plug<00:01:47.720> these<00:01:48.290> plugs<00:01:48.650> are

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
can make yucca plug these plugs are

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.240 
can make yucca plug these plugs are
replaceable<00:01:49.750> interchangeable<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:52.009> as

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
replaceable interchangeable so we can as

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.980 
replaceable interchangeable so we can as
they<00:01:52.520> wear<00:01:52.729> out<00:01:52.940> we<00:01:53.149> can<00:01:53.300> replace<00:01:53.630> them<00:01:53.810> as

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
they wear out we can replace them as

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.560 
they wear out we can replace them as
this<00:01:54.200> top<00:01:54.470> wears<00:01:54.710> out<00:01:54.950> we<00:01:55.100> can<00:01:55.220> replace<00:01:55.520> it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
this top wears out we can replace it

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
this top wears out we can replace it
antler<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.600> another<00:01:56.960> good<00:01:57.170> thing<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.410> you

antler is another good thing that you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.469 
antler is another good thing that you
can<00:01:57.740> use<00:01:57.890> in<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.160> tops<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:59.030> think<00:01:59.270> maybe
