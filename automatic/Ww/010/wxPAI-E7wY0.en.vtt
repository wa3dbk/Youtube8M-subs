00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
you'll notice that it's not exactly

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.870 
you'll notice that it's not exactly
symmetrical<00:01:23.560> there's<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:23.860> little<00:01:24.009> tab<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:24.670> one

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
symmetrical there's a little tab on one

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.050 
symmetrical there's a little tab on one
side<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.509> that<00:01:26.079> tab<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.920> going<00:01:27.579> to<00:01:27.670> become

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
side and that tab is going to become

you're<00:01:28.630> gluing<00:01:29.140> strip<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.610> really<00:01:30.700> easy

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
you're gluing strip and it's really easy

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.389 
you're gluing strip and it's really easy
to<00:01:31.329> see<00:01:31.720> how<00:01:31.960> those<00:01:32.110> two<00:01:32.439> pieces<00:01:32.649> should<00:01:33.130> line

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
to see how those two pieces should line

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.020 
to see how those two pieces should line
up<00:01:33.430> because<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.659> wavy<00:01:34.960> edge<00:01:35.580> just<00:01:36.580> lines<00:01:36.820> up

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
up because the wavy edge just lines up

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
up because the wavy edge just lines up
perfectly<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.539> use<00:01:40.659> hot<00:01:41.020> glue<00:01:41.049> for

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
perfectly I like to use hot glue for

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.760 
perfectly I like to use hot glue for
this<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.399> just<00:01:43.390> use<00:01:43.689> this<00:01:43.929> bring<00:01:44.380> those<00:01:44.500> two

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
this and just use this bring those two

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.910 
this and just use this bring those two
pieces<00:01:45.189> together<00:01:49.259> maybe<00:01:50.259> put<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.709> bone

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
pieces together maybe put the bone

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.809 
pieces together maybe put the bone
folder<00:01:51.190> inside<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:53.890> make<00:01:54.159> sure<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.700> I'm

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
folder inside just to make sure that I'm

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.350 
folder inside just to make sure that I'm
getting<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.149> nice<00:01:55.330> flat<00:01:56.970> contact<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.179> those

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
getting a nice flat contact with those

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.820 
getting a nice flat contact with those
two<00:01:58.539> pieces<00:02:01.229> you'll<00:02:02.229> see<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.619> there<00:02:02.799> are

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
two pieces you'll see that there are

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.039 
two pieces you'll see that there are
five<00:02:03.220> tabs<00:02:03.670> on<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.090> bottom<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.630> teacup

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
five tabs on the bottom of the teacup

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.080 
five tabs on the bottom of the teacup
and<00:02:05.259> they<00:02:05.860> are<00:02:05.979> scored<00:02:06.549> so<00:02:06.819> they're<00:02:06.970> really

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
and they are scored so they're really

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.650 
and they are scored so they're really
easy<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.659> just<00:02:07.869> fold<00:02:08.140> right<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
easy to just fold right in like that and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.830 
easy to just fold right in like that and
then<00:02:13.660> you'll<00:02:13.840> take<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.470> smaller<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.430> two

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
then you'll take the smaller of the two

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.039 
then you'll take the smaller of the two
circles<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.680> die<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
circles that you get on this die and

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.349 
circles that you get on this die and
just<00:02:20.049> put<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.349> little<00:02:20.530> hot<00:02:20.830> glue<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:22.269> those<00:02:22.900> tabs

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
just put a little hot glue on those tabs

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:35.920 
just put a little hot glue on those tabs
and<00:02:25.359> then<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.019> position<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.799> dot

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.679 

and<00:02:36.049> then<00:02:36.650> there's<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.010> larger<00:02:37.670> dot<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.180> that

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
and then there's a larger dot and that

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:44.170 
and then there's a larger dot and that
will<00:02:38.870> go<00:02:39.019> on<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.409> inside<00:02:41.920> just<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.129> little<00:02:43.340> bit

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
will go on the inside just a little bit

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.620 
will go on the inside just a little bit
of<00:02:44.359> hot<00:02:44.599> glue<00:02:44.629> in<00:02:45.049> there<00:02:45.230> or<00:02:45.650> white<00:02:46.099> glue

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.870 

and<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:53.380> gives<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> really<00:02:54.390> nice<00:02:55.390> looking

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
and this gives you a really nice looking

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:06.710 
and this gives you a really nice looking
base<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.840> teacup

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.420 

next<00:03:07.720> we<00:03:07.900> will<00:03:08.050> do<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.319> base<00:03:08.500> piece<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.190> has

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
next we will do the base piece that has

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.390 
next we will do the base piece that has
tabs<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.090> also<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.910> you'll<00:03:13.180> hold<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:14.080> and

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
tabs on it also that you'll hold in and

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.220 
tabs on it also that you'll hold in and
I<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.730> geometric<00:03:16.480> side<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.050> paper

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
I like that geometric side of the paper

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.900 
I like that geometric side of the paper
to<00:03:17.590> show<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.280> will<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> outside<00:03:19.209> and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
to show so that will be the outside and

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.430 
to show so that will be the outside and
on<00:03:21.910> this<00:03:22.150> piece<00:03:22.390> also<00:03:22.660> there's<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.140> tab

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
on this piece also there's a tab

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.009 
on this piece also there's a tab
sticking<00:03:23.980> out<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.580> shows<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.209> exactly

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
sticking out and that shows you exactly

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.970 
sticking out and that shows you exactly
where<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:27.129> glue<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.930> I'm<00:03:32.080> applying<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.650> little

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
where to glue so I'm applying a little

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.690 
where to glue so I'm applying a little
bit<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.220> hot<00:03:33.400> glue<00:03:33.430> there<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.890> kind<00:03:36.640> of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
bit of hot glue there and just kind of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.699 
bit of hot glue there and just kind of
hold<00:03:36.849> on<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.269> for<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.630> few<00:03:37.780> minute<00:03:38.049> or<00:03:38.319> for

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
hold on to that for a few minute or for

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.020 
hold on to that for a few minute or for
a<00:03:38.739> few<00:03:38.890> seconds<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:40.349> that's<00:03:41.349> looking<00:03:41.739> good

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
a few seconds and that's looking good

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.170 
a few seconds and that's looking good
for<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.150> stage<00:03:44.549> instead<00:03:45.549> of<00:03:45.579> using<00:03:45.760> hot<00:03:46.150> glue

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
for this stage instead of using hot glue

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.170 
for this stage instead of using hot glue
on<00:03:46.540> these<00:03:46.720> tabs<00:03:47.049> I'm<00:03:47.470> using<00:03:48.190> white<00:03:48.549> glue<00:03:48.910> and

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
on these tabs I'm using white glue and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.940 
on these tabs I'm using white glue and
the<00:03:49.450> reason<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.319> use<00:03:50.470> white<00:03:50.739> glue

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
the reason that I like to use white glue

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.869 
the reason that I like to use white glue
is<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:52.030> when<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.690> set<00:03:53.230> my<00:03:53.650> teacup<00:03:54.280> into<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
is that when I set my teacup into the

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.380 
is that when I set my teacup into the
base<00:03:56.610> it'll<00:03:57.610> give<00:03:57.819> me<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.209> few<00:03:58.599> seconds<00:03:59.560> to<00:04:00.390> kind

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
base it'll give me a few seconds to kind

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.589 
base it'll give me a few seconds to kind
of<00:04:01.450> play<00:04:01.629> with<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.049> positioning<00:04:02.739> I'm<00:04:03.599> lining

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
of play with the positioning I'm lining

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.949 
of play with the positioning I'm lining
up<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.110> seams<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.480> teacup<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
up the seams of the teacup so that

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.440 
up the seams of the teacup so that
they're<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:09.280> same<00:04:09.609> place<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.180> see

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
they're in the same place you can see

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.930 
they're in the same place you can see
here<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.170> there<00:04:14.500> we've<00:04:15.100> got<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.579> in<00:04:15.790> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
here and there we've got that in the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.719 
here and there we've got that in the
same<00:04:16.120> place<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:17.100> then<00:04:18.100> I'm<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.519> pressing

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
same place and then I'm just pressing

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.260 
same place and then I'm just pressing
those<00:04:19.030> two<00:04:19.329> together<00:04:19.510> until<00:04:20.320> i'm<00:04:20.940> pretty<00:04:21.940> sure

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
those two together until i'm pretty sure

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.230 
those two together until i'm pretty sure
that<00:04:22.300> they<00:04:23.020> are<00:04:23.260> dry<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:27.580> can<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:27.940> down

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
that they are dry and you can get down

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.600 
that they are dry and you can get down
at<00:04:28.570> eye<00:04:28.960> level<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.620> see<00:04:30.460> if<00:04:30.760> your<00:04:31.539> cup<00:04:31.840> is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
at eye level and see if your cup is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.690 
at eye level and see if your cup is
looking<00:04:33.610> pretty<00:04:33.849> straight<00:04:37.680> next<00:04:38.680> step<00:04:38.979> is<00:04:39.220> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
looking pretty straight next step is the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.659 
looking pretty straight next step is the
handle<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.320> I'm<00:04:41.320> using<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.889> paintbrush<00:04:42.250> and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
handle and I'm using a paintbrush and

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.500 
handle and I'm using a paintbrush and
just<00:04:43.030> simply<00:04:44.160> rolling<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.340> handle<00:04:45.789> around<00:04:46.270> it

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
just simply rolling the handle around it

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.860 
just simply rolling the handle around it
until<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:47.590> get<00:04:47.830> about<00:04:47.950> halfway<00:04:48.570> down<00:04:49.570> that

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
until I get about halfway down that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.089 
until I get about halfway down that
strip<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.590> then<00:04:51.130> I'll<00:04:51.280> reverse<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:53.099> create

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
strip and then I'll reverse and create

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.370 
strip and then I'll reverse and create
kind<00:04:54.400> of<00:04:54.550> an<00:04:54.639> s-curve

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
kind of an s-curve

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.690 
kind of an s-curve
and<00:04:58.940> then<00:04:59.940> I'm<00:05:00.240> going<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:01.230> unroll<00:05:01.830> one

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
and then I'm going to just unroll one

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.320 
and then I'm going to just unroll one
side<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.420> s<00:05:03.690> curve<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.350> that<00:05:04.880> one<00:05:05.880> part<00:05:06.240> of

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
side of that s curve so that one part of

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.030 
side of that s curve so that one part of
it<00:05:06.420> is<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.600> little<00:05:06.840> bit<00:05:07.050> larger<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.770> way<00:05:07.890> it

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
it is a little bit larger the way it

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.980 
it is a little bit larger the way it
would<00:05:08.190> be<00:05:08.340> on<00:05:08.550> an<00:05:08.730> actual<00:05:09.260> teacup<00:05:10.260> handle<00:05:10.710> and

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
would be on an actual teacup handle and

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.810 
would be on an actual teacup handle and
then<00:05:12.990> I'm<00:05:13.230> going<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.740> use<00:05:13.860> some<00:05:13.890> hot<00:05:14.250> glue<00:05:14.490> and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
then I'm going to use some hot glue and

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.270 
then I'm going to use some hot glue and
apply<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.810> edge<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.530> has<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.950> seam

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
apply it to the edge that has the seam

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.700 
apply it to the edge that has the seam
on<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:17.670> just<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.450> help<00:05:18.690> hide<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.290> seem<00:05:19.680> a

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
on it just to help hide that seem a

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.110 
on it just to help hide that seem a
little<00:05:20.070> bit<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.890> couple<00:05:23.100> dabs<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.820> hot

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
little bit just a couple dabs of hot
