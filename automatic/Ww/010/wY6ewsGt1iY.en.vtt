00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.460
 you would almost think this renault 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.129
 clio dutch car is that he is 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.689
 designed by maurice van den akker and 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.480
 down here in the front 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.130
 are 90hp three-cylinder and that 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 represents a value of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.119
 thriftiness 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.119
 Dutch Who did we go see it 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.570
 new kilo that drives really well 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.010
 that engine that is now a three-cylinder engine 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.220
 very spicy you need a little bit 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.870
 making a round of revolutions and therefore he is diligent 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.790
 only the economy that I still 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.640
 claiming a bit of a problem with bruno 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.470
 one out of 11 on average but just because of me 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.320
 need your little bit of speed 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.420
 we do not get beyond a 14 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.410
 still very reasonable but still falls one to me 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.570
 bit against it 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.950
 furthermore he sends very sharp and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.320
 very direct 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.020
 really nice chassis is very beautiful 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.229
 balance so yes really not much 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.090
 criticism under property have the cleo 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.509
 may be a compact car from 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.120
 Outside 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.000
 inside it is surprisingly spacious 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.850
 in all areas of the world 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.590
 in the back also only the entry is on the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.270
 tight side 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.000
 but once she sits you have enough 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.860
 space for your head and your legs and 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.049
 all the way back 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.040
 there you will find a luggage space of 300 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.299
 liters 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.920
 if you need more then you can 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.450
 rear seat backrest in two uneven 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.770
 parts fold away 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.960
 And then you have this space for more than 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.330
 eleven hundred liters very practical 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.400
 car so in the rear doors 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.070
 rather narrow rider 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.479
 a child can therefore look outside 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.920
 furthermore it is backwards to the little one 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.880
 side and has turned to the rear 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.880
 therefore also less 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.080
 the dashboard looks well cared for 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.030
 all important controls throughout us 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.680
 sit comfortably within reach 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.970
 the heating knob is also good 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.410
 to serve 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.210
 very nice it is quite large 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.800
 screen that lets you include those 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.800
 navigation system 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.980
 this renault clio in the dynamics 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.840
 performance 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 look like the best he is furthermore 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.510
 fully equipped and it is nice and spacious 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.880
 I also have a problem inside 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.680
 frugality with diligence it is diligent 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.500
 engine only 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.060
 economical he is not nearly in the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800
 near the consumption that the factory 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 give up and that is actually quite 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.980
 Unfortunately
