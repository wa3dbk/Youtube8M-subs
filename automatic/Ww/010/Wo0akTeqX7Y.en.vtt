00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.149
 d 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.149
 and the next 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello I am lewis welcome to this game 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 is and well already spent almost three months 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.879
 three months since I uploaded my video from 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 the purposes of 2015 and well I think that 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.750
 it is very important to have as certain 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 constancy and some control in the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.630
 advances that are being made so that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.400
 when the end of this year arrives , 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.500
 have as a surprise about what 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.089
 you got over what I did not achieve then 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.279
 I feel it is important to have this 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.169
 some control and I'll try every three 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.000
 months of uploading an advance that maybe 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.010
 is going with my purposes so it's that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.810
 without further adding let's start one 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 of the first purposes that I set 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.100
 it was reading 30 books I think I'm going pretty 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.170
 well because I've already 6 of 30 then 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.090
 I think I'm doing pretty good 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 apart from that I have put a little 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.660
 more attention and also counting 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.340
 I have not had much time to read 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.629
 because I'm very good at this in 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.719
 Second, I decided to read a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.430
 audiobook and that's what I 'm reading 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.780
 insurgent in an ebook while I listen 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.370
 my audiobook the truth is that it's a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.559
 very father experience that I recommend 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 all we'll see in three months and managed 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.940
 fulfill it or not although surely this 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.010
 error will also be in third place 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 I decided to read Harry Potter and here I am 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 the lousy own I have to put the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.030
 batteries I hope that in this month or the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.190
 next 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 or at least a book by Harry Potter 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.760
 because it causes me to read three books and not 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 come none do I have to wear the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880
 I'm going to notice very well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.500
 so as not to lose sight of it 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.869
 in the fourth place I decided to read to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 stephen king and this achievement I finished it 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.520
 lakers and stephen king and soon 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020
 You will see my opinion on this book if you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.990
 Interested write me in the comments 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.850
 but at least I already have one of my 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
 achievements fulfilled the fifth place me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.869
 I proposed to finish my stephen collection 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.580
 king who has not finished it yet I think 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.320
 I still have many books I think 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.509
 that in the auction of books I'm going to look 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.500
 like crazy these books and if I do not I do not know 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.539
 What am I going to do? I think it's going to 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.789
 ask for internet in sixth place I 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.399
 I proposed reading albert espinosa 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.710
 this achievement is also complete I read the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.420
 world to several of thorny albert and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.250

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 I'll be talking about him on this channel in 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.009
 number 7 of I proposed to read 'the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840
 miserable 'I have to put the batteries 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.490
 with this I still do not even buy myself 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.170
 an edition of this book to read it 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.670
 I hope to get it also at the auction 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 of books because I'm a little behind 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 with this I also proposed uploading videos 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.040
 every Thursday at 10 pm during 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.130

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.020
 with the days but it has not failed 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.160
 very very well I have to throw more desire 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 so as not to fail you or another 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.400

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.530

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.050
 the year I what I will achieve 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.000
 because now I 'm going to do them as a 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.890
 video per page but I'm going to dedicate 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.170
 much more time to be worth the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.000
