 I already wanted to try the south daughter 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.400
 the answer is these bottles of land dry sauce 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.079
 soy sauce is very different from that 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.729
 the sauce that we sell in Russia 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.639
 very different thick saturated amounts 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.520
 Japanese oil butter is one 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.169
 of the most expensive products store 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.370
 not everyone can let a japanese 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.940
 butter so that's started about your 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.950
 sauce 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.139
 they have it thicker saturated us 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:46.440
 as watery as water 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.440
 have developed more more water on them 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.220
 so now there means pour out pouring 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.169
 There Bulgarian type pepper is similar to 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.700
 Bulgarian but growing in Japan too 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.070
 call with don't know how he will 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.650
 be called Bulgarian whether Japanese somehow 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.620
 called 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.870
 value k so disturbed by tiles 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.509
 the lights are burning these tiles are cosmic 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.180
 space electric tile 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:16.350
 that is, the night turns itself off 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.600
 when you need to read minds means u 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.699
 the hostess here she thought tile 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.120
 turn on it once turned on the tile 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.560
 tile off it turns off 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:32.070
 Japanese technology has stepped away 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:34.199
 forward this here joe besides all the japanese all 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.250
 the Japanese are surrounded by the Japanese are very cute 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:40.740
 very nice joyful people so apartments 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.880
 interfere so interfere over the order of types 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.130
 so we remember the process itself 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.850
 order order remember order 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.660
 fry 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.490
 here it is bookmarks order bookmarks 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.849
 dishes dishes it means why 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.860
 probably later 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.810
 maybe there and the vermicelli still throw out 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.000
 but I don't know exactly what we look like 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.000
 vermicelli or not will be seen later 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.880
 these japa bottom so sauce 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.639
 be sure to soy sauce on without it 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.020
 one dish is not made and and Japanese 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:24.479
 soy sauce required 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.479
 so prevented the guy fry 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.620
 he did not even have time to fry everything there 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:36.669
 vermicelli 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.910
 spilled out means you slept tops that is 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:42.170
 destroy 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:46.070
 In general, we increase everything in Japanese 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:49.130
 talking 7 at home jamo jamo jamo c on 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:53.300

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:56.480
 for you to find the best sushi in Sousse 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.580
 correctness all sushi su-7 wand it 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.800
 these mean food but they are bigger 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.750
 size it means kitchen sticks then 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.110
 there are enemies to interfere in the pan interfere 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.520
 big sized sticks on such all 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.290
 so near 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.570

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.300
 and let it all mean soar there 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.280
 steam steamed soar so more 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.070
 little sumus still wait a little bit 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:25.640
