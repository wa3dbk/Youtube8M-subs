00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
basically for a YouTube staff to read

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.320 
basically for a YouTube staff to read
and<00:00:30.400> decide<00:00:30.730> what<00:00:30.880> they're<00:00:31.000> going<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.150> do

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
and decide what they're going to do

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.320 
and decide what they're going to do
again<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.320> actual<00:00:33.100> terms<00:00:33.700> of<00:00:33.910> service<00:00:34.240> are

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330

pretty<00:00:34.570> weird<00:00:34.870> so<00:00:35.140> I<00:00:35.170> don't<00:00:35.350> know<00:00:35.410> what<00:00:35.530> the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
pretty weird so I don't know what the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.080 
pretty weird so I don't know what the
hell<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:35.920> going<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.100> happen<00:00:36.160> I<00:00:36.640> don't<00:00:36.670> even

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
think YouTube know something to do it's

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.000 
think YouTube know something to do it's
kind<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.460> weird<00:00:39.700> so<00:00:40.000> they<00:00:40.270> are<00:00:41.020> so<00:00:41.440> i<00:00:41.740> think<00:00:41.800> i'm

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
still waiting on that and it could be it

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.720 
still waiting on that and it could be it
could<00:00:44.170> be<00:00:44.380> this<00:00:44.530> week<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:44.980> could<00:00:45.130> be<00:00:45.310> you<00:00:45.610> know

could be this week it could be you know
today<00:00:46.150> i'm<00:00:46.660> not<00:00:46.870> really<00:00:46.960> sure<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.710> depends<00:00:48.100> on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
today i'm not really sure it depends on

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.280 
today i'm not really sure it depends on
how<00:00:48.340> busy<00:00:48.550> they<00:00:48.850> are<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.300> if<00:00:49.720> they<00:00:49.870> get<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.140> my

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
how busy they are and if they get to my

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.830 
how busy they are and if they get to my
report<00:00:50.650> or<00:00:50.740> when<00:00:50.890> they<00:00:51.010> actually<00:00:51.160> get<00:00:51.490> to<00:00:51.550> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
report or when they actually get to it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.960
