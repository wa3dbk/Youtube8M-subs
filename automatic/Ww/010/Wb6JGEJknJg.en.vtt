00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.330
 in the series the most cakes 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.849
 easy of the world 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.059
 today the 4/4 at the very red lights 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.250
 simple a weight in nine years sugar in 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.450
 ander flour not make it simpler 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.410
 there will be a little kind of chemistry 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.810
 for that push but you will see 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.150
 it's too much too simple and 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.020
 against it's economical and more 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.700
 too easy to do 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.770
 rafa is gasping parts then 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.320
 left we start with the bar words 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:36.230
 that we have softened in the end they do not have 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.150
 melted month records soften butter 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.440
 it is softened or you spend a whole 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.060
 little bit in the microwave for it to be 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.410
 a little bit soft or so you have 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.910
 the master you go out in your kitchen 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.950
 in the smallest place is your 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.010
 cooking and a good hour to the advanced 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.940
 ok so let's go put sugar 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.630
 you put me a little vanilla sugar 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.630
 these moments 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.570
 here we have a mixture of butter and sugar 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.370
 well homogeneous and we will watch them one by 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.740
 a girard be a little bit so the 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:17.850
 mix because they make me cullens 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.920
 normal to slaps and we start to 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.650
 beat in the egg 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.300
 there is no body of water in fact she has 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.350
 trouble mixing with the fat of the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.509
 Butter 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 here we have a mixture here we have a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:37.950
 homogeneous mixture we will put the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:40.170
 second goal the cake over ends 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.860
 almost finished we have to add the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
 flour but all the varenne of a sudden 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.690
 the baking powder so the cake reid 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.119
 inches and I add a beautiful 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.780
 pinch of salt for barley soil for the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.970
 taste to thwart the taste of sugar 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.340
 sugar butter and know that's what 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.729
 makes a nice cake 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.729
 Well, we did it 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 Here we put in this great mix 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:16.580
 homogeneous and cattle and we will put it 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.410
 in your mold 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.690
 as I'm going to add fees range 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.880
 here so raspberries I'm going to do 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.840
 a small layer of dough 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.980
 I ride in two and human 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.270
 raspberries at best and I put some 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.660
 raspberries in the middle it's clever all 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.250
 was packed deep down I hope 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.780
 normally it'll do it so I put 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.080
 frozen raspberries no need to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.350
 thaw vote of fresh never had it 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.380
 come back a little cheaper close are you 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.720
 me the last layer is here it is 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:55.940
 complete so the rest is not you we 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.010
 give to be uniformly so I finish 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.630
 by some raspberries on the top 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.340
 it's for fun it's for doing it 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.989
 but not obliged but I like I 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.090
 am greedy and then I have a slight 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.430
 cake since you put fruit there our 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.470
 famous 4/4 at the traffic lights is ready to 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.410
 to go in cooking we learned to heat 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.360
 your oven to 175 degrees and there we go the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.370
 leather between 35 and 45 minutes depending on 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.530
 size of your mold according to your oven 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.390
 the quality of your oven and the true true 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.470
 test to check the cooking this is the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.400
 tip of the knife that must come out 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.530
 dried 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.370
 once the qatar and then go i there 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.860
 go because I really have very very 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.120
 loud you saw this cake the sport 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.830
 really made us want to do it 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.570
 because a 4/4 with red fruits is 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.530
 super good and the natural acidity of 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.269
 red fruit business you'll have 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.440
 to something lighter it's 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.610
 really very very greedy the longest 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.630
 a year really really it's 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.840
 to wait until they cool down 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.840
 enjoyed
