00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
where you already have a fold and you're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.340 
where you already have a fold and you're
going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.340> bring<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:10.850> edge<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.080> edge

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
going to bring this edge to this edge

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.190 
going to bring this edge to this edge
here<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.030> going<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.360> make<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> triangle

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
here and it's going to make a triangle

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080 
here and it's going to make a triangle
in<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> center<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.640> want<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.910> go<00:02:17.000> ahead

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
in the center that you want to go ahead

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:28.770 
in the center that you want to go ahead
and<00:02:17.300> crease<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.080> get<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.350> up

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:42.970 

and<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.930> triangle<00:02:30.590> needs<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.980> go<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:41.770> fold<00:02:42.770> it

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and the triangle needs to go in fold it

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.200 
and the triangle needs to go in fold it
over<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.610> you'll<00:02:43.910> increase<00:02:44.390> carry<00:02:44.990> up<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
over and you'll increase carry up and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.950 
over and you'll increase carry up and
then<00:02:47.210> do<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.570> other<00:02:47.600> side<00:02:52.300> then<00:02:53.300> bringing<00:02:53.720> it

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
then do the other side then bringing it

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:16.600 
then do the other side then bringing it
up<00:02:58.180> making<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.240> triangle<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.280> we've<00:03:16.400> made<00:03:16.550> our

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
up making a triangle so we've made our

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.760 
up making a triangle so we've made our
base<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.510> then<00:03:17.750> if<00:03:17.900> we<00:03:18.050> proceeded<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.740> the

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
base and then if we proceeded to do the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.910 
base and then if we proceeded to do the
same<00:03:19.070> with<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.670> lid<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.680> would<00:03:21.680> come<00:03:21.890> out

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
same with the lid you would come out

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.490 
same with the lid you would come out
