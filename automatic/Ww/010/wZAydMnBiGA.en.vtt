00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:06.759 

today<00:00:05.359> we're<00:00:05.569> on<00:00:05.630> the<00:00:05.660> yeast<00:00:06.019> side<00:00:06.410> and

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:06.769 
today we're on the yeast side and

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.009 
today we're on the yeast side and
fermentation<00:00:07.269> side<00:00:08.269> of<00:00:08.450> the<00:00:08.510> brewery<00:00:08.780> and

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
fermentation side of the brewery and

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.040 
fermentation side of the brewery and
right<00:00:09.800> now<00:00:09.950> we<00:00:10.010> are<00:00:10.130> cropping<00:00:10.519> yeast<00:00:10.910> from<00:00:11.720> the

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
right now we are cropping yeast from the

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.029 
right now we are cropping yeast from the
london<00:00:13.010> pride<00:00:13.340> ale<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.680> you<00:00:15.680> can<00:00:15.800> see<00:00:15.950> the

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
london pride ale and you can see the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.460 
london pride ale and you can see the
yeast<00:00:16.279> is<00:00:16.519> flowing<00:00:16.939> out<00:00:17.119> of<00:00:17.180> conical<00:00:18.170> from<00:00:18.380> the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
yeast is flowing out of conical from the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.730 
yeast is flowing out of conical from the
bottom<00:00:18.800> and<00:00:19.660> through<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.780> hose<00:00:20.960> it's

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
bottom and through the hose it's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.769 
bottom and through the hose it's
actually<00:00:21.890> traveling<00:00:22.640> quite<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.119> ways<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.690> the

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
actually traveling quite a ways to the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.460 
actually traveling quite a ways to the
east<00:00:23.960> tank<00:00:24.550> this<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.699> really<00:00:25.850> the<00:00:26.029> way<00:00:26.119> that

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
east tank this is really the way that

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.470 
east tank this is really the way that
yeast<00:00:27.470> is<00:00:27.680> going<00:00:27.859> to<00:00:27.920> be<00:00:28.090> taken<00:00:29.090> from<00:00:29.300> the

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
yeast is going to be taken from the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.000 
yeast is going to be taken from the
vessels<00:00:29.900> here<00:00:30.140> as<00:00:30.380> London<00:00:31.369> has<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.870> bottom

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
vessels here as London has a bottom

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.880 
vessels here as London has a bottom
fermenting<00:00:34.010> yeast<00:00:34.660> it<00:00:35.660> is<00:00:35.840> an<00:00:36.170> alias<00:00:36.530> but<00:00:36.800> it

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
fermenting yeast it is an alias but it

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.880 
fermenting yeast it is an alias but it
is<00:00:37.010> bottom<00:00:37.220> fermenting<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.500> we'll<00:00:39.500> grab<00:00:39.770> the

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
is bottom fermenting so we'll grab the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.940 
is bottom fermenting so we'll grab the
yeast<00:00:40.070> from<00:00:40.280> different<00:00:40.610> beers<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.950> really

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
yeast from different beers and really

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.790 
yeast from different beers and really
take<00:00:43.130> as<00:00:43.280> much<00:00:43.430> as<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.760> can<00:00:43.969> to<00:00:44.270> put<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.840> into<00:00:45.140> a

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
take as much as we can to put it into a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.979 
take as much as we can to put it into a
vessel<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.370> will<00:00:46.550> be<00:00:46.719> reusing<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.840> youth

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
vessel that will be reusing the youth

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.220 
vessel that will be reusing the youth
for<00:00:48.290> future<00:00:48.559> beers<00:00:48.879> but<00:00:49.879> there's<00:00:50.570> more<00:00:50.989> youth

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
for future beers but there's more youth

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.369 
for future beers but there's more youth
because<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:52.460> reproduces<00:00:53.270> in<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.960> beers<00:00:54.170> and

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
because it reproduces in the beers and

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.520 
because it reproduces in the beers and
it<00:00:54.440> makes<00:00:54.620> more<00:00:55.160> than<00:00:55.219> Fuller's<00:00:55.700> can<00:00:55.879> use

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
it makes more than Fuller's can use

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.350 
it makes more than Fuller's can use
birth<00:00:57.530> future<00:00:57.920> beers<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.610> lot<00:00:59.059> of<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.270> is

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
birth future beers so a lot of it is

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.049 
birth future beers so a lot of it is
actually<00:00:59.539> housed<00:00:59.899> on<00:01:00.200> to<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.860> farm<00:01:01.160> where<00:01:01.430> pigs

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
actually housed on to a farm where pigs

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.209 
actually housed on to a farm where pigs
will<00:01:02.210> eat<00:01:02.270> it<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:03.500> fact<00:01:03.860> just<00:01:04.009> recently

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
will eat it and in fact just recently

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.940 
will eat it and in fact just recently
there's<00:01:04.820> been<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:05.000> contract<00:01:05.570> with<00:01:05.899> a<00:01:06.170> Japanese

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
there's been a contract with a Japanese

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.999 
there's been a contract with a Japanese
distillery<00:01:07.819> where<00:01:08.479> they're<00:01:08.630> using<00:01:09.020> Fuller's

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
distillery where they're using Fuller's

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.999 
distillery where they're using Fuller's
East<00:01:10.329> to<00:01:11.329> make<00:01:11.479> whiskey<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.529> that's<00:01:12.740> still<00:01:12.889> in

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
East to make whiskey so that's still in

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.059 
East to make whiskey so that's still in
the<00:01:13.100> experimental<00:01:13.369> stage<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.920> hopefully<00:01:15.920> we

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 
the experimental stage and hopefully we

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.499 
the experimental stage and hopefully we
may<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.399> able<00:01:16.520> taste<00:01:16.789> some<00:01:16.999> of<00:01:17.029> that<00:01:17.209> whiskey

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
may be able taste some of that whiskey

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.569 
may be able taste some of that whiskey
before<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.779> leave<00:01:18.049> but<00:01:18.439> it's<00:01:19.069> not<00:01:19.279> I<00:01:19.310> may

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
before I leave but it's not I may

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.099 
before I leave but it's not I may

actually be able to visit the distillery

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.599 
actually be able to visit the distillery
when<00:01:21.709> i<00:01:21.740> get<00:01:21.829> to<00:01:21.979> japan<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.090> right<00:01:23.209> now<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:24.109> have

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
when i get to japan so right now we have

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.760 
when i get to japan so right now we have
the<00:01:25.609> shish<00:01:25.819> tank<00:01:26.149> here<00:01:26.450> we<00:01:27.439> can<00:01:27.560> see<00:01:27.740> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
the shish tank here we can see the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.300 
the shish tank here we can see the
london<00:01:28.609> pride<00:01:28.759> yeast<00:01:29.029> is<00:01:29.859> filling<00:01:30.859> up<00:01:30.950> pretty

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
london pride yeast is filling up pretty

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.870 
london pride yeast is filling up pretty
quickly<00:01:31.579> this<00:01:32.419> is<00:01:32.599> actually<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.200> second<00:01:33.880> tank

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
quickly this is actually the second tank

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.599 
quickly this is actually the second tank
that<00:01:35.179> has<00:01:35.299> been<00:01:35.569> feeling<00:01:35.959> from<00:01:36.259> this<00:01:36.609> conical

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
that has been feeling from this conical

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.409 
that has been feeling from this conical
fermenter<00:01:38.649> now<00:01:39.649> this<00:01:40.130> yeast<00:01:40.459> because<00:01:41.149> we

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:41.419 
fermenter now this yeast because we

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:44.499 
fermenter now this yeast because we
already<00:01:41.569> have<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> full<00:01:42.490> tank<00:01:43.490> for<00:01:43.819> reuse<00:01:44.209> is

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
already have a full tank for reuse is

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.749 
already have a full tank for reuse is
going<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.049> going<00:01:45.200> off<00:01:45.469> to<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.859> farm<00:01:46.099> for<00:01:46.340> pc

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
going to be going off to the farm for pc

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.830 
going to be going off to the farm for pc
but<00:01:47.749> uh

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
but uh

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.399 
but uh
it's<00:01:49.770> great<00:01:50.070> yeasted<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.560> nutrition<00:01:53.039> so

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
it's great yeasted I and nutrition so

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.139 
it's great yeasted I and nutrition so
once<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.590> fills<00:01:55.890> up<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.340> truck<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
once this fills up the truck is going to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.899 
once this fills up the truck is going to
come<00:01:57.359> to<00:01:57.569> some<00:01:57.689> outside<00:01:58.200> tanks<00:01:59.069> and<00:01:59.429> takes

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
come to some outside tanks and takes

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
come to some outside tanks and takes
away
