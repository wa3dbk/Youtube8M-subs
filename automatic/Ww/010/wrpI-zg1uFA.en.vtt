00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
give it another chance I picked up some

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.380 
give it another chance I picked up some
gauntlets<00:01:52.260> where<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.640> increased<00:01:54.060> reload

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
gauntlets where I have increased reload

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
gauntlets where I have increased reload
speed<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.870> that<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.260> helps<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.800> lot<00:01:55.950> with

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
speed and that really helps a lot with

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.750 
speed and that really helps a lot with
this<00:01:56.700> gun<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> recommend<00:01:59.010> that<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> equip

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
this gun so I recommend that you equip

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.880 
this gun so I recommend that you equip
gauntlets<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.510> improve<00:02:00.900> reload<00:02:01.229> speed<00:02:01.470> with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
gauntlets that improve reload speed with

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.400 
gauntlets that improve reload speed with
hand<00:02:02.190> cannons<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:03.450> definitely<00:02:03.869> helps<00:02:04.229> out

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
hand cannons it definitely helps out

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.170 
hand cannons it definitely helps out
with<00:02:04.650> this<00:02:04.830> gun<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> reload<00:02:05.970> speed

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
with this gun because the reload speed

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.560 
with this gun because the reload speed
is<00:02:06.450> extremely<00:02:07.110> slow<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.880> once<00:02:09.090> you've<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
is extremely slow so once you've got the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.420 
is extremely slow so once you've got the
upgrades<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.110> thorn<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.619> you've<00:02:11.039> got<00:02:11.220> some

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
upgrades for thorn and you've got some

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.010 
upgrades for thorn and you've got some
gauntlets<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.030> improve<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.480> reload<00:02:12.780> speed

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
gauntlets that improve your reload speed

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
