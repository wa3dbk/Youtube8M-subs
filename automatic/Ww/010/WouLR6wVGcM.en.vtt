00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 all this can really be finished for 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.790
 lfs either everything just starts for 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.309
 arcades 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.059
 so lower base team arcade top 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.280
 base fs 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.349
 and now you can think about what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 It seems to be and Arkady can be fed to 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.740
 but I think it's still not a defense. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.930
 so if they have a 1390 and protection from 90-mi 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.160
 this is wrong i think if stock 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 guns and it will all be aimed at fighting 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.380
 medication yes this here is an og-like look 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 valley view 2 mines lower base this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.969
 access to the center from the very beginning 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.640
 But here pay attention 30 deuce the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.579
 one and enough scales because enough 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.800
 since i have two tanks on the island 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.899
 what they do is the same kontra you them 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.670
 riding to the center and if you are criminal 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.289
 here is not fillet and again the city who 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.090
 Now you can work and so we need 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.460
 once the arch itself so wrong 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.870
 June 90 did not have time to work, they are very 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 many missed and then the arcade pro 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.980
 This received angel killer in response gave on 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.320
 nickel at u double fingers so on 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.510
 the joker is now hanging out and his problems 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.970
 not sharing tarot should be generally like so 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.520
 all oh how bad for looking for a sponsor 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.030
 lower base occupies a hill lower base 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.340
 takes race in the first minute to the loss 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 fso advantage spawn nuvola 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.450
 arcade also gave damage to the brush 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 control of military virginity in the light and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.479
 won grenadier now somewhere far away 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.600
 he can start work now 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 moves from more precisely setting changes 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.340

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.369
 push further to the end 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.619
 devyanostyakov completely and everything is fine 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 and everything goes under the dictation team arcade 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 occupied a hill took positions here go 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.000

 then fight the ends of Armageddon 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.530
 getting roads 1 break through and exit 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.840

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.149
 minus 31, and here there is 1 loss 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.549
 here it is the final departure and eblu focus 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.039
 need 90 cover up the looking command 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.929
 Sponsor can get into the trap arcade 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.329
 already red Jared takes summer 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.269
 we were taken back 69 but armageddon then 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.599
 archive jared do not take risks very much and 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.370
 32 arcade teams could now too 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.040
 get what's the 90s and leave and you're in 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.349
 frame in the hangar is different in the frame and here we are 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 discharged and damage to the body should be 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.930
 Arma need to take minus Armageddon 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.340
 remain in troy lfs and so 43 and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.500
 great opportunity to finish 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.420
 first set in their favor for the team 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.579
 arcade just winning two cards 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.169
 You see, and we were afraid that in a subtle way 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.419
 that i'm a friend walks see one tank 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.519
 stays on the island now this 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.530
 annihilator capture base went need 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.689
 shoot down somebody but not capture it 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.459
 see but knock anyone down to on the very 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.069
 business at this time contact and at the base 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.769
 teams arcade sees there nines 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.930
 now here sees the annihilator circuit 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.870
 some sort of capture will be from lfs 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.870
 destroy 4 in 2 already in three eights 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.459
 there are no guys and the first is a good block 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.169
 pro and bold on center annihilator when 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.819
 order can hardly help here 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:16.049
 on the center base, well, they occupy a hill 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.479
 look 90 in the hill 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.099
 here left leads away safe jared will 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.989
 will highlight and work even if 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.970
 will bring down capture it will not save anything 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 a lot of life but still much 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.090
 more true not true like that 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.260
 monastery closes 200 two eras and he 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.530
 just went all over here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.109
 pedestal shoot or for dates shows size 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.909
 22 you once again not terrible but inflicted 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.250
 damage annihilator from the back comes minus 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.519
 you are the first peer die for nothing he killed you 1 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.290
 it was necessary here one considering that but 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.319
 full of them but take it without any problems 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.810
 it's 1390 and wang should win the center 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.060
 against angelkiller and jarad there are three 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.359
 shatal vonka let's break the tank cover 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.829
 the crust -15 here will also cover the column 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.419
 now you will work first 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.040
 from behind the net I hung a lot of damage 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.290
 Now patrina not punch and set fire 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.430
 killer von porsche watkins cpss should 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.650
 give a minus he goes to the ram 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.359
