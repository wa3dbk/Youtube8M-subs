00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
with Alan not much I actually knew I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.069 
with Alan not much I actually knew I
actually<00:03:17.920> heard<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.609> but<00:03:19.299> no<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.510> thought<00:03:19.870> I

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
actually heard of it but no I thought I

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.849 
actually heard of it but no I thought I
know<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.500> no<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:23.019> really<00:03:23.319> an<00:03:23.680> interesting

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
know it no it's really an interesting

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.059 
know it no it's really an interesting
color<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:25.450> gotta<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:25.900> there<00:03:26.079> for<00:03:26.109> reason<00:03:26.709> I

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
color it's gotta be there for reason I

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:36.660 
color it's gotta be there for reason I
think<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.030> actually<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:29.290> absorb<00:03:35.400> odors<00:03:36.400> but

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
think it's actually to absorb odors but

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:47.449 
think it's actually to absorb odors but
they<00:03:36.819> want<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:37.989> actually<00:03:38.319> has<00:03:38.409> a<00:03:38.439> cottage

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
