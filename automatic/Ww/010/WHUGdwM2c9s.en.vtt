right now we are at the final cut to see
who<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.670> make<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.660> path<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
who we think can make the path and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.980 
who we think can make the path and
really<00:02:23.650> getting<00:02:24.040> down<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.550> wire<00:02:24.990> and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
really getting down to the wire and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.090 
really getting down to the wire and
we'll<00:02:26.200> see<00:02:26.350> what<00:02:26.470> happens

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
we'll see what happens

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:36.060 
we'll see what happens
I<00:02:33.420> think<00:02:34.420> returning<00:02:34.900> dancers<00:02:35.350> obviously<00:02:35.980> you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
I think returning dancers obviously you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.280 
I think returning dancers obviously you
have<00:02:36.220> more<00:02:36.430> pressure<00:02:36.760> than<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.870> girls<00:02:38.110> that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
have more pressure than the girls that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.170 
have more pressure than the girls that
are<00:02:38.380> auditioning<00:02:38.800> for<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.130> first<00:02:39.340> time<00:02:39.610> it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
are auditioning for the first time it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.730 
are auditioning for the first time it
was<00:02:40.300> definitely<00:02:40.660> nerve-racking<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.380> us

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
was definitely nerve-racking for us

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.440 
was definitely nerve-racking for us
because<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.790> never<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.210> they're<00:02:43.360> gonna

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
because you never know if they're gonna

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.050 
because you never know if they're gonna
take<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.780> back<00:02:43.960> again<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.850> now<00:02:45.850> we're<00:02:46.030> just

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
take you back again so now we're just

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.330 
take you back again so now we're just
all<00:02:46.330> hoping<00:02:46.600> for<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.900> best<00:02:47.050> so<00:02:47.410> far<00:02:47.440> we've

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
all hoping for the best so far we've

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.420 
all hoping for the best so far we've
gotten<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.730> far<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.980> we're<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.010> hoping

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
gotten this far so we're just hoping

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.710 
gotten this far so we're just hoping
that<00:02:51.580> we'll<00:02:51.730> go<00:02:51.850> over<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> way<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.390> hopefully

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
that we'll go over the way and hopefully

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.930 
that we'll go over the way and hopefully
have<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.200> team<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:53.740> last<00:02:53.980> year<00:02:54.220> plus<00:02:54.460> even
