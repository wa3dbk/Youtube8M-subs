00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
to know what the best rep ranges are for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.980 
to know what the best rep ranges are for
strength<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.340> muscle<00:00:14.540> he<00:00:15.540> goes<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
strength and muscle he goes on to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.349 
strength and muscle he goes on to
describe<00:00:16.020> how<00:00:16.320> he's<00:00:16.619> using<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.070> new<00:00:17.359> training

describe how he's using a new training

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.769 
describe how he's using a new training
program<00:00:18.810> called<00:00:19.430> wkm<00:00:20.430> I'm<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.359> familiar<00:00:21.539> with

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
program called wkm I'm not familiar with

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.050 
program called wkm I'm not familiar with
that<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:23.130> anyway<00:00:23.369> he's<00:00:23.490> given<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
that so but anyway he's given in a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.279 
that so but anyway he's given in a
little<00:00:24.359> bit<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> breakdown<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
little bit of a breakdown of the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.700 
little bit of a breakdown of the
exercise<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.949> he's<00:00:26.130> using<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.500> guess<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
exercise that he's using I guess on the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
exercise that he's using I guess on the
first<00:00:29.070> day<00:00:29.310> their<00:00:29.519> squats<00:00:29.910> bench<00:00:30.179> rest<00:00:30.480> bent

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750

over rows and on the second day there's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.900 
over rows and on the second day there's
deadlift<00:00:33.809> military<00:00:34.469> press<00:00:34.710> chin-ups<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sets of eight to twelve now I'm not

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.950 
sets of eight to twelve now I'm not
exactly<00:00:52.500> sure<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.250> objective<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.329> with

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
exactly sure the objective here is with

exactly sure the objective here is with
regard<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> wkn<00:00:56.219> method<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.570> our<00:00:57.840> friend

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
regard to the wkn method but our friend

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
regard to the wkn method but our friend
skirt<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.270> wants<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:01.010> would<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
skirt and wants to know would you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
skirt and wants to know would you
suggest<00:01:02.370> instead<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.329> three<00:01:03.660> sets<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
suggest instead that I do three sets of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
suggest instead that I do three sets of
five<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:05.250> exercises<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> look

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
five on these exercises so that I look

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.890 
five on these exercises so that I look
more<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.189> power<00:01:08.400> lifter<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.689> that's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
more like a power lifter right that's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.219 
more like a power lifter right that's
what<00:01:09.990> he<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what he is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.670 
what he is
and<00:01:10.939> if<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.479> rep<00:01:12.720> ranges<00:01:13.140> should<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.439> use

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and if not what rep ranges should I use

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
and if not what rep ranges should I use
should<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.040> lower<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.869> forth

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
should I go lower so on and so forth

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
should I go lower so on and so forth
he's<00:01:16.500> 23<00:01:16.830> 5<00:01:17.369> foot<00:01:17.610> 7<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.619> 154<00:01:19.619> pounds<00:01:19.920> here's<00:01:20.909> a

he's 23 5 foot 7 and 154 pounds here's a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.690 
he's 23 5 foot 7 and 154 pounds here's a
situation<00:01:21.530> because<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.189> even<00:01:23.460> sure

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
situation because I'm not even sure

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.749 
situation because I'm not even sure
you're<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.000> clear<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.280> question

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you're very clear on what your question

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
you're very clear on what your question
is<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.200> objective<00:01:28.680> objective<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
is and what your objective objective is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.819 
is and what your objective objective is
so<00:01:29.939> I'm<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> give<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.840> few<00:01:31.409> different

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
so I'm going to give you a few different

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
so I'm going to give you a few different
ideas<00:01:32.000> first<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.290> said<00:01:34.439> those

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
ideas first of all like I said those

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.179 
ideas first of all like I said those
exercises<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:35.189> awesome<00:01:36.200> strength<00:01:37.200> building

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
exercises are awesome strength building

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
exercises are awesome strength building
and<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.060> general<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and this is all very general because it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.870 
and this is all very general because it
depends<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> individual<00:01:41.400> depends<00:01:41.790> on

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
depends on the individual depends on

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
depends on the individual depends on
your<00:01:42.000> training<00:01:42.329> age<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> very<00:01:43.380> first

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
your training age that's the very first

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
your training age that's the very first
thing<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.890> thought<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> put

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
thing that I thought of because you put

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.609 
thing that I thought of because you put
your<00:01:45.060> age<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.390> 23<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.470> thinking

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
your age was 23 but then I'm thinking

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.620 
your age was 23 but then I'm thinking
you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.070> training<00:01:47.640> age<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> lot<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.450> do

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you know training age has a lot to do

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.910 
you know training age has a lot to do
with<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.170> 18<00:01:49.409> year<00:01:49.530> old<00:01:49.680> kids<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
with it I have some 18 year old kids a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.730 
with it I have some 18 year old kids a
train<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.399> who's<00:01:50.850> training<00:01:51.299> age<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.960> 5<00:01:52.259> years

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
train here who's training age is 5 years

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.429 
train here who's training age is 5 years
and<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:54.000> their<00:01:54.659> body<00:01:54.840> responds<00:01:55.380> very

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and they can their body responds very

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
and they can their body responds very
differently<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.189> stimulus

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
differently to different stimulus

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
differently to different stimulus
different<00:01:57.509> rep<00:01:57.630> ranges<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.110> different

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
different rep ranges and different

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920 
different rep ranges and different
exercises<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.180> 23<00:02:00.630> years<00:02:00.659> old

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
exercises then if you are 23 years old

you're using rep ranges that support you
in<00:02:52.940> getting<00:02:53.299> stronger<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.840> your<00:02:54.170> exercises

in getting stronger in your exercises
and<00:02:55.129> that's<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.810> don't<00:02:57.049> care<00:02:57.409> about

and that's it you don't care about

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.360 
and that's it you don't care about
anything<00:02:57.950> else

anything else

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.800 
anything else
you<00:02:58.730> do<00:02:58.909> what<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> have<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.420> do<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.689> it's

you do what you have to do and it's

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.000 
you do what you have to do and it's
generally<00:03:00.109> going<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.319> mean<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.769> lift

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
generally going to mean that you lift

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.500 
generally going to mean that you lift
heavy<00:03:01.189> you<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.370> high<00:03:01.639> intensities<00:03:02.299> that

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
heavy you have high intensities that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.349 
heavy you have high intensities that
you're<00:03:02.900> lifting<00:03:03.049> for<00:03:03.379> low<00:03:03.530> volumes<00:03:04.359> frequency

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
you're lifting for low volumes frequency

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.670 
you're lifting for low volumes frequency
depending<00:03:05.780> on<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.900> program<00:03:06.200> may<00:03:06.349> be<00:03:06.379> higher

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
depending on the program may be higher

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.670 
depending on the program may be higher
and<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.639> might<00:03:07.790> include<00:03:08.120> some<00:03:08.810> speed<00:03:09.170> work<00:03:09.439> or

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
and you might include some speed work or

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.440 
and you might include some speed work or
you<00:03:09.920> know<00:03:09.950> supplemental<00:03:10.760> exercises<00:03:11.329> but

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
you know supplemental exercises but

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.780 
you know supplemental exercises but
that's<00:03:11.629> it<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.769> generally<00:03:13.099> speaking<00:03:13.129> you<00:03:13.700> know

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that's it so generally speaking you know

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.550 
that's it so generally speaking you know
1<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.090> 5<00:03:14.269> reps<00:03:14.980> ok<00:03:16.060> wkm<00:03:17.060> suggests<00:03:17.629> 812<00:03:18.349> reps

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
1 to 5 reps ok wkm suggests 812 reps

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.199 
1 to 5 reps ok wkm suggests 812 reps
that<00:03:18.919> tells<00:03:19.190> me<00:03:19.310> right<00:03:19.519> away<00:03:19.639> that<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.090> a

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
that tells me right away that this is a

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.199 
that tells me right away that this is a
bodybuilding<00:03:20.720> program<00:03:21.310> right<00:03:22.340> most

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
bodybuilding program right most

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.000 
bodybuilding program right most
powerlifting<00:03:23.629> programs<00:03:23.989> are<00:03:24.650> not<00:03:24.799> going<00:03:24.949> to

powerlifting programs are not going to

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.129 
powerlifting programs are not going to
be<00:03:25.069> eight<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.280> twelve<00:03:25.489> reps<00:03:25.669> it's<00:03:26.090> just<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:27.049> a

be eight to twelve reps it's just it's a

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.390 
be eight to twelve reps it's just it's a
bodybuilding<00:03:27.590> parameter<00:03:27.919> H<00:03:28.040> as<00:03:28.159> well<00:03:28.250> was

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
bodybuilding parameter H as well was

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.039 
bodybuilding parameter H as well was
great<00:03:28.609> for<00:03:28.790> bodybuilding<00:03:29.329> right<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:32.049> that

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
great for bodybuilding right so that

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.720 
great for bodybuilding right so that
would<00:03:33.260> be<00:03:33.409> clear<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:34.129> answer<00:03:34.400> would<00:03:34.519> make

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
would be clear the answer would make

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.000 
would be clear the answer would make
