00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello to today's video I want you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.280
 show the essence of the original tunic from 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.770
 ordinary large scarf or shawl 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.710
 enjoy your viewing 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.410
 First you need to decide on the fabric 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.320
 for such a tunic fit lightweight fabric 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.130
 for example cotton chiffon silk and others 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.169
 materials 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.019
 I will use a great summer 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.249
 scarf from translucent plov with 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.340
 sides of 95 by 180 cm can buy 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.920
 a piece of fabric 2 meters long and 1 wide 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.470
 meter to start fold the fabric in half 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.620
 face up 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.670
 we get almost a square with sides 95 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.580
 it is width and 90 is the length from the top 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.640
 the left edge down measure the segment is 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.280
 30 centimeters it will be the girth of the sleeve 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.920
 We do the same thing from the opposite 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.470
 side now proceed to the main 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 parts of the cries need to measure the girth 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.870
 my chest for example I have 90 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 centimeters to this label add 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 an additional 20 centimeters per 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.260
 free edge since my fabric is not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.500
 and I want the tunic to be 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 a little free to measure 110 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.020
 centimeters then this measure 110 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.040
 centimeters we divide in half and get 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 measure 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.330
 one side of the chest line is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 55 years since the width of my fabric is 95 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.500
 centimeters I subtract from it to measure by 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.070
 one side of the chest 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.159
 equal to 50 cm and getting 40 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.009
 where 40 centimeters it will be 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.039
 for the free edge on the sides of everything too 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.710
 divide in half and get 20 centimeters 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.750
 this is the distance to the sides of the sleeves 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.420
 tunics 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.520
 so when got the calculations we transfer 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 all the measurements on the fabric from the edge merten 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.880
 girth sleeves to the right postpone 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.210
 section 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.670
 equal to 20 cm from this point down 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.770
 put off a straight vertical line 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.650
 do the same thing from the other side 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 Now we take a sewing machine and with the front 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.720
 we put two vertical sides 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.880
 straight line from the armpit 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.459
 down the top draw the line of the mouth not 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.500
 forget that the front part is deeper than 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.590
 name is left to make 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.750
 small decorative sport and bottom for 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.850
 this i will need two rubber bands in 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.730
 one centimeter wide and long 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.020
 about 20 cm 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.570
 turn that thread on the wrong side 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.480
 side and one side from the bottom edge 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.909
 start on the phone 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.030
 left resident time as we support 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:46.379
 stretched and the fabric is exactly 100 and on the other 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.379
 side paving line 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.880
 and so my summer blouse is ready if 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.770
