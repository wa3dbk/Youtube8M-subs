00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
it had nothing on it so it's got a ton

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
it had nothing on it so it's got a ton
of<00:01:15.070> mods<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> sport<00:01:18.370> bars<00:01:18.550> actually<00:01:18.760> made

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
of mods and the sport bars actually made

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.270 
of mods and the sport bars actually made
a<00:01:19.090> huge<00:01:19.690> difference<00:01:20.260> way<00:01:20.740> more<00:01:20.770> comfortable

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
a huge difference way more comfortable

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
a huge difference way more comfortable
than<00:01:21.990> before<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:26.110> stance<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.700> lot<00:01:28.000> better

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
than before the stance is a lot better

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.300 
than before the stance is a lot better
so<00:01:29.320> it's<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> lot<00:01:29.590> more<00:01:29.710> comfortable<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.130> ride

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
so it's a lot more comfortable to ride

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.360 
so it's a lot more comfortable to ride
get<00:01:30.790> underneath<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.630> wind<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:33.010> wind<00:01:33.130> chill

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
get underneath the wind the wind chill

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.940 
get underneath the wind the wind chill
also<00:01:33.700> is<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.880> huge<00:01:34.300> difference<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:34.950> really

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
also is a huge difference and really

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.410 
also is a huge difference and really
recommend<00:01:36.340> getting<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.700> after<00:01:37.030> Mike<00:01:37.300> a

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
recommend getting it after Mike a
