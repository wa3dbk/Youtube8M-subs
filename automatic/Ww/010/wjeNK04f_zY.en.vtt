so<00:00:18.330> here's<00:00:18.930> Trixie<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.859> three<00:00:20.130> weeks<00:00:20.340> later

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
so here's Trixie it's three weeks later

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.220 
so here's Trixie it's three weeks later
since<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.119> started<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.189> probably<00:00:23.189> have

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
since we started on it I probably have

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
since we started on it I probably have
60<00:00:25.230> hours<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> fabrication<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.670> thing

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
60 hours and fabrication on this thing

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.800 
60 hours and fabrication on this thing
making<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.260> thing<00:00:28.320> happen<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.179> our

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
making this thing happen and so our

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.209 
making this thing happen and so our
fabrication<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.189> done<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:34.219> she's

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
fabrication is just about done and she's

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
fabrication is just about done and she's
ready<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.670> torn<00:00:36.180> down<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
ready to get torn down and going to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.319 
ready to get torn down and going to
powder<00:00:37.829> coater<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.610> finished<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.300> let's

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
powder coater and get finished so let's

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.549 
powder coater and get finished so let's
talk<00:00:39.870> about<00:00:39.930> rat<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.070> guess<00:00:41.579> we'll<00:00:42.410> work<00:00:43.410> from

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
talk about rat I guess we'll work from

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.430 
talk about rat I guess we'll work from
the<00:00:43.649> front<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> you'll<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.320> our

of<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.530> coolest<00:03:32.889> things<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.340> had<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.549> spend

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
of the coolest things I had to spend

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.349 
of the coolest things I had to spend
time<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.150> do<00:03:34.299> this<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
time to do this because of the the the

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.210 
time to do this because of the the the
way<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.630> motor<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.049> sprocket<00:03:38.560> geometry<00:03:39.099> is

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
way the motor and sprocket geometry is

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.940 
way the motor and sprocket geometry is
on<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:39.639> thing<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.120> decided<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.260> make<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> trick

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
on this thing I decided to make a trick

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.360 
on this thing I decided to make a trick
little<00:03:42.489> chain<00:03:42.909> tensioner<00:03:43.510> assembly<00:03:43.629> and<00:03:44.379> then

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
little chain tensioner assembly and then

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.180 
little chain tensioner assembly and then
what<00:03:45.849> makes<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.209> difference<00:03:46.689> is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
what makes this difference is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.590 
what makes this difference is
most<00:03:49.190> bikes<00:03:49.520> will<00:03:49.760> either<00:03:49.880> have<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.180> roller<00:03:50.510> on

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
most bikes will either have a roller on

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.740 
most bikes will either have a roller on
the<00:03:50.750> top<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.470> roller<00:03:51.709> on<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.130> bottom<00:03:52.750> but

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the top and a roller on the bottom but

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.280 
the top and a roller on the bottom but
being<00:03:54.290> long<00:03:54.560> travel<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.910> long<00:03:56.180> swinger

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
being long travel and the long swinger

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.530 
being long travel and the long swinger
got<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> lot<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:57.890> chain<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.280> deal<00:03:58.490> with<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.330> a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
got a lot of chain to deal with and a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.230 
got a lot of chain to deal with and a
lot<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.870> slack<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.730> basically

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
lot of slack and so I basically

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.490 
lot of slack and so I basically
engineered<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.380> fabbed<00:04:03.680> up<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:05.500> constant

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
engineered and fabbed up a constant

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.100 
engineered and fabbed up a constant
tension<00:04:07.060> spring-loaded<00:04:08.060> chain<00:04:08.510> tensioner

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
tension spring-loaded chain tensioner

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.230 
tension spring-loaded chain tensioner
that<00:04:09.290> actually<00:04:09.860> is<00:04:10.070> integral<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.820> swing

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
that actually is integral to the swing

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.530 
that actually is integral to the swing
arm<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:13.070> there's<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.640> lot<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:14.030> cue<00:04:14.270> fab

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
arm and so there's a lot of cue fab

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.539 
arm and so there's a lot of cue fab
trick<00:04:14.989> stuff<00:04:15.410> in<00:04:15.709> there<00:04:16.130> as<00:04:16.280> far<00:04:16.489> as

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
trick stuff in there as far as

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.680 
trick stuff in there as far as
engineering<00:04:16.940> goes<00:04:17.890> but<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:18.980> we're<00:04:19.130> fetching

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
engineering goes but it we're fetching

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.570 
engineering goes but it we're fetching
yeah<00:04:20.690> that's<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:21.049> mock<00:04:21.260> up<00:04:21.530> strut<00:04:21.919> in<00:04:22.130> there<00:04:22.340> to

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
yeah that's a mock up strut in there to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.150 
yeah that's a mock up strut in there to
set<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.120> ride<00:04:23.300> height<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:24.830> see<00:04:25.040> our

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
set the ride height you can see our

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.700 
set the ride height you can see our

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
other foot pegs done shifters done ah

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.300 
other foot pegs done shifters done ah
mocked<00:04:30.710> up<00:04:30.950> our<00:04:31.130> air<00:04:31.280> filter<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.060> carburetor

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
mocked up our air filter and carburetor

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.670 
mocked up our air filter and carburetor
for<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.510> yeah<00:04:35.510> big<00:04:35.870> dude<00:04:36.140> this<00:04:36.350> thing's<00:04:36.560> going

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
for it yeah big dude this thing's going

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.020 
for it yeah big dude this thing's going
to<00:04:36.740> have<00:04:37.600> HRD<00:04:38.600> 540<00:04:39.290> with<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.500> 46<00:04:40.220> 5<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:41.110> and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
to have HRD 540 with a 46 5 on it and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.510 
to have HRD 540 with a 46 5 on it and
what<00:04:44.030> we<00:04:44.150> can<00:04:44.180> also<00:04:44.480> see<00:04:44.840> is<00:04:44.990> our<00:04:45.520> plastic

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
what we can also see is our plastic

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.250 
what we can also see is our plastic
actually<00:04:47.120> those<00:04:47.360> are<00:04:47.540> actually<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.930> final

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
actually those are actually the final

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.000 
actually those are actually the final
