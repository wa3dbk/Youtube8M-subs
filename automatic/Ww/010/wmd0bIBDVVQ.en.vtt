00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.350 

alright<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.220> as<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.520> can<00:00:02.700> probably<00:00:02.970> guess

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
alright so as you can probably guess

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.499 
alright so as you can probably guess
from<00:00:03.899> what<00:00:04.650> these<00:00:04.830> are<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.490> am<00:00:05.940> definitely

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
from what these are that I am definitely

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.720 
from what these are that I am definitely
taking<00:00:07.140> out<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> old<00:00:07.529> bed<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.550> put

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
taking out the old bed and going to put

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.730 
taking out the old bed and going to put
in<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.019> will<00:00:10.139> actually<00:00:10.260> fit<00:00:10.559> back<00:00:10.710> there

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
in to that will actually fit back there

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.509 
in to that will actually fit back there
so<00:00:11.099> these<00:00:11.219> are<00:00:11.490> three<00:00:12.259> by<00:00:13.259> six<00:00:13.799> beds<00:00:14.070> two<00:00:14.400> of

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
so these are three by six beds two of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.480 
so these are three by six beds two of
them<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.940> that's<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.289> ever<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.740> 3<00:00:17.100> by<00:00:17.250> 6

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
them and that's what ever that is 3 by 6

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.260 
them and that's what ever that is 3 by 6
is<00:00:17.609> 18<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.119> 36<00:00:18.660> square<00:00:19.619> feet<00:00:20.010> roughly<00:00:20.820> not

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
is 18 so it's 36 square feet roughly not

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.230 
is 18 so it's 36 square feet roughly not
roughly<00:00:21.660> exactly<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.650> you're<00:00:23.279> doing<00:00:23.580> math<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
roughly exactly if you're doing math and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
roughly exactly if you're doing math and
a<00:00:24.960> normal<00:00:25.320> way<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.099> yeah<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> other<00:00:26.789> bed

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
a normal way but yeah but the other bed

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.150 
a normal way but yeah but the other bed
was<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> four<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.480> six<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.840> that's<00:00:27.990> 24<00:00:28.470> square

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
was a four by six so that's 24 square

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.540 
was a four by six so that's 24 square
feet<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.820> I'm<00:00:30.060> gonna<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:31.109> did<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.260> say<00:00:31.550> 36

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
feet so I'm gonna get what did I say 36

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.040 
feet so I'm gonna get what did I say 36
one<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.149> math<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.510> don't<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:33.719> whatever<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
one of my math I don't know whatever I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
one of my math I don't know whatever I
said<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.500> time<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.730> yeah<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
paint's drying got to put on a second

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.490 
paint's drying got to put on a second
coat<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.690> flip<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:43.020> over<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.290> paint

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
coat and then flip them over and paint

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.959 
coat and then flip them over and paint
the<00:00:43.649> bottom<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.879> yeah<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.420> pretty<00:00:45.570> fun

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
the bottom but but yeah it's pretty fun

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
the bottom but but yeah it's pretty fun
okay<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.329> literally<00:00:48.719> seconds<00:00:49.649> later<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
okay and so literally seconds later as I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
okay and so literally seconds later as I
walk<00:00:50.280> through<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.640> house<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.809> showing<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
walk through the house we're showing you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.529 
walk through the house we're showing you
what<00:00:52.579> what<00:00:53.579> we've<00:00:53.699> done<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.300> thinking<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
what what we've done I was thinking I

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.619 
what what we've done I was thinking I
was<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.090> tarp<00:00:57.090> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
was gonna have to to get a tarp but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
was gonna have to to get a tarp but
apparently<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:58.530> because<00:00:58.680> i<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.190> like

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
apparently not because i was just like

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
apparently not because i was just like
I'll<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.879> kind<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.059> pile<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.539> over<00:01:00.809> pull<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I'll just kind of pile it over pull the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.990 
I'll just kind of pile it over pull the
wood<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.070> obviously<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> dirt<00:01:02.730> even

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
wood out and obviously the dirt even

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.910 
wood out and obviously the dirt even
just<00:01:03.180> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> stays<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.379> where<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just kind of stays you know where it is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
just kind of stays you know where it is
it's<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.580> doing<00:01:05.790> four<00:01:06.510> feet<00:01:06.780> deep

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it's not like I'm doing four feet deep

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
it's not like I'm doing four feet deep
dirt<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.830> would<00:01:07.979> billow<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.030> side<00:01:09.240> if

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
dirt that would billow out the side if

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
dirt that would billow out the side if
you<00:01:09.540> took<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.439> took<00:01:10.500> everything<00:01:10.860> off<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you took you know took everything off so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
you took you know took everything off so
my<00:01:12.000> plan<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.750> shift<00:01:12.960> everything

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
my plan is to kind of shift everything

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.820 
my plan is to kind of shift everything
over<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:14.150> drop<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> beds<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
over here drop one of the beds in and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.899 
over here drop one of the beds in and
take<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> dirt<00:01:17.820> put<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.380> then

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
take the dirt put it in there and then

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
take the dirt put it in there and then
put<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:21.060> bed<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.189> redo<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.580> know

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
put the other bed and and redo you know

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.120 
put the other bed and and redo you know
half<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> dirt<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.560> into<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
half the dirt into into that one so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.530 
half the dirt into into that one so
obviously<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.640> won't<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:26.909> enough<00:01:27.090> dirt<00:01:27.270> for

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
obviously this won't be enough dirt for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
obviously this won't be enough dirt for
for<00:01:28.020> both<00:01:28.140> beds<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> should<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
for both beds but it should you know it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
for both beds but it should you know it
should<00:01:30.180> work<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> meantime<00:01:30.900> morning<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
should work for the meantime morning you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.370 
should work for the meantime morning you

I<00:03:07.080> had<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.740> used<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.160> doing<00:03:08.940> some<00:03:09.300> other

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
I had not used for doing some other

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.470 
I had not used for doing some other
random<00:03:09.690> planning<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.740> regular<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:12.120> regular

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
random planning of regular of regular

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.270 
random planning of regular of regular
plants<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:12.930> yeah<00:03:13.050> but<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.920> jungle

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
plants but yeah but this is the jungle

growth<00:03:14.430> stuff<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.209> lows<00:03:15.600> only

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
growth stuff I think this is lows only

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.960 
growth stuff I think this is lows only
maybe<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.580> The<00:03:17.730> Miracle

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
maybe but it's kind of like The Miracle

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.060 
maybe but it's kind of like The Miracle
Gro<00:03:18.300> moisture<00:03:19.170> control<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.650> used<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
Gro moisture control that I used in a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.530 
Gro moisture control that I used in a
lot<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.430> other<00:03:20.580> beds<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> little

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
lot of the other beds and so a little

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.360

less<00:03:21.720> expensive<00:03:22.200> too<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.590> seemed<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.220> work

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
less expensive too and seemed to work

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
less expensive too and seemed to work
awesome<00:03:23.850> as<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.030> had<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.630> these<00:03:25.019> two<00:03:25.230> beds

it's<00:04:27.870> already<00:04:28.050> there<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.470> add<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.890> fourth<00:04:29.220> and

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
it's already there and add a fourth and

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.310 
it's already there and add a fourth and
so<00:04:29.760> that's<00:04:29.970> probably<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.630> last<00:04:30.900> little<00:04:31.200> bit

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
so that's probably the last little bit

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.670 
so that's probably the last little bit
of<00:04:31.350> stuff<00:04:31.620> i'll<00:04:31.770> have<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.160> have<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.330> do<00:04:33.480> i<00:04:33.690> did

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
of stuff i'll have to have to do i did

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.950 
of stuff i'll have to have to do i did
put<00:04:34.890> stakes<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.910> see<00:04:36.120> what<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.900> would

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
put stakes and just to see what it would

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.200 
put stakes and just to see what it would
be<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.800> add<00:04:38.190> an<00:04:38.370> additional<00:04:38.760> bit<00:04:38.940> last

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
be like to add an additional bit last

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.810 
be like to add an additional bit last
year<00:04:39.390> was<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:40.080> about<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.380> right<00:04:40.680> amount<00:04:40.820> of

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
year was just about the right amount of

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.220 
year was just about the right amount of
stuff<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.240> grow<00:04:42.420> especially<00:04:42.540> since<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
stuff to grow especially since the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.170 
stuff to grow especially since the
tomatoes<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:43.860> bed<00:04:44.040> didn't<00:04:44.730> do<00:04:44.850> very<00:04:44.880> well

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
tomatoes in this bed didn't do very well

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.880 
tomatoes in this bed didn't do very well
and<00:04:45.600> i'm<00:04:45.720> only<00:04:45.810> going<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.170> try<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.470> put<00:04:46.650> stuff

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
and i'm only going to try and put stuff

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.980 
and i'm only going to try and put stuff
that<00:04:47.040> that<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.640> know<00:04:47.700> grows<00:04:48.060> really<00:04:48.630> well<00:04:48.720> in

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
that that you know grows really well in

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.230 
that that you know grows really well in
my<00:04:49.080> experience<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.890> so<00:04:50.100> i<00:04:50.130> should<00:04:50.640> have<00:04:50.910> about

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
my experience and so i should have about

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.700 
my experience and so i should have about
as<00:04:51.390> much<00:04:51.540> as<00:04:51.690> i<00:04:51.780> need<00:04:51.810> one<00:04:52.020> more<00:04:52.350> bed<00:04:52.560> i<00:04:52.590> don't

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
as much as i need one more bed i don't

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.110 
as much as i need one more bed i don't
know<00:04:52.920> if<00:04:53.070> i'll<00:04:53.190> add<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.400> or<00:04:53.640> not<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.910> would<00:04:54.000> be

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
know if i'll add it or not it would be

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.510 
know if i'll add it or not it would be
about<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.330> 2<00:04:54.570> by<00:04:54.690> 6<00:04:54.860> even<00:04:55.860> though<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.070> bets<00:04:56.280> to

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
about a 2 by 6 even though that bets to

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.790 
about a 2 by 6 even though that bets to
buy<00:04:56.640> eight<00:04:56.850> but<00:04:57.480> if<00:04:57.780> it's<00:04:57.960> two<00:04:58.080> by<00:04:58.230> six<00:04:58.470> or<00:04:58.590> give

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
buy eight but if it's two by six or give

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.200 
buy eight but if it's two by six or give
me<00:04:58.890> plenty<00:04:59.070> of<00:04:59.190> room<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.370> still<00:04:59.700> walk<00:04:59.910> through

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
me plenty of room to still walk through

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.270 
me plenty of room to still walk through
here<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.660> not<00:05:01.140> take<00:05:01.380> up<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:01.800> know<00:05:01.830> tons<00:05:02.160> of

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
here and not take up I you know tons of

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.680 
here and not take up I you know tons of
space<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.580> then<00:05:02.670> we<00:05:02.790> may<00:05:02.940> take<00:05:03.150> mulch<00:05:03.450> from

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
space and then we may take mulch from

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.930 
space and then we may take mulch from
what<00:05:03.870> we<00:05:03.990> finish<00:05:04.350> just<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> regular<00:05:05.700> kind<00:05:05.820> of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
what we finish just the regular kind of

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.190 
what we finish just the regular kind of
flowers<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.450> stuff<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:06.630> will<00:05:06.870> put<00:05:07.080> in

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
flowers and stuff that will put in

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.290 
flowers and stuff that will put in
hopefully<00:05:08.190> hopefully<00:05:08.730> this<00:05:09.030> year<00:05:09.150> we'll<00:05:09.240> get

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
hopefully hopefully this year we'll get

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.550 
hopefully hopefully this year we'll get
that<00:05:09.420> done<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.780> then<00:05:09.870> take<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.140> mulch<00:05:10.320> out

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
that done and then take the mulch out

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.500 
that done and then take the mulch out
and<00:05:10.770> then<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.550> i'll<00:05:11.670> put<00:05:11.790> weed<00:05:11.970> barrier<00:05:12.210> all

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
and then so i'll put weed barrier all

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.440 
and then so i'll put weed barrier all
down<00:05:13.110> here<00:05:13.410> either<00:05:13.950> lay<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> bed<00:05:14.550> or<00:05:14.820> maybe<00:05:15.240> not

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
down here either lay a bed or maybe not

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.990 
down here either lay a bed or maybe not
lay<00:05:15.690> a<00:05:15.720> bed<00:05:16.010> we'll<00:05:17.010> see<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.460> then<00:05:17.610> maybe<00:05:17.730> take

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
lay a bed we'll see and then maybe take

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.670 
lay a bed we'll see and then maybe take
mulch<00:05:18.240> all<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.930> way<00:05:19.020> down<00:05:19.200> in<00:05:19.350> front<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:19.590> these

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
mulch all the way down in front of these

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.800 
mulch all the way down in front of these
beds<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.340> down<00:05:21.150> there<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.450> leave<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.690> rest

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
beds and down there and leave the rest

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.890 
beds and down there and leave the rest
of<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.080> yard<00:05:22.820> open<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.030> always<00:05:24.210> say<00:05:24.450> not

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
of the yard open so you always say not

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.150 
of the yard open so you always say not
going<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.110> put<00:05:25.230> in<00:05:25.320> any<00:05:25.500> more<00:05:25.680> beds<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:26.130> I

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
going to put in any more beds and I

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.680 
going to put in any more beds and I
guess<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.400> kind<00:05:26.670> of<00:05:26.760> did<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.030> already<00:05:27.210> even

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
guess I kind of did that already even

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.240 
guess I kind of did that already even
though<00:05:27.750> I'm<00:05:27.840> using<00:05:27.930> about<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.800> same<00:05:29.010> square

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
though I'm using about the same square

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.610 
though I'm using about the same square
footage<00:05:29.480> took<00:05:30.480> a<00:05:30.570> four<00:05:30.780> by<00:05:30.900> six<00:05:31.170> bed<00:05:31.380> and

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
footage took a four by six bed and

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.020 
footage took a four by six bed and
turned<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.250> into<00:05:32.510> two<00:05:33.510> three<00:05:34.140> by<00:05:34.830> sixes<00:05:35.700> so

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
turned it into two three by sixes so

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.360 
turned it into two three by sixes so
whatever<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:37.170> think<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.470> did<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.830> math<00:05:37.890> earlier

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
whatever I think I did the math earlier

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.860 
whatever I think I did the math earlier
whatever<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.000> do<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.210> math<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.510> can't<00:05:39.720> figure

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
whatever you do the math I can't figure

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.200 
whatever you do the math I can't figure
it<00:05:39.960> out<00:05:40.050> right<00:05:40.170> now<00:05:40.350> so<00:05:40.620> anyways<00:05:41.550> that's<00:05:41.910> it

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
it out right now so anyways that's it

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.720 
it out right now so anyways that's it
won't<00:05:43.050> be<00:05:43.170> doing<00:05:43.320> anything<00:05:43.650> else<00:05:43.980> plant<00:05:44.550> wise

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
won't be doing anything else plant wise

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.490 
won't be doing anything else plant wise
for<00:05:45.120> again<00:05:45.420> another<00:05:45.660> six<00:05:45.960> weeks<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.290> we'll

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
for again another six weeks so we'll

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.020 
for again another six weeks so we'll
just<00:05:46.560> kind<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:46.830> wait<00:05:46.980> and<00:05:47.070> see<00:05:47.250> but<00:05:47.430> this<00:05:47.850> was

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
just kind of wait and see but this was

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.330 
just kind of wait and see but this was
fun<00:05:48.270> I'm<00:05:48.480> excited<00:05:48.780> hope<00:05:49.740> everyone<00:05:50.040> else<00:05:50.070> is

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
fun I'm excited hope everyone else is

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.650
