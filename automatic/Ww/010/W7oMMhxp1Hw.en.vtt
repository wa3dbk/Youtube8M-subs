instruments break into two kinds one is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.110 
instruments break into two kinds one is
what<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:25.470> call<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> remote<00:02:26.040> sensor<00:02:26.550> which

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
what we call a remote sensor which

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360 
what we call a remote sensor which
measures<00:02:27.200> things<00:02:28.200> far<00:02:28.500> away<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.130> another

measures things far away we have another
type<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.670> insert<00:02:30.120> we<00:02:30.240> call<00:02:30.450> an<00:02:30.750> in-situ

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
type of insert we call an in-situ

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.500 
type of insert we call an in-situ
instrument<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.310> measures<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.030> error

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
instrument and this measures the error

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.630 
instrument and this measures the error
that<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.500> aircraft<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:35.040> actually<00:02:35.370> flight

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that the aircraft is actually flight

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.000 
that the aircraft is actually flight
they<00:02:36.210> will<00:02:36.360> measure<00:02:36.630> particular<00:02:37.170> gases<00:02:37.590> like

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
they will measure particular gases like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.720 
they will measure particular gases like
ozone<00:02:38.580> water<00:02:40.130> nitrous<00:02:41.130> oxide<00:02:41.550> or<00:02:41.700> laughing

and<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.060> forth<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.570> other<00:02:45.690> thing<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.290> we're

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and so forth the other thing is we're

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.500 
and so forth the other thing is we're
very<00:02:46.800> interested<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.490> validation<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
very interested in validation of the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.140 
very interested in validation of the
aura<00:02:48.690> settle<00:02:49.140> your<00:02:49.830> satellite<00:02:50.490> measures

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
aura settle your satellite measures

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.080 
aura settle your satellite measures

ozone depleting gases and ozone the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
ozone depleting gases and ozone the
second<00:02:54.390> thing<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.660> does<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.990> orem<00:02:55.920> measures

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
second thing it does is orem measures

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.850 
second thing it does is orem measures

so<00:02:59.460> it's<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.150> validation<00:03:00.600> experiment<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.500> have

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
so it's a validation experiment you have

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.950 
so it's a validation experiment you have
to<00:03:01.770> make<00:03:02.040> sure<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.910> your<00:03:03.450> satellite

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
to make sure that your satellite

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.680 
to make sure that your satellite
instruments<00:03:04.350> are<00:03:05.070> still<00:03:05.490> measuring<00:03:05.910> what<00:03:06.540> you

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
instruments are still measuring what you

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.640 
instruments are still measuring what you
originally<00:03:06.990> intended<00:03:07.770> for<00:03:07.950> them<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.520> measure

to the computer programming of the
instrument<00:04:58.600> or<00:04:58.780> they<00:04:59.140> can<00:04:59.320> send<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.920> into<00:05:00.070> a

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
instrument or they can send it into a

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.850 
instrument or they can send it into a
different<00:05:00.580> sampling<00:05:00.940> mode<00:05:01.300> so<00:05:02.080> it's<00:05:02.560> really

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
different sampling mode so it's really

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.820 
different sampling mode so it's really
an<00:05:03.090> interactive<00:05:04.090> process<00:05:04.120> now<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.440> it's<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.620> new

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
an interactive process now so it's a new

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.070 
an interactive process now so it's a new
way<00:05:06.190> of<00:05:06.220> doing<00:05:06.520> science<00:05:07.090> when<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:07.990> are

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
way of doing science when we are

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.810 
way of doing science when we are
controlling<00:05:08.380> an<00:05:08.620> asset<00:05:08.920> bubble<00:05:09.160> hog<00:05:09.310> it's<00:05:09.700> a

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
controlling an asset bubble hog it's a

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.370 
controlling an asset bubble hog it's a
whole<00:05:10.030> different<00:05:10.180> challenge<00:05:10.870> it's<00:05:11.080> more<00:05:11.230> like

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
whole different challenge it's more like

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.500 
whole different challenge it's more like
being<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.830> cross<00:05:12.130> between<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.550> an<00:05:13.120> air<00:05:13.330> traffic

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
being a cross between a an air traffic

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.270 
being a cross between a an air traffic
controller<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.440> pilot<00:05:14.830> because<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.130> have

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
controller and a pilot because you have

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.520 
controller and a pilot because you have
this<00:05:15.400> bird's-eye<00:05:15.880> view<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.420> year<00:05:16.600> it's<00:05:17.410> a

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
this bird's-eye view of the year it's a

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.350 
this bird's-eye view of the year it's a
very<00:05:17.770> sort<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.190> disconnected<00:05:18.790> experience

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
very sort of a disconnected experience

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.600 
very sort of a disconnected experience
we<00:05:19.570> have<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.870> really<00:05:19.990> focus<00:05:20.500> on<00:05:20.890> where<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.490> is

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
we have to really focus on where it is

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.940 
we have to really focus on where it is
how<00:05:22.180> it's<00:05:22.360> going<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.570> react<00:05:22.840> when<00:05:23.590> I<00:05:23.650> give<00:05:23.860> it

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
how it's going to react when I give it

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.280 
how it's going to react when I give it
commands<00:05:24.430> told<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:24.970> was<00:05:25.090> going<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.360> take<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:25.930> a

commands told I was going to take is a

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.130 
commands told I was going to take is a

lot of the basic airmanship that the
hand-eye<00:05:29.500> coordination<00:05:29.980> is<00:05:30.280> it's<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.550> lot

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
hand-eye coordination is it's a lot

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.900 
hand-eye coordination is it's a lot

if you're an airplane pilot than to

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.000 
if you're an airplane pilot than to

but as I got more and more involved in
it<00:05:48.820> and<00:05:48.970> started<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.450> search<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:49.840> out<00:05:49.960> and

will be engaged as to what else we could

far<00:06:49.449> away<00:06:49.780> from<00:06:49.930> home<00:06:50.289> is<00:06:50.530> is<00:06:51.340> a<00:06:51.430> good<00:06:51.879> idea<00:06:52.020> can

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
far away from home is is a good idea can

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.499 
far away from home is is a good idea can
be<00:06:53.050> done<00:06:53.710> in<00:06:53.889> a<00:06:53.919> successful<00:06:54.400> way<00:06:54.669> I<00:06:55.090> really

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
be done in a successful way I really

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:57.360 
be done in a successful way I really
think<00:06:55.659> that<00:06:55.780> this<00:06:55.990> is<00:06:56.199> really<00:06:56.439> a<00:06:56.560> historic

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
think that this is really a historic

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.399 
think that this is really a historic
occasion<00:06:57.669> for<00:06:58.060> us<00:06:58.120> it's<00:06:58.780> because<00:06:59.110> we're<00:06:59.289> on

00:06:59.399 --> 00:06:59.409 
occasion for us it's because we're on

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:02.339 
occasion for us it's because we're on
the<00:06:59.500> cusp<00:06:59.770> of<00:07:00.129> something<00:07:00.789> new<00:07:01.169> we're<00:07:02.169> on<00:07:02.259> the

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
the cusp of something new we're on the

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.360 
the cusp of something new we're on the
cusp<00:07:02.590> of<00:07:02.889> using<00:07:03.460> a<00:07:03.639> plane<00:07:04.090> that's<00:07:05.250> basically<00:07:06.250> a

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
cusp of using a plane that's basically a

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.550 
cusp of using a plane that's basically a
satellite<00:07:06.879> as<00:07:07.060> well<00:07:07.240> as<00:07:07.389> a<00:07:07.419> plan<00:07:07.780> we<00:07:08.349> can

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
satellite as well as a plan we can

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.529 
satellite as well as a plan we can
venture<00:07:08.800> out<00:07:09.129> into<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.759> regions<00:07:10.150> where<00:07:10.300> a<00:07:10.360> lot

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
venture out into the regions where a lot

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:11.580 
venture out into the regions where a lot
of<00:07:10.569> the<00:07:10.689> weather<00:07:10.960> in<00:07:11.139> the<00:07:11.199> United<00:07:11.560> States

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
of the weather in the United States

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.390 
of the weather in the United States
forms<00:07:12.400> but<00:07:13.300> is<00:07:13.479> so<00:07:13.689> remote<00:07:14.050> from<00:07:14.110> us<00:07:14.650> that<00:07:15.279> we

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
forms but is so remote from us that we

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.429 
forms but is so remote from us that we
can't<00:07:15.669> get<00:07:15.819> to<00:07:16.029> it<00:07:16.060> and<00:07:16.419> so<00:07:16.719> that<00:07:16.960> information

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439 
can't get to it and so that information

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.499 
can't get to it and so that information
is<00:07:18.099> now<00:07:18.219> going<00:07:18.460> to<00:07:18.550> be<00:07:18.639> used<00:07:19.060> to<00:07:19.270> improve

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:19.509 
is now going to be used to improve

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:22.619 
is now going to be used to improve
forecast<00:07:20.139> will<00:07:20.800> be<00:07:21.039> used<00:07:21.460> to<00:07:21.879> improve<00:07:22.300> our

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:22.629 
forecast will be used to improve our

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.950 
forecast will be used to improve our
policies<00:07:23.319> towards<00:07:24.099> air<00:07:24.340> quality<00:07:25.180> and<00:07:25.599> climate

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
policies towards air quality and climate

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.230 
policies towards air quality and climate
change<00:07:26.439> and<00:07:26.770> ozone<00:07:27.189> depletion<00:07:27.639> it's<00:07:27.969> a<00:07:28.029> new

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 
change and ozone depletion it's a new

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.330 
change and ozone depletion it's a new
way<00:07:28.419> of<00:07:28.449> doing<00:07:28.960> things<00:07:29.139> for<00:07:29.529> us<00:07:29.680> and<00:07:30.039> I<00:07:30.310> think

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:30.340 
way of doing things for us and I think

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.429 
way of doing things for us and I think
that's<00:07:31.120> what<00:07:31.419> makes<00:07:31.629> you<00:07:31.779> think<00:07:31.810> that<00:07:32.080> we're

00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:32.439 
that's what makes you think that we're

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:35.029 
that's what makes you think that we're
really<00:07:32.860> doing<00:07:33.250> something<00:07:33.939> exciting<00:07:34.330> and<00:07:34.599> do

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 
really doing something exciting and do

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:47.900 
really doing something exciting and do
