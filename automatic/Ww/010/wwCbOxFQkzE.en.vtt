terminology for it but acting the day
what<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.420> screws<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.110> over

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
time for the most part the there's a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.740 
time for the most part the there's a
setting<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:53.250> give<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.119> computer

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
setting that will give the the computer

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.889 
setting that will give the the computer
a<00:01:55.049> full<00:01:55.950> advantage<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.640> turbo<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:57.540> stray

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
a full advantage like turbo or stray

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510 
a full advantage like turbo or stray
definitely<00:01:58.590> turn<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.829> stuff<00:01:59.070> off<00:01:59.250> I'll

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
definitely turn that stuff off I'll

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.530

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.920 
a freaking glitch man try to tackle that
guy<00:04:37.259> it's<00:04:37.470> not<00:04:37.590> even<00:04:37.770> fair<00:04:38.009> and<00:04:38.490> their<00:04:39.330> defense

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
guy it's not even fair and their defense

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.110 
guy it's not even fair and their defense
just<00:04:40.080> causes<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.770> many<00:04:40.860> fumbles<00:04:41.099> in<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.910> game

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
just causes so many fumbles in this game

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.629 
just causes so many fumbles in this game
so<00:04:42.389> fungals<00:04:42.780> is<00:04:42.900> definitely<00:04:43.259> a<00:04:43.289> problem<00:04:43.639> it's

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
so fungals is definitely a problem it's

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.029 
so fungals is definitely a problem it's
like<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.389> don't<00:04:45.720> understand<00:04:46.259> why<00:04:46.590> they<00:04:46.800> have<00:04:46.919> to

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
like I don't understand why they have to

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.620 
like I don't understand why they have to
have<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.310> many<00:04:47.460> fumbles<00:04:47.699> like<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.180> understand<00:04:48.569> i

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
have so many fumbles like I understand i

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.120 
have so many fumbles like I understand i
guess<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.900> makes<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.710> games<00:04:49.919> more

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
guess it makes the games more

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.700 
guess it makes the games more
entertaining<00:04:50.580> your<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.419> has<00:04:51.780> chances<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.590> make

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
entertaining your it has chances to make

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.309 
entertaining your it has chances to make
games<00:04:52.979> closer<00:04:53.340> toward<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.569> know<00:04:54.690> change<00:04:55.110> the

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
games closer toward you know change the

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.170

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
tide the tide or the momentum of the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.230
