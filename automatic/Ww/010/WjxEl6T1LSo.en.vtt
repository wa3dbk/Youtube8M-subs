00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.480
 let's practice a little bit of my car 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.529
 this is a mini cooper from austin in 1981 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.470
 this car was imported from england and 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.330
 here in Mexico we did the restoration 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.410
 I want to tell you that this restoration 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.940
 it was 100% the whole floor was rotten 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.820
 because then the area over there is 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.710
 you are sea and then it is rotten and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.190
 we changed it we did the whole vehicle 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.899
 new to see the part from here 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.079
 back to all 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.140
 completely they are new pieces and 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.100
 some imported and others are made to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.809
 hand the back table is handmade 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.570
 and what we try to do is a 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.019
 unique vehicle in mexico this vehicle 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.159
 is the only one that there are like 10 pickups in 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.170
 mexico but actually in this way the 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.369
 only the city councils have 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.470
 I put you are the best have discs of 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:14.119
 brake disc brakes has a 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.759
 new electrical wiring system all 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.729
 or is it a practical new car what 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.470
 revisions is new we have a motor this 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.270
 since it happens to the camera is a 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.179
 supercharged 1,380 engine is that of the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.190
 very special engines is an engine 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.479
 original to not remove the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.010
 originality of the car is an engine 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.810
 original 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.060
 of the only thing you give yourself a horse 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.280
 greater are more or less as in 150 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.330
 horses 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.450
 imagine with a weight ratio of 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.400
 600 kilos this car flies flies 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.120
 materially for what it is to be able to 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.520
 clothes found much care to handle it 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.360
 what can i say the painting is a 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.330
 a special painting that we put 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.010
 the cricket what I do not want to say is that 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.480
 here in Mexico we make very good 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.170
 restorations there are very good 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.820
 restorers in mexico and this last 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 approximately 7 years not for the time 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.070
 which lasted but because there were many 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.840
 things to do and many pieces with 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.320
 We import all the pieces from 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.600
 england and the USA are many times not 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.840
 there was a little piece and behind it the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.000
 determined then this one was complex 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.100
 but finally we made a 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.340
 single truck we did not put a wood 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.340
 behind 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.730
 in some way the only thing that 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.370
 is not original let 's say this stage is 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.780
 but I put it on with the desire to take care 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.580
 the wood of the sun and the rain if not 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.580
 the car rots 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:03.379
 as such it is a vehicle moment for 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:06.610
 load milk were were vehicles for 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.610
 load at that time 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.340
 they loaded milk this is not milk 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.830
 well now do not load milk 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.300
 this is a vehicle more than 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.600
 I have it and we give him his death 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.120
 dating there is where some weekend 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.070
 but this is really a unique case 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.600
 everyone thinks we cut it 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:38.660
 that's not original there I have a band 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.820
 you have original are weird models inside 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.040
 of cooper that they will see it vital if 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.200
 they like it, they are are models 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.920
 those who are already going back 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.280
 she is also an avant 1965 austin also 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.590
 very special I tell you there are shots 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.470
 we brought all of us we care about this 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.830
 it's to that basic need he cares very 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.830
 well in europe 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.600
 it was yellow and the restoration was done 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:14.290
 in the USA, it does not matter 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.470
 and they were from the abraham republic four 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.420
 three or four are very scarce and the engine 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.200
 that brings is also one thousand three hundred 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.080
 thousand 380 with double carburetor per but if 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.600
 the engine is a little bit touched although it is 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.970
 original is not element is an engine of 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.060
 others and we original but if you bring a 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.070
 piston crankshaft ratio and everything 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.290
 handle it like a demon 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.290
 I think that the hardest this one 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.580
 is an original unique model is not capped 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.280
 it was not done like this they came out and also 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.870
 used at that time to load what 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.170
 more that it was the closed charge that did not 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.360
 could not get wet, much less 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.400
 They carry milk if nothing happened 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.500
 they used to put the load there since they 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.750
 that somehow he could not get wet 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.240
 but the most important thing about this 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.820
 I want to tell you that these cars take off 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.610
 a smile to forces I can tell you 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.160
 that where I stand is a child or adult 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.780
 Big all we will take you bags 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.610
 a smile is a car that takes out 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.860
 smiles for its size for its 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.480
 specialty then is a car that is 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.230
 a particular healthy because I have them 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.270
 they fascinate me 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.139
 I like them very much , it makes me a very car 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:44.249
 very nice 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:46.930
 Unique is an English like this 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.180
 but this is the truth because we are very 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.350
 I hope you're happy 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.880
 well in this event 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.630
 and here we are to serve you not when 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.630
 like our training
