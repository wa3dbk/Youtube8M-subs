00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
afterwards and he pretty much what I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.490 
afterwards and he pretty much what I
thought<00:03:00.020> killed<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.970> plant<00:03:02.540> because<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.290> just

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
thought killed the plant because it just

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.120 
thought killed the plant because it just
the<00:03:04.250> leaves<00:03:04.459> turned<00:03:04.850> almost<00:03:05.090> black<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.980> it
