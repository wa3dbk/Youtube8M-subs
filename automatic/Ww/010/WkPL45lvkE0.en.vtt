00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
sights on a Super Bowl is that something

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.219 
sights on a Super Bowl is that something
you<00:02:07.790> think<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.090> guys<00:02:08.300> can<00:02:08.539> accomplish<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.200> a

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
you think you guys can accomplish as a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.130 
you think you guys can accomplish as a
team<00:02:09.530> next<00:02:09.709> year<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.390> think<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.900> know<00:02:11.989> it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
team next year I think I you know it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.600 
team next year I think I you know it's
confidence<00:02:12.680> as<00:02:12.860> far<00:02:13.069> as<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.220> teams<00:02:13.459> concerned

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
confidence as far as the teams concerned

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.199 
confidence as far as the teams concerned
I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.390> our<00:02:14.540> team<00:02:14.720> has<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:14.959> lot<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.140> confidence

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
I think our team has a lot of confidence

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.370 
I think our team has a lot of confidence
you<00:02:17.209> know<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.480> were<00:02:17.630> going<00:02:17.900> with<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.080> rookie

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
you know we were going with a rookie

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.910 
you know we were going with a rookie
quarterback<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:20.440> thought<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.560> might<00:02:21.739> win

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
quarterback and I thought we might win

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.460 
quarterback and I thought we might win
them<00:02:22.069> all<00:02:22.130> with<00:02:22.400> job<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.090> know<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:23.569> we

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
them all with job you know so we

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.500 
them all with job you know so we
certainly<00:02:24.650> had<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> chance<00:02:25.220> if<00:02:25.519> shabb<00:02:26.300> would

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
certainly had a chance if shabb would

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.089 
certainly had a chance if shabb would
have<00:02:26.630> stayed<00:02:26.780> well<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.050> think<00:02:27.230> everybody<00:02:27.920> can

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
have stayed well I think everybody can

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.180 
have stayed well I think everybody can
agree<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.680> have<00:02:30.800> I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
agree to that so you know we have I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.430 
agree to that so you know we have I
think<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.819> have<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.970> strong<00:02:32.330> strong<00:02:32.870> team<00:02:33.230> right

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
think we have a strong strong team right

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.259 
think we have a strong strong team right
now<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.680> had<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.980> great<00:02:34.130> running<00:02:34.400> back<00:02:34.640> we've

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
now we had a great running back we've

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.699 
now we had a great running back we've
got<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> quarterback<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.049> really<00:02:36.260> big<00:02:36.500> time

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
got a quarterback it's a really big time

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.559 
got a quarterback it's a really big time
player<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.310> then<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.610> think<00:02:38.030> our<00:02:38.150> defense<00:02:38.269> is

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
player and then I think our defense is

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.690 
player and then I think our defense is
going<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.930> solid<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.950> rebuffed<00:02:40.370> an<00:02:40.519> offer

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
going to be solid you rebuffed an offer

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.550 
going to be solid you rebuffed an offer
from<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.150> Tampa<00:02:41.360> Bay<00:02:41.480> Buccaneers<00:02:41.840> was<00:02:42.410> that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was that

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.770 
from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was that
in<00:02:42.739> part<00:02:43.040> because<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.489> thought<00:02:43.700> we've<00:02:44.600> got

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
in part because you thought we've got

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.380 
in part because you thought we've got
such<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.110> good<00:02:45.230> situation<00:02:45.500> in<00:02:46.040> Houston<00:02:46.459> well

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
such a good situation in Houston well

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.210 
such a good situation in Houston well
poorly<00:02:47.720> because<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.260> Houston<00:02:48.680> yes<00:02:48.860> certainly

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
poorly because of Houston yes certainly

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.880 
poorly because of Houston yes certainly
where<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:49.910> am<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.959> point<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.319> my<00:02:51.350> career<00:02:51.470> and
