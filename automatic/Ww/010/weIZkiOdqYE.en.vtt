this is a makeup sponge applicator and
I'm<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.009> padding<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.579> over<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> stencil<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
I'm just padding at over the stencil I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.770 
I'm just padding at over the stencil I
don't<00:02:05.340> want<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> very<00:02:05.759> thick<00:02:06.090> layer<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
don't want a very thick layer just a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540 
don't want a very thick layer just a
real<00:02:06.960> light<00:02:07.140> layer<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.860> trying<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.250> cover

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
real light layer I'm not trying to cover

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.210 
real light layer I'm not trying to cover
the<00:02:08.729> entire<00:02:08.819> tag<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:09.989> bit<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the entire tag just a little bit in the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
the entire tag just a little bit in the
upper<00:02:11.520> left<00:02:11.760> corner<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:12.660> also<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
upper left corner and then also in that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.789 
upper left corner and then also in that
bottom<00:02:13.530> right<00:02:13.680> corner

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.319 

now<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.219> has<00:02:17.430> dried<00:02:17.819> i'm<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.239> to

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
now that that has dried i'm going to

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.059 
now that that has dried i'm going to
take<00:02:18.480> peanut<00:02:18.840> brittle<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.379> back<00:02:19.590> over<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
take peanut brittle and go back over the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.729 
take peanut brittle and go back over the
top<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:20.760> creates<00:02:21.329> um<00:02:21.599> almost<00:02:22.379> like<00:02:22.709> a

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
top and this creates um almost like a

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.589 
top and this creates um almost like a
tone-on-tone<00:02:23.040> look<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.939> the<00:02:24.060> stencil<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
tone-on-tone look with the stencil it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.789 
tone-on-tone look with the stencil it
kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.840> pushes<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.290> back<00:02:25.319> into<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
kind of pushes it back into the

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.949 
kind of pushes it back into the
background<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.670> pattern<00:02:27.150> isn't<00:02:27.659> too

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
background so the pattern isn't too

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.899 
background so the pattern isn't too
strong<00:02:28.319> when<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.680> layer<00:02:28.890> other<00:02:29.189> elements<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
strong when we layer other elements on

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.479 
strong when we layer other elements on
top<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:33.799> now<00:02:34.799> we're<00:02:34.980> ready<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.250> add

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
top of that and now we're ready to add

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.960 
top of that and now we're ready to add
some<00:02:36.030> color<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.299> our<00:02:36.480> die-cuts<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.439> is

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
some color to our die-cuts so this is

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.089 
some color to our die-cuts so this is
poinsettia<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.209> joyful<00:02:40.139> and<00:02:40.349> i<00:02:40.709> love<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
poinsettia is joyful and i love that it

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.399 
poinsettia is joyful and i love that it
cuts<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.329> petals<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.930> poinsettia

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
cuts the the petals of the poinsettia

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.899 
cuts the the petals of the poinsettia
separate<00:02:43.859> from<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.129> stem<00:02:44.370> makes<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.700> really

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
separate from the stem makes it really

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.030 
separate from the stem makes it really
easy<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.329> color<00:02:45.569> so<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.349> put<00:02:46.590> peanut<00:02:46.889> brittle

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
easy to color so I put peanut brittle

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.530 
easy to color so I put peanut brittle
there<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.549> center<00:02:47.939> and<00:02:47.970> now<00:02:48.359> i'm<00:02:48.480> taking

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
there in the center and now i'm taking

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.569 
there in the center and now i'm taking
ranger<00:02:49.379> archival<00:02:49.859> ink<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.189> the<00:02:50.280> color<00:02:50.489> of

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.430 

and<00:03:02.940> then<00:03:03.600> next<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.170> will<00:03:04.470> get<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:06.170> stem<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and then next we will get the stem and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.780 
and then next we will get the stem and
the<00:03:07.530> leaves<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:10.040> for<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.190> I'm<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.610> use
