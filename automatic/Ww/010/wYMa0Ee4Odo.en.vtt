00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:09.780
 Yes I am Hello everybody Well today 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:14.530
 Because I wore the question of calculation problems, I think that it is a view that it is a bit open to the public 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.570
 It's It is an old well a member of the problem was dead dark 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:23.430
 People say the right ground wing in Kuroko timers say 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:28.000
 I received a question that I do not know 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.660
 For example, Neen Miura 6 and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.520
 The right knitle is not the same 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.150
 This it has imposed this useless 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.010
 Oishi is also this 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:46.750
 So, for example, if it gets dark 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.140
 I can not say l 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.550
 You can't compare it to just taking a walk 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.040
 In in story Tteyuu by Ichiéœ€ is to appropriate it is there to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.000
 Speaking of weight 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.000
 Weight of water of 1 frum 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.210
 I was saying, I 1ml 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.240
 It is actually a singlet what Tsu Actually 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.480
 Let's say that 5 elbows are 1 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 For example, I 1ml Is 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.820
 That's why I got 1g 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.530
 It's the answer to this Semigurabu 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:30.030
 Do you understand 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:32.690
 If you throw in Nikki to say I problem, I guess that the wave is It is Well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.530
 Here is what number two 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.570
 If you throw take Nami 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.020
 Bibliogram on 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.140
 I'm telling you it's going to be dropped 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.310
 It is true now 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.900
 A thousand grams 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.550
 One or 1000mg a in the 500 meat 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.550
 I know other things 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.970
 And I said, Pamiri lock of brother regular at No. Shane and increase production there or go with Beuve 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.209
 Once is good 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 This is 1ml is it was good sense that I will lead the Board of good Miura for in light 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:20.140
 So to par 12 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 Diritto Rotosu and brother milligrams has been the notation think you have this you have the original 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.090
 Hey 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.720
 so 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.960
 Because Is Dene rice of Tteyuu this 22 g par Meet 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:36.310
 This is a lidocaine video parent in this battle 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:41.960
 Trying to decide not explains that the I mean said milligrams such to 1 mm Akari 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:48.290
 Even though it 's 2ml , the lead member is in the volume. 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.010
 Since I wish to Tsu'm entering I'm 2mg is 122 a 1 Miririttoru this 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.520
 Ne 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:59.090
 Give it a drop and it's 2mg 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.480
 I have to say I'll become that the goods tiles of well Karen itself went stopped basis year by that solved 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.130
 is not it 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.780
 Deje Hey, for example, hey Well 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.319
 It is the next problem though 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.430
 Yeah, I'm here 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.430
 I will go to the 3rd 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.150
 It is this 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.060
 Is Hmm, etc. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:32.159
 Split older brother Ripple 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:34.980
 It is 2 mg per minute that I say it is 2 milligruppa It is Mummy so 1 milli month 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:41.340
 That's 2 mg of gel 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.390
 If I say or do if I wanted to Japan I Yeah 2 Miribura army for one minute is 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.420
 8 I would like to do this 2mg 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.830
 To in 1ml 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.000
 Iizuka 2mg is not included in this drug 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.360
 2 mg drop table 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.410
 I'm There is not good if you drop have 1 mm 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.700
 Since 1 minute or say 1 minute is in this 2mg If you throw 21 mm answer to a 1 Miripa worth 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.420
 It will be 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.990
 To this formula is easy to see that Tai 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:19.389
 This I'd wanted to say that I Iemaru to Yo in 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:25.539
 It is an endoscope and it is probably to be useful to calculate beautifully 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:27.219
 One minute per milliliter I can't say such a big thing, so in Japan it's rational information 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.090
 Because it says so much 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:34.150
 If 1 person per 1 minute bread and 1 person 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.190
 It has become like the video that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.190
 Do you understand or yes
