00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.910 
be patient waiting it out and it should
work<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.690> doesn't<00:05:15.080> your<00:05:15.290> iPod<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.740> gonna

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
work if it doesn't your iPod is gonna

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.020 
work if it doesn't your iPod is gonna
look<00:05:16.040> like<00:05:16.100> this<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.700> you're<00:05:16.820> just<00:05:16.910> gonna

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
look like this and you're just gonna

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.520 
look like this and you're just gonna
need<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.240> black<00:05:17.450> screen<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.870> be<00:05:17.930> stuck<00:05:18.170> on<00:05:18.350> it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
need a black screen and be stuck on it

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.380 
need a black screen and be stuck on it
that<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.680> tried<00:05:18.920> this<00:05:19.070> twice<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:20.120> didn't

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
that I tried this twice and it didn't

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.270 
that I tried this twice and it didn't
work<00:05:20.510> so<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:21.290> thought<00:05:21.530> this<00:05:21.680> would<00:05:21.770> be<00:05:21.920> good<00:05:22.070> to

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
work so I thought this would be good to

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.370 
work so I thought this would be good to
throw<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.700> video<00:05:22.940> it<00:05:23.420> does<00:05:23.720> work<00:05:23.960> if<00:05:24.230> you

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
throw in the video it does work if you

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.470 
throw in the video it does work if you
don't<00:05:24.560> want<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.100> use<00:05:25.940> this<00:05:26.060> gel<00:05:26.300> already

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
don't want to use this gel already

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.970 
don't want to use this gel already
because<00:05:26.690> this<00:05:26.810> may<00:05:26.960> happen<00:05:27.200> or<00:05:27.590> if<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:27.860> have

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980
