have a couple of items from Urban
Outfitters<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.260> think<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.799> little

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
Outfitters I do think it can be a little

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.650 
Outfitters I do think it can be a little
bit<00:02:53.099> overpriced<00:02:53.459> sometimes<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.299> these<00:02:54.540> two

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
bit overpriced sometimes and these two

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.809 
bit overpriced sometimes and these two
items<00:02:54.810> were<00:02:55.200> kind<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.769> overpriced<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.670> what

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
items were kind of overpriced for what

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.130 
items were kind of overpriced for what
they<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.450> thought<00:02:57.690> I'd<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.079> it

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
they are but I thought I'd go for it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.809 
they are but I thought I'd go for it
anyway<00:02:58.379> because<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.340> often<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.579> I

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
anyway because it's not often that I

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.940 
anyway because it's not often that I
treat<00:03:00.060> myself<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.840> first<00:03:01.200> up<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.440> got<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.709> bra

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
treat myself so first up I got this bra

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.500 
treat myself so first up I got this bra
that<00:03:02.250> were<00:03:02.340> underneath<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.970> mesh<00:03:03.299> dress

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that were underneath this mesh dress

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.970 
that were underneath this mesh dress
because<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.140> thought<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.590> would<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.099> bit<00:03:05.430> less

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
because I thought it would be a bit less

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.080
