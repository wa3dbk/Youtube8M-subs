00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.580
 it may seem like a microwave 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.210

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.079
 220 network included 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:01.050

 this friend for smoke braces 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.059
 smoked by using here 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.600
 such here 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.240

 oak flavor and so on is very good 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.040
 briquette not on the shoulder of 48 or 120 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.320
 pieces well and the most important question for those 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.200
 who is going to smoke at home 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.150
 where do you go here 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.010
 special fitting on which puts on 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.260
 here is this corrugated tube and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.890
 accordingly , this one is only from which 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.190
 smoke comes out and and we are mounting either 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.040
 directing kitchen hood 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.200
 or we can just for the sake of smoking 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.270
 on the balcony put in the window and now 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.400
 look at the picture and behind means 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.380
 here it is just this fitting on which we 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.690
 we make a hose to smoke 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.000
 and there is another tray here 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.120
 water is poured here on this 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.540
 marks because when briquette smolders 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.790
 here are these hot damn when we need 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.650
 there we dispose of them clean and they 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.110
 get into the water tray that is to 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.230
 eliminate any possibility of hitting 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.300
 some kind of hot sect or hot suit 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 on some surface and all this is all 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.000
 made for complete safety when 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.280
 home smoked themselves burnt 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.700
 briquettes are removed with this one 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.660
 here's the grill rod when smoked 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.890
 their two pieces are 32 by 32 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.740
 centimeter well, that is quite a lot 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.980
 here you can put and you can 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.250
 at the same time smoking is permissible not only 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.850
 let's say one meat is possible and meat and lard and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.860
 chicken there chicken legs suppose to or 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.170
 thighs and home 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.940
 I think or even for a small cafe it 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.490
 comfortable and here's another one so nice 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.670
 little thing of course but it is very good round 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.070
 so sho there are such legs because when 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.980
 we pulled the product you need to put 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.810
 for it to cool just these 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.530
 legs allow you to put on some 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.220
 surface 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.820
 and that does not touch the product you need 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.820
 aging 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.550
 Well, as soon as possible 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.550
