00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.260
 the curtains are an integral part of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.449
 decor of a room but it is not 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.189
 always easy to navigate it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.199
 track on a pair of curtains ready to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.390
 ask and we're disappointed with the result a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 time back home 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.410
 little review of details about the good 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.980
 choice to make for her curtains while 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 first of all to what use do you intend them 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 protect from vis-Ã -vis filter the light 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
 of the day 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.719
 are they purely decorative or a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.940
 key element of the decor the curtains can 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.210
 play the transition between interior and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.789
 fast exterior mistelle will hide a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.690
 secret passage or create the atmosphere 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.860
 intimate even on a terrace 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.750
 notice the return of the curtains very 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.420
 classic interior style 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.390
 it highlights the volume of the room 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.070
 Attention, however, the proportions 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.729
 brave and suppose a great height 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 ceiling 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.650
 they can become the central element of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.090
 decor as here to frame the view 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.799
 outer 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.140
 I like the falsely bohemian side of 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.509
 Guild designers who shake up the codes 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.759
 and plays on similar patterns without 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.909
 to be identical between wallpaper and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.659
 curtains the continuit erases the markers 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.579
 and nurtures a sense of space for 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.560
 succeed this type of color contrast 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.259
 who laughs he nicely the room it takes 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.770
 all the talent of precia guild dared but 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.990
 very talented according to the finish of the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.719
 curtain head the facts and the atmosphere 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.700
 Flemish change and folds on the 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.280
 medium fabrics will give them a pretty 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.739
 to fall the smoke will go as well to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.810
 fine fabrics conveying while the 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.810
 flat folds will enhance the fabrics 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.369
 with broad patterns the waves like the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.929
 eyelets are perfect for 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.149
 heavy fabrics like braults where 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.299
 the velvet they will reveal 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.129
 changing shades book christmas 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.739
 for fine fabrics such as linen or 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:12.970
 Italy for a charming decoration 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.459
 country to ensure a nice fall 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.200
 made my email or relay opted for a 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.810
 longer length for an effect 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.280
 brittle on the ground or a grazing cut 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.630
 for a stringed few 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.650
 mistakes not to commit 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.450
 here the frame the window in cradle and 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.579
 totally breaks the harmony of the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.579
 window and ceiling height 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.650
 this room with the colors trenches the 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.290
 arabesques of the curtains are in total 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.569
 contradiction for this dining room 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.329
 the veiling does not showcase the bay 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.190
 glazed and would have supported being framed 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.080
 by two decorative panels to 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.000
 bright colors 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.370
 in this room on the contrary the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.940
 state contrast made accurate even more 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 the space the golden rods would have 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.470
 erased in the warm decor and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.900
 should have been placed below the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.490
 moldings to reveal the full height 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.650
 for me it is neither done nor to be done 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.800
 some last tips play the 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.000
 contrasts of colors and materials 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.770
 bet on opulence 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.400
 nothing is sadder because curtain without 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.110
 folds and if the decor is very present and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.810
 a clip an array of weapons 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.010
 used on curtains that will blend 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.290
 in the decor in intentions set the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.080
 trance close to the ceiling to play the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.580
 height and dare to spill over the walls 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.630
 to give an impression of spacing 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.090
 conti but the most important museum 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.320
 always on beautiful materials we do not 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.320
 will never tire of it
