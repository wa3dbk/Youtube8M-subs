00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello guys welcome back buonanno 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.429
 above all we are now officially 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 in 2013 and only one will already be a very year 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.859
 especially these are very interesting 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.340
 first six months where they will be found 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.689
 of atomic bombs with triple titles 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 I say four to five of the stuff of the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 crazy scodellaro robot this month of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.020
 January and you know well could start 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 better, however, there are already some exits 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.860
 interesting and unfortunately a bad one 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.260
 news that I will explain to you at the end 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 anyway 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.269
 let's start with a double in January 11th 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 exit ps3 xbox ie 60 exit anarchy 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.729
 reigns new patron games game is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.789
 already released in Japan 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.049
 months and months ago labor also found 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.879
 an unboxing of our channel 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:06.060
 disconnection or of our mythical 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.310
 mirko matt since then i got to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
 talk to those who offer it from the point 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.940
 the Japanese version that speaks of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 Indian life so if you don't want to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.799
 wait for the neck part but here we are 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 almost 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.440
 they did not remain particularly 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 satisfied indeed they also had quite a lot 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.390
 bitter in the mouth so I recommend 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.280
 maybe I try I got it because it's a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.539
 game a bit special not for all 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.880
 palates always in eleven for wii u ninja 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.530
 gaiden 3 then goes the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.939
 remake a little will direct while 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.049
 also lands on wii u 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.689
 we also hope when it cannot improve 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.560
 the versions released a few months ago for 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.409
 ps3 xbox 60 because even those 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.659
 a little earlier for maxima then anarchy 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.500
 reigns left something to be desired 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.729
 which we hope will prove yours 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.979
 value 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.789
 we make 15 successful Saturdays 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.420
 very interesting dmc devil may cry 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:09.970
 double exit for 60 ps3 militia leader 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.769
 very well let's hope it doesn't do shit 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.060
 because in any case the brand of devil may 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:19.090
 cry is a solid brand despite how much 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.480
 I'm concerned the episode came out a few 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.739
 year ago on those three and the past 60 years 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.200
 you don't really have a picture with 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.890
 disdain or not against engines of 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 try the demo but the opinions are all 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.489
 rather concordant than positive 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.680
 so i hope the version too 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.840
 final of the game is then actually 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.709
 valid 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.239
 on the 15th of the same day takes the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.980
 favorite genre 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.690
 the first person shooters I don't 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.050
 I could live without his kind of 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.010
 you play fuck i see you give a damn thing though ve 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.519
 I say the same two double exits that 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.260
 something will be between ps3 or me not 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.840
 they just go down when I say it 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.140
 because as usual in fact then there 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 they are many snipers and more shooters 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.220
 but the more you put it, however, know that they do 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.709
 fold on 24 January 24 should 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.250
 get out of flight cotton because everything is not 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.370
 more quality ash comes out 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.790
 ninokuni will finally also be in Europe 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.700
 this coast is this adventure 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.650
 game that promises to be truly epic 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.239
 in standard version and in luisa version 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.540
 the vision beautiful box set 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.370
 containing the book in various spells 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.190
 spells and the more you put into it 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.889
 a plush of downloadable content 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.280
 how to say yes in short is a blast ad 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:47.079
 come out 24 very ready when I did the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.299
 ladder to make this video where 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:54.160
 eat if the top of the month is not 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:58.299
 news yesterday, that is, you today, the 9th 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.329
 January partner easy videos always the 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:05.390
 time is following but therefore loses and lo 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:08.120
 say unfortunately the January 8th that 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.400
 precisely European distributors have 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.420
 due to logistical issues it is not 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.310
 got it right 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.200
 fuck is it anyway the game will be released on the 1st 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.709
 February we'll talk about again in the month 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.590
 next one 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.299
 but a little that I say and spur more 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.290
 ruined the evening because I last night 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.940
 this news is ruined for the inter 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.770
 business to do 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.419
 among other things I have yellow we are the ditch 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.730
 opposite is around 100 euros do it 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.610
 if network then buy it back from put 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.860
 part a little bit of pennies 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.470
 we close this month in the room 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.740
 weak now they say recent by nietzsche 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.010
 you could not have cry and with marvel avengers 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.560
 the game for wii u mark it because it 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.900
 I find a new world but 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.600
 just all this stuff not 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.580
 I feel particularly interesting 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.530
 deliver to the same but the story 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.440
 or on the shelf that I don't have so much 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.780
 it is slight with regard to the 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.000
 the world of porters does not give a fuck 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.140
 as for the import I don't have 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.210
 noticed nothing particularly 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.830
 interesting or maybe I'm not 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.870
 shrewd reading the various titles 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.229
 Japanese on the internet so have 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.840
 have pity so I repeat this 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:24.410
 rather, parties and hackers devil may 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.990
 cry waiting or February with wine cones 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.020
 and went out to see together between 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.000
 a few days are still a happy new year 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.390
 all continue to follow on iris 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.650
 collection tv and soon has a hug 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.650
