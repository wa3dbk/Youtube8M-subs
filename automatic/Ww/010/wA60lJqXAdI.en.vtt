but I thought I would show you how how
it<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:18.000> works<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.000> last<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.650> need

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
it actually works and last off you need

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.310 
it actually works and last off you need
to<00:01:23.000> throw<00:01:24.000> some<00:01:24.210> concussion<00:01:24.780> grenades<00:01:25.140> at

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to throw some concussion grenades at

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
to throw some concussion grenades at
someone<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:29.090> so
