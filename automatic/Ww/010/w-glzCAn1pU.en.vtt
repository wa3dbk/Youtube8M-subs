00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 the beginning of a new season is always 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.019
 a very breathtaking experience 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 but this year I miss the words of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.320
 write how much we have learned park 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.300
 in a short time it is a drawing is one 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.900
 very young car is a rule 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.470
 very young so also wherever you are 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.500
 look you find festivities every runway in 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.530
 bahrein a little different background for example 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 it's the worst track on the tires 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.330
 posterior end instead it is the opposite 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.540
 even worse must you have 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.810
 a quote machine in all conditions 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 machines need to be developed for 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 be strong at every track so when 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 there is talk of a 14 t performance in China 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 or in bahrain 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 we are not discussing the same machine 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.600
 because we have improved 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.020
 this machine between bahrain and blind in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 China is something we must continue 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.650
 to do for all all year if 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.119
 we can manage these in development 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.160
 genus is not strong of the slopes 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.650
 or weak for the car and the machine 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.840
 becomes the strongest in every race and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.250
 this is our intention is the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 our hope 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.660
 our pilots are a part of these 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.320
 teams and we are very very lucky to 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.380
 have two of these cluster pilots 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.280
 ability ability with fernando we have 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.430
 seen as always a level of 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.940
 performance is extraordinary took 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.910
 every opportunity took this year 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.519
 every point available for this 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.700
 we must say thank you but we must say 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.910
 thanks also kg because he is working in 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.959
 very very cohesive way with the team 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 is working very well with the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.130
 team also with con fernando and ha 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.640
 proven time and time again that it is a 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.750
 first row driver then soon 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 we will also see the results from the limit 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.180
 meanwhile we are continuing to 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.190
 go together on the track with a team 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 strong 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.440
 the most brave riders of the grid 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.739
 for driving techniques we mean the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.739
 check that the pilot on the car 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.390
 a formula 1 is very strict for 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.360
 make the most of the load e 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.910
 dynamic load makes the driver brake in 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.830
 an abnormal way if going very strong 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.050
 in the initial part when the formula 1 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.120
 it is at maximum speed and at maximum 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.810
 load and just the car while in the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.850
 curve the pilot must dose the brake e 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.220
 decrease the train braking pressure 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.400
 only one meter later it already changes 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.920
 a lot in the lap time and there are 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.730
 two types of driving a guide much more 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.230
 clean 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.540
 these pilots who move the steering wheel in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.790
 a very sweet and if not a lot way 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.340
 sweets with the gas supply oi 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.920
 much more adhesive riders who are a lot 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.780
 abrupt with the movement of the steering wheel e 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.930
 even with gas they have a type or guide 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.280
 no to have a lot of grip on one 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.760
 formula 1 that sometimes even the over but 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.489
 I drink it 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.290
 and when the pilot is braking and also 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.239
 before leaving the brake is already 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 going on the gas to get out the fastest 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.660
 possible over-steer curve 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.090
 happens when the front of the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.700
 machine turns too much towards the curb 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.700
 and the pilot to correct must do the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.289
 counter steering the understeer occurs 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.870
 when the front turns to the outside 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.720
 of the curve to correct it you can 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.550
 do two things by raising the gas foot 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.820
 today give more the steering wheel the best 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.280
 riders must be very instinctive but 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.380
 also very smart using all 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.870
 data analysis to improve his 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.729
 driving technique in overtaking 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.310
 instinctive experts play a role 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.500
 fundamental but this year with new ones 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.070
 poor uni tenico guides are 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.070
 change again
