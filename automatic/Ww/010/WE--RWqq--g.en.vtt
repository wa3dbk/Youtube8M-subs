 Tereshchenko and the project surgeon today in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.070
 continuation of the editing topic 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 photos will be about one more 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.420
 the reason why users are so 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 love adobe photoshop lightroom presets 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 let's start the squat as you can understand from 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 the name is a series 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 preset new settings 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.330
 images which you can instantly 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.460
 apply to any photo that is very 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 saves time when processing large 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.380
 number of frames for a beginner 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.570
 Preset Photographer Real Find 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.030
 but don't get too carried away 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.520
 after all, excessive post-processing is not capable 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 only improve but spoil the original one 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.559
 shot in adobe lightroom window work with 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379
 Presets located in the morons section 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.079

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 makes life easier for beginners 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 photographer and lets deal with 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.650
 patterns of operation of the sliders and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.750
 image processing helping to grasp into 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.450
 the very essence of the process is the most useful 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.060
 built-in presets for me 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 located points lightroom bmw 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 preset and light umkalor squat first 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.270
 such as bmw mp2 bow 3 help make 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.850
 image more expressive and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.310
 dramatic translating it to black white and 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.040
 adding contrast second such as 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.590
 blood process and emphasis allow you to do 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.829
 photo more saturated and dynamic 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.229
 and presets colton and bleach bypass the opposite 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.990
 mutes the colors in the picture 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.950
 presets are not special 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.540
 functional as add 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.200
 the image has simple effects like 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.760
 Do not place the rounded edges of the field 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.100
 vignetting automatically align 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.330
 contrast or tints black and white 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.759
 old photo 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.710
 nevertheless i'm sure some 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.860
 users will appreciate such options 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.620
 processing the early videos I mentioned 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.160
 Presets are not used in the develop section. 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.600
 on point quick develop gp libre 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.820
 number of integrated presets 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.980
 rather poorly represented because 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.530
 just two options black and white 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.410
 Pictures are two kinds of cold tones and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.690
 two versions of the cross process of course to 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.240
 video can be applied and photographic 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.370
 presets but unfortunately in that case 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.670
 all settings will be lost except 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.010
 color hue and temperature exposure 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.410
 a much greater interest in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.300
 yourself the ability to download huge 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.970
 the number of presets in the open spaces 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.860
 Internet mostly they are paid 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.450
 as provided by different 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.670
 renowned photographers 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.100
 but if you look carefully you always 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.070
 find free options 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.080
 so you downloaded the presets 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.570
 but how do you put them in the base now 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.480
 data lightroom and for this you need 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.880
 right mouse hitting and usa squat 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.820
 now you should click on the caption 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.470
 import and in the window that opens, find the necessary 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.650
 files in resolution l 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.690
 Artem plate select them and click open 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.489
 now presets are added to memory 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.510
 lightroom and fully prepared for 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 use 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.620
 if you have already played enough 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.989
 sliders tinting and wanted 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.480
 save the result with the goal 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.730
 applying on other images you 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.370
 You can click on the plus sign in the columns 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.350
 squat so you create a new one 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.330
 squat which will unite in itself 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.090
 selected settings applied to 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.190
 white balance setting tanos processing 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.060
 color adjustment adjustments 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.560
 optics and other effects most beneficial 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.410
 I would call using this chip 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 white balance adjustment 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.640
 exposure or other parameters on 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.690
 a large number of shots if 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.280
 you are mistaken but 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.830
 threes on camera and shooting 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.620
 produced with static lighting 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.160
 Here is the next issue of monokrome approached 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.740
