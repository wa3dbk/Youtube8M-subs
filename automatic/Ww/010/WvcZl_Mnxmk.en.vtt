00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 or the people in the school that we're going to 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.360
 explain how it improves from our 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 gifted games as we see here I have 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.830
 installed two files two programs that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.320
 it's gay theme fire and jet2 the gateway is a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.650
 program that allows us to improve 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.410
 very much our look because it's going to 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.380
 suspend all the tasks of the cpu and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.850
 It will allow full control of the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.830
 computer or cpu for its development 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.990
 as we see here we are putting turn of 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.080
 the game for the system to pay 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.540
 all couples that are not necessary 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:02.250
 then as we saw here in the game fire 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:05.580
 it leaves us a lot cpu use memory 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.520
 from the ram the disk system and me 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.299
 I have a virtual memory installed 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 then let's see what is very good 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.370
 boosted the cpu to make it a lot 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.610
 less 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.260
 to improve the record, I have the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.190
 installed time in this except in 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.010
 this computer the jet box when 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.580
 is that they have followed the df he is going to 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.490
 boost much more much more because 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.500
 disable updates issues or 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.900
 any other type of connection and it 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.540
 center only in the game then 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.030
 can we start 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.659
 another guy when we're gifted 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.560
 let's go to 1 of steve 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.560
 let's go from here 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.420
 we wait a moment to load you 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.790
 remember famous is well not in endowment and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.899
 let's write write a code to 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.379
 that the game is stronger then 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.660
 let's go here we give right click we are going to 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.640
 properties in gifted 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.330
 and here in establishing options for 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.940
 launching 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:28.340
 we click and we will write the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.840
 word script height and we put it ok that 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.180
 means we're going to do with dio 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.670
 height we are going to give that the priority of 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.580
 cpu be the game 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.819
 well that's all for today I hope your 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.819
 the improvement in your game will be better bye bye
