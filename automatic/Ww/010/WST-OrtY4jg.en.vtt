I<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.710> whether<00:00:16.760> you're<00:00:17.760> looking<00:00:18.000> at

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I think that whether you're looking at

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.099 
I think that whether you're looking at
it<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> theological<00:00:18.869> perspective<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
it from a theological perspective or a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.830 
it from a theological perspective or a
scientific<00:00:22.109> perspective<00:00:23.660> answering<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
scientific perspective answering that

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.130 
scientific perspective answering that
question<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.830> specificity<00:00:27.859> you<00:00:28.859> know<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
question with specificity you know is is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.620 
question with specificity you know is is
above<00:00:31.140> my<00:00:31.320> pay<00:00:31.500> grade<00:00:31.910> I'm<00:00:32.910> guessing<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
address this from a few angles first of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
address this from a few angles first of
all<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.079> disagree<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> knowing<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.520> life

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.270 
Warren asked was when the rights to life
begin<00:01:05.360> for<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.500> clear<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> right

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
begin for me it is clear that the right

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
begin for me it is clear that the right
to<00:01:08.460> life<00:01:08.640> begins<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.240> soon<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.540> life<00:01:09.750> begins

representer<00:01:36.810> its<00:01:36.930> own<00:01:37.049> kind<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> cow<00:01:38.430> will

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
representer its own kind so a cow will

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999

human a human we also know the unborn

human a human we also know the unborn
are<00:01:44.460> alive<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.420> were<00:01:45.479> not

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
are alive because if they were not

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
are alive because if they were not
abortion<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.680> unnecessary<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.390> know

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
abortion would be unnecessary so we know

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
abortion would be unnecessary so we know
from<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.259> scientific<00:01:49.740> perspective<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:51.240> the

from a scientific perspective that the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.980 
from a scientific perspective that the
unborn<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.110> alive<00:01:52.590> human<00:01:53.340> beings<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.060> think

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
unborn are alive human beings I think

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.389 
unborn are alive human beings I think
that<00:01:55.110> president<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> our<00:01:55.860> country<00:01:56.130> should

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that president of our country should

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
that president of our country should
have<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.119> knowledge<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.229> consider

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
have this knowledge which I consider

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.260 
have this knowledge which I consider
basic<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.810> he<00:02:01.350> doesn't<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.640> President

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
basic but he doesn't know if President

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
basic but he doesn't know if President
Obama<00:02:03.360> by<00:02:04.170> his<00:02:04.350> own<00:02:04.560> admission<00:02:04.740> really

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
Obama by his own admission really

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.510 
Obama by his own admission really
doesn't<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.450> when<00:02:06.719> life<00:02:06.960> begins<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:08.069> why

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
doesn't know when life begins then why

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.510 
doesn't know when life begins then why
is<00:02:08.580> he<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.420> adamantly<00:02:10.170> supportive<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
is he so adamantly supportive of the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.170 
is he so adamantly supportive of the
abortion

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
abortion

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.690 
abortion
steh<00:02:12.299> to<00:02:12.510> shun<00:02:13.040> isn't<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.099> dangerous<00:02:14.430> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
steh to shun isn't it dangerous to
