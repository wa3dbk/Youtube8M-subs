the<00:00:15.490> oil<00:00:15.520> and<00:00:15.789> water<00:00:15.879> card<00:00:16.180> trick

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
the oil and water card trick

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.140 
the oil and water card trick
it<00:00:17.380> basically<00:00:17.529> uses<00:00:17.860> six<00:00:18.340> cards<00:00:18.670> three<00:00:18.880> red

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
it basically uses six cards three red

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.540 
it basically uses six cards three red
and<00:00:19.390> three<00:00:19.600> black<00:00:19.840> it<00:00:20.140> could<00:00:20.289> be<00:00:20.440> more<00:00:20.680> but<00:00:20.920> for

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
and three black it could be more but for

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.939 
and three black it could be more but for
this<00:00:21.609> particular<00:00:22.300> one<00:00:22.419> there's<00:00:22.630> only<00:00:22.750> six<00:00:23.050> and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
this particular one there's only six and

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.470 
this particular one there's only six and
red<00:00:24.310> cards<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.759> black<00:00:24.939> cards<00:00:25.269> each

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
red cards and black cards each

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.540 
red cards and black cards each
individually<00:00:26.259> represented<00:00:26.800> either<00:00:26.919> oil<00:00:27.310> or

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
individually represented either oil or

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.210 
individually represented either oil or
water<00:00:28.029> and<00:00:28.679> for<00:00:29.679> those<00:00:29.769> who<00:00:29.919> studied

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
water and for those who studied

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.950 
water and for those who studied
chemistry<00:00:30.550> or<00:00:30.880> as<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.119> matter<00:00:31.419> of<00:00:31.509> fact<00:00:31.689> if<00:00:31.839> you

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
chemistry or as a matter of fact if you

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.600 
chemistry or as a matter of fact if you
have<00:00:32.050> general<00:00:32.410> knowledge<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.950> this<00:00:33.130> you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
have general knowledge of this you

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.340 
have general knowledge of this you
should<00:00:33.640> know<00:00:34.030> that<00:00:34.180> all<00:00:34.420> does<00:00:34.780> not<00:00:34.930> mix<00:00:35.140> with

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
should know that all does not mix with

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.350 
should know that all does not mix with
water<00:00:35.530> because<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.670> different<00:00:37.000> densities

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
water because of the different densities

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.800 
water because of the different densities
it<00:00:37.750> works<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.050> same<00:00:38.110> with<00:00:38.380> cards<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.570> red

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
it works the same with cards if the red

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.110 
it works the same with cards if the red
is<00:00:40.990> mix<00:00:41.200> mix<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:41.980> black<00:00:42.190> they<00:00:42.730> don't<00:00:42.940> work

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
is mix mix to the black they don't work

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.110 
is mix mix to the black they don't work
okay<00:00:43.510> so<00:00:44.290> let's<00:00:44.890> try<00:00:45.070> let's<00:00:45.370> see<00:00:45.700> we<00:00:45.790> have<00:00:45.910> red

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
okay so let's try let's see we have red

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.690 
okay so let's try let's see we have red
black<00:00:46.390> so<00:00:47.050> we<00:00:47.080> place<00:00:47.410> individually<00:00:48.250> like<00:00:48.490> so

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
black so we place individually like so

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.230 
black so we place individually like so
red<00:00:49.240> black<00:00:49.480> red<00:00:49.750> black<00:00:49.930> red<00:00:50.800> black<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:52.000> that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
red black red black red black like that

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.330 
red black red black red black like that
and<00:00:52.780> we<00:00:52.900> square<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.350> up<00:00:53.560> so<00:00:53.860> it's<00:00:54.010> all<00:00:54.130> mixed

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
and we square it up so it's all mixed

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.820 
and we square it up so it's all mixed
and<00:00:54.670> if<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.330> snap<00:00:55.660> my<00:00:55.690> fingers<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.290> just<00:00:56.470> wait<00:00:56.800> a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
and if I snap my fingers and just wait a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.020 
and if I snap my fingers and just wait a
little<00:00:56.950> bit<00:00:57.930> um<00:00:59.130> they<00:01:00.130> actually<00:01:00.280> rearrange

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
little bit um they actually rearrange

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.600 
little bit um they actually rearrange
themselves<00:01:01.300> as<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.870> can<00:01:01.990> see<00:01:02.200> as<00:01:02.490> red<00:01:03.490> and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
themselves as you can see as red and

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.850 
themselves as you can see as red and
black<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:05.019> maybe<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.320> was<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:05.470> little<00:01:05.680> bit

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
black now maybe that was a little bit

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.280 
black now maybe that was a little bit
too<00:01:05.979> fast<00:01:06.189> for<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.549> so<00:01:06.820> I'll<00:01:07.810> do<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.049> again

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
too fast for you so I'll do it again

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.489 
too fast for you so I'll do it again
okay<00:01:08.590> we<00:01:09.040> have<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.250> blacks<00:01:09.520> over<00:01:09.820> here<00:01:11.259> and

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
okay we have the blacks over here and

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:14.219 
okay we have the blacks over here and
we'll<00:01:11.679> just<00:01:11.710> leave<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.219> red<00:01:12.429> just<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:12.999> so<00:01:13.359> so

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
we'll just leave the red just like so so

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.050 
we'll just leave the red just like so so
now<00:01:14.439> I'm<00:01:14.679> just<00:01:14.859> going<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.159> take<00:01:15.399> each<00:01:15.729> black

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
now I'm just going to take each black

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.139 
now I'm just going to take each black
card<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:17.100> place<00:01:18.100> them<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.490> between<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.999> red

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
card and place them in between the red

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.349 
card and place them in between the red
cards<00:01:19.450> just<00:01:19.539> like<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:19.899> very<00:01:20.140> clearly<00:01:20.469> as<00:01:21.359> you

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
cards just like so very clearly as you

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.239 
cards just like so very clearly as you
can<00:01:22.479> see<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:23.079> between<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.560> red<00:01:23.710> cards<00:01:24.069> and<00:01:24.189> if

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
can see in between the red cards and if

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:25.889 
can see in between the red cards and if
I<00:01:24.340> just<00:01:24.490> push<00:01:24.759> it<00:01:24.909> in<00:01:25.030> just<00:01:25.329> like<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:25.509> and

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
I just push it in just like so and

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.889 
I just push it in just like so and
square<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.999> if<00:01:27.999> I<00:01:28.090> snap<00:01:28.329> my<00:01:28.359> fingers<00:01:28.509> that

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
square and if I snap my fingers that

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.300 
square and if I snap my fingers that
wait<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.340> little<00:01:30.369> bit<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.710> actually<00:01:33.039> see

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
wait just a little bit you actually see

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.879 
wait just a little bit you actually see
that<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.329> red<00:01:34.479> cards<00:01:34.840> separate<00:01:35.560> from<00:01:35.710> black

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
that the red cards separate from black

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.760 
that the red cards separate from black
cards<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:37.479> all<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.899> water<00:01:38.139> once<00:01:38.499> again

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
cards because all the water once again

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.779 
cards because all the water once again
do<00:01:39.310> not<00:01:39.520> mix<00:01:40.829> okay<00:01:41.829> okay<00:01:42.130> maybe<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.609> was

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
do not mix okay okay maybe that was

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.370 
do not mix okay okay maybe that was
still<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.179> little<00:01:43.359> bit<00:01:43.569> too<00:01:43.630> fast<00:01:43.960> for<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.259> so

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
still a little bit too fast for you so

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.999 
still a little bit too fast for you so
I'm<00:01:44.469> going<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.679> try<00:01:44.829> it<00:01:44.889> again<00:01:46.469> this<00:01:47.469> time<00:01:47.530> I'll

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
I'm going to try it again this time I'll

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.919 
I'm going to try it again this time I'll
leave<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.459> blacks<00:01:48.789> on<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.240> table<00:01:49.600> just<00:01:49.749> like

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
leave the blacks on the table just like

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.870 
leave the blacks on the table just like
so<00:01:50.139> so<00:01:50.350> now<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.829> my<00:01:50.979> hand<00:01:51.219> there<00:01:51.520> are<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.729> red

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
so so now in my hand there are the red

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.910 
so so now in my hand there are the red
cards<00:01:52.409> okay<00:01:54.990> I'll<00:01:55.990> tell<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.289> what<00:01:56.439> let's

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
cards okay I'll tell you what let's
