00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.830 
you know as for me you know i'm sitting
here<00:01:54.780> playing<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.439> hour<00:01:56.130> by<00:01:56.399> hour<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:57.479> is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
here playing it hour by hour which is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
here playing it hour by hour which is
good<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.040> usually<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.610> get<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> dragon

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
good because usually you get the dragon

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.959 
good because usually you get the dragon
but<00:02:01.140> anyways<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.890> about<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.579> you're

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
but anyways that is about it if you're

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.580 
but anyways that is about it if you're
not<00:02:03.030> playing<00:02:03.390> an<00:02:03.570> hour<00:02:03.689> by<00:02:03.960> hour<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
not playing an hour by hour then you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
not playing an hour by hour then you
should<00:02:04.740> probably<00:02:04.890> start<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.149> this

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
should probably start just for this

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.050 
should probably start just for this
dragon<00:02:06.780> maybe<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.590> hour<00:02:07.799> by<00:02:07.950> hour<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.700> know

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
dragon maybe not hour by hour you know

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729 
dragon maybe not hour by hour you know
you<00:02:09.119> could<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.450> two<00:02:09.660> hours<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> time<00:02:10.410> or

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
you could do two hours at a time or

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
you could do two hours at a time or
maybe<00:02:10.920> three<00:02:11.310> hours<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
maybe three hours but the more the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
maybe three hours but the more the
closer<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
closer you do it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
closer you do it
the<00:02:14.190> higher<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.460> chance<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.660> this

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the higher the chance of you to get this

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.030
