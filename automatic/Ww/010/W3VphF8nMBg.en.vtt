than 160 stories today we're about four
hundred<00:02:52.599> ninety<00:02:52.780> meters<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:54.129> it's<00:02:54.610> sort<00:02:54.700> of

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
hundred ninety meters so it's sort of

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.880

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
over one third to go that could

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.650
