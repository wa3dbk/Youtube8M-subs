00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.700 

I'm<00:00:03.860> going<00:00:04.550> back<00:00:04.729> to<00:00:04.910> former<00:00:05.210> one<00:00:05.390> I<00:00:05.420> think<00:00:05.810> the

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
I'm going back to former one I think the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.010 
I'm going back to former one I think the
main<00:00:06.950> main<00:00:07.490> reason<00:00:07.970> was<00:00:08.180> that<00:00:08.209> I<00:00:08.480> never<00:00:08.690> really

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.020 
main main reason was that I never really

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.190 
main main reason was that I never really
lost<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.070> passion<00:00:10.280> in<00:00:10.690> inviting<00:00:11.690> him<00:00:12.019> for

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
lost the passion in inviting him for

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.259 
lost the passion in inviting him for
more<00:00:12.349> one<00:00:12.530> but<00:00:12.799> maybe<00:00:13.009> although<00:00:13.670> although<00:00:13.969> the

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
more one but maybe although although the

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.660 
more one but maybe although although the
things<00:00:14.480> around<00:00:14.780> it<00:00:15.019> but<00:00:15.200> when<00:00:16.160> I<00:00:16.279> did<00:00:16.460> some

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
things around it but when I did some

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.070 
things around it but when I did some
NASCAR<00:00:16.880> races<00:00:17.509> this<00:00:17.689> year<00:00:17.750> in<00:00:18.140> States<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:18.980> I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
NASCAR races this year in States and I

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.420 
NASCAR races this year in States and I
was<00:00:21.080> starting<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:21.410> miss<00:00:21.590> more<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.039> more<00:00:22.189> the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
was starting to miss more and more the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.790 
was starting to miss more and more the
racing<00:00:22.850> side<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.449> device<00:00:24.199> against<00:00:24.680> each

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
racing side the device against each

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.710 
racing side the device against each
other<00:00:25.039> because<00:00:25.430> in<00:00:25.580> a<00:00:25.670> rally<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.119> race

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
other because in a rally you race

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.980 
other because in a rally you race
against<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.080> clock<00:00:27.920> really<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:28.880> that's<00:00:29.750> what

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
against the clock really so that's what

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.100 
against the clock really so that's what
I'm<00:00:30.140> was<00:00:30.769> missing<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.429> then<00:00:31.609> all<00:00:32.360> really<00:00:32.900> I

the<00:01:53.490> tires<00:01:53.780> for<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:55.380> comparing<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> 2009<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the tires for for comparing to 2009 and

now coming coming to the next year the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.609 
now coming coming to the next year the
biggest<00:02:00.570> different<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> tires

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
biggest different will be the tires

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.149 
biggest different will be the tires
probably<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.759> cars<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.740> don't<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
probably the cars I don't think is so

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.070 
probably the cars I don't think is so
full<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.610> difference<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:07.409> errors<00:02:09.080> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
full of difference the errors is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.940 
full of difference the errors is
inditing<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.370> basically<00:02:12.030> similar

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
inditing but this is basically similar

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.410 
inditing but this is basically similar
one<00:02:13.950> button<00:02:14.400> thing<00:02:14.640> than<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.000> was<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
one button thing than it was in the

front wing before and that has the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.330 
front wing before and that has the
appeared<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:17.970> now<00:02:18.120> steering<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.200> really<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
appeared so now steering so I really the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.250 
appeared so now steering so I really the
main<00:02:20.550> difference<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> tires<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.080> would

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
main difference is the tires I would

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.500 
main difference is the tires I would
guess

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.290 

um

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
um

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.720 
um
if<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.660> don't<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.650> mean<00:02:28.860> I've<00:02:29.430> been

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
if I don't know that I mean I've been

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.790 
if I don't know that I mean I've been
away<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.060> four<00:02:30.480> years<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.930> haven't<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.500> haven't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
away for four years I haven't I haven't

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.470 
away for four years I haven't I haven't
driven<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.460> haven't<00:02:32.820> even<00:02:32.940> sit<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.390> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
driven that I haven't even sit in the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.990 
driven that I haven't even sit in the
formal<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:33.960> car<00:02:34.170> since<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.500> last<00:02:34.770> racing<00:02:35.280> in

formal one car since the last racing in
2009<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.560> mean<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.430> interesting

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
2009 and I mean it will be interesting

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.770 
2009 and I mean it will be interesting
to<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.270> back<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> car<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.880> I'm<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.940> few

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
years older now and nothing nothing else

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.470 
years older now and nothing nothing else

last<00:02:48.810> few<00:02:49.080> years<00:02:49.550> in<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.610> raleigh<00:02:50.940> try<00:02:51.300> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
last few years in the raleigh try to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.140 
last few years in the raleigh try to
learn<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:52.080> been<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:52.830> been<00:02:52.890> difficult<00:02:53.250> some

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
learn it's been it's been difficult some

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.990 
learn it's been it's been difficult some
days<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.830> it's<00:02:55.830> been<00:02:55.920> easier<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.580> year<00:02:56.640> than

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
days and it's been easier this year than

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
days and it's been easier this year than
it<00:02:57.120> was<00:02:57.150> last<00:02:57.300> year<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:57.900> still<00:02:57.960> they<00:02:58.530> say<00:02:58.800> it's

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
it was last year but still they say it's

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.800 
it was last year but still they say it's
very<00:02:59.160> difficult<00:02:59.610> spot<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.180> I'm<00:03:00.600> really

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
very difficult spot but I'm really

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.930 
very difficult spot but I'm really
looking<00:03:00.960> forward<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.650> come<00:03:01.800> back<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.250> at

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
looking forward to come back and at

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.910 
looking forward to come back and at
least<00:03:03.180> four<00:03:03.450> more<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.960> something<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.560> I

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
least four more one is something that I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.710 
least four more one is something that I
I<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.930> how<00:03:06.930> everything<00:03:07.740> works<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.720> I've

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
I know how everything works and I've

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.630 
I know how everything works and I've
been<00:03:09.960> there<00:03:10.230> for<00:03:10.380> many<00:03:10.590> years<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.070> we're<00:03:11.520> not

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
been there for many years like we're not

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.190 
been there for many years like we're not
went<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.090> Raleigh<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.450> didn't<00:03:12.810> really<00:03:13.020> know

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
went to Raleigh I didn't really know

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.140 
went to Raleigh I didn't really know
what<00:03:13.410> what<00:03:13.980> will<00:03:14.220> happen<00:03:14.550> there<00:03:14.790> when<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:14.970> went

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
what what will happen there when I went

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.660 
what what will happen there when I went
to<00:03:15.270> NASCAR<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.020> no<00:03:16.200> clue<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.500> how<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.280> will<00:03:17.460> be

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to NASCAR and no clue on how it will be

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.060 
to NASCAR and no clue on how it will be
so<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.930> way<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.200> should<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.650> much<00:03:19.860> much

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
so in that way it should be much much

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.290 
so in that way it should be much much
easier<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.460> come<00:03:20.760> back<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.350> be<00:03:22.350> pretty<00:03:22.590> normal

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.970 

I<00:03:27.330> mean<00:03:27.870> I've<00:03:28.050> been<00:03:28.200> training<00:03:28.650> all<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.950> time

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
I mean I've been training all the time

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.580 
I mean I've been training all the time
for<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.460> rally<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.120> course<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:31.200> not<00:03:31.290> so

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
for the rally but of course it's not so

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.910 
for the rally but of course it's not so
physically<00:03:32.280> small<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.810> day<00:03:33.990> it's<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.740> whole

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
physically small the day it's the whole

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.070 
physically small the day it's the whole
week<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.550> sitting<00:03:35.940> sitting<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.840> car

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
week that you sitting sitting in a car

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.290 
week that you sitting sitting in a car
in<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.800> rally<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.610> my<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.090> more

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
in a rally and for my one is more

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.830 
in a rally and for my one is more
physical<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.990> more<00:03:40.200> short<00:03:40.500> time<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.510> bi<00:03:42.510> right

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
physical and more short time so bi right

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.340 
physical and more short time so bi right
I<00:03:42.920> started<00:03:43.920> like<00:03:44.610> one<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:45.060> go<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.570> back<00:03:45.750> end<00:03:46.020> in

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
I started like one to go the back end in

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.250 
I started like one to go the back end in
the<00:03:46.440> proper<00:03:47.030> training<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.210> four<00:03:48.570> more<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:48.930> so

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
the proper training for four more one so

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.560 
the proper training for four more one so
I<00:03:49.650> mean<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.130> neck<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.520> most<00:03:50.850> most

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
I mean the neck is the most most

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.170 
I mean the neck is the most most
difficult<00:03:52.050> thing<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:53.160> ready<00:03:53.430> but<00:03:53.730> we

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
difficult thing to get ready but we

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.150 
difficult thing to get ready but we
still<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.510> plenty<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.870> time<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.830> will<00:03:56.010> not

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
still have plenty of time so it will not

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.080 
still have plenty of time so it will not
be<00:03:56.370> an<00:03:56.460> issue

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.770 

I<00:04:00.140> mean<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.220> think<00:04:02.280> that's<00:04:02.670> probably<00:04:03.390> I

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
I mean like if I think that's probably I

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.510 
I mean like if I think that's probably I
was<00:04:04.020> thinking<00:04:04.470> completely<00:04:04.680> different<00:04:05.340> thing

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
was thinking completely different thing

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.940 
was thinking completely different thing
then<00:04:05.760> then<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.599> rising<00:04:06.810> understand<00:04:07.620> those

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
then then the rising understand those

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.729 
then then the rising understand those
tears<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.540> especially<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.989> last<00:04:10.200> right<00:04:10.440> but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
tears but especially the last right but

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.850 
tears but especially the last right but
I<00:04:11.190> mean<00:04:11.459> for<00:04:12.300> sure<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.450> remember<00:04:13.170> all<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.620> all

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
I mean for sure I remember all the all

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.759 
I mean for sure I remember all the all
the<00:04:14.099> breaking<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.420> how<00:04:16.169> quick

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
the breaking and and how quick

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.670 
the breaking and and how quick
everything<00:04:16.919> happens<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:17.669> comparing<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.680> say

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.409 
everything happens so comparing to say
Raleigh<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.340> have<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.519> slightly<00:04:20.880> more<00:04:21.000> time

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
Raleigh you have a slightly more time

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.840 
Raleigh you have a slightly more time
but<00:04:21.690> then<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.470> Raleigh<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.070> don't<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.460> it

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
but then in Raleigh you don't have it

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.700 
but then in Raleigh you don't have it
doesn't<00:04:24.090> keep<00:04:24.360> give<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.290> second<00:04:25.680> chance

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
doesn't keep give you a second chance

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.700 
doesn't keep give you a second chance
when<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.250> make<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> mistake<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:28.080> go<00:04:28.290> off<00:04:28.350> there

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
when you make a mistake you go off there

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.560 
when you make a mistake you go off there
is<00:04:28.800> no<00:04:28.830> runoff<00:04:29.370> areas<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:29.970> there's<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.300> three

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
is no runoff areas and there's a three

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.320 
is no runoff areas and there's a three
or<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:31.400> big<00:04:32.400> ditch<00:04:32.639> so<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.960> informal<00:04:34.889> one<00:04:35.330> these

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
or a big ditch so in informal one these

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.180 
or a big ditch so in informal one these
days<00:04:36.540> you<00:04:36.660> have<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.810> lot<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.139> runoff<00:04:37.350> areas<00:04:37.950> and

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
days you have a lot of runoff areas and

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.430 
days you have a lot of runoff areas and
you<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.400> run<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.729> bit<00:04:39.000> while<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.479> it's<00:04:40.260> not

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
you can run a bit while and it's not

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.379 
you can run a bit while and it's not
such<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.650> big<00:04:40.889> deal<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.250> lose<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.490> lap<00:04:41.760> in<00:04:42.030> a

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
such a big deal you lose a lap in a

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.900 
such a big deal you lose a lap in a
practice<00:04:42.840> or<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.050> qualifying<00:04:43.620> but<00:04:43.860> in<00:04:44.790> the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
practice or a qualifying but in the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.710 
practice or a qualifying but in the
ratio<00:04:45.300> maybe<00:04:45.780> Tony<00:04:46.200> Veloso<00:04:46.710> place<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.600> if<00:04:48.600> we

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
ratio maybe Tony Veloso place so if we

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.170 
ratio maybe Tony Veloso place so if we
show<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.050> braking<00:04:49.500> distance<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.940> chief

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
show the braking distance the chief

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.590 
show the braking distance the chief
force<00:04:51.450> is<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:52.500> acceleration<00:04:53.300> those<00:04:54.300> will

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
force is the acceleration those will

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 
force is the acceleration those will
those<00:04:55.139> will<00:04:55.350> come<00:04:55.500> very<00:04:55.680> quickly<00:04:55.919> back<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.580> I

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
those will come very quickly back so I

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.870 
those will come very quickly back so I
mean<00:04:57.479> just<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.979> biggest<00:04:59.280> thing<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.550> sure

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
mean just the biggest thing for sure

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.780 
mean just the biggest thing for sure
will<00:05:00.060> be<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.810> get<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.110> neck<00:05:01.460> accused<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.669> it

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
will be to get the neck accused to it

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.310 
will be to get the neck accused to it
again<00:05:03.060> but<00:05:04.130> all<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.310> rest<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.850> think<00:05:06.720> it<00:05:07.080> takes

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
again but all the rest I think it takes

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.360 
again but all the rest I think it takes
a<00:05:07.470> while<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:07.919> this<00:05:08.100> not<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.520> big<00:05:08.729> big<00:05:09.180> thing

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.510 

I<00:05:12.960> would<00:05:13.960> have<00:05:14.080> come<00:05:14.290> back<00:05:14.320> if<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.830> were<00:05:15.010> able<00:05:15.250> to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
I would have come back if I were able to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.360 
I would have come back if I were able to
write<00:05:15.730> it<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.530> there's<00:05:17.530> always<00:05:17.680> a<00:05:17.830> lot<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.070> talk

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
write it so there's always a lot of talk

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.880 
write it so there's always a lot of talk
about<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.970> motivation<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.990> but<00:05:20.500> nobody

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
about the motivation and but nobody

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.430 
about the motivation and but nobody
really<00:05:21.250> knows<00:05:22.240> what<00:05:22.540> I<00:05:22.570> do<00:05:22.720> or<00:05:23.050> what<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.290> think

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
really knows what I do or what I think

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.830 
really knows what I do or what I think
but<00:05:24.070> for<00:05:24.250> myself<00:05:24.430> so<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.270> don't<00:05:25.330> really<00:05:25.630> care

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
but for myself so I don't really care

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.210 
but for myself so I don't really care
what<00:05:25.990> people<00:05:26.050> says<00:05:26.650> but<00:05:27.210> I'm<00:05:28.650> enjoy<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:30.040> come
