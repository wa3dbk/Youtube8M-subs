00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.359
 And, folks, beauty because of motives there. 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.490
 questions about the bike has not 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.920
 stability 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.090
 who walks fast who will dismount that 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.889
 is going to explode 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.660
 I'll show you how my meat is dry. 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.910
 who did not fix the dirt because I'm not 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.160
 very fan of licking but not 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 there is the first safety kit that the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:33.600
 people put there the clubs are moped 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.910
 Brake to the canvas on the back and front 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.860
 We have to be amazed in the middle of 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.500
 transit is dangerous first thing that 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.719
 It has to be black. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.030
 the garfield suspensions system 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:49.960
 front is a spyder three teeth of 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.789
 bicycle with 130 mm of travel related to 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 basic plus it's good we have a framework 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 it's a top ten frame 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.960
 with the tubes and the fort 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.350
 this part here he was doing well already 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.210
 format has to become more strengthened 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.100
 my famous bed-foot exhaust and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.860
 tied down with clamps 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.900
 nylon vibration cause if for all of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.280
 iron does not end up damaging 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.530
 to get it that comes in the kit there that 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.119
 It's different, we'll still see each other. 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.119
 flown in with foam filter 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.009
 the items that I changed here are pipe 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.800
 Silicone candle holder 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.930
 the old r d Eca original torneirinha 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.210
 I was watching, I need it. 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 I put gas will power here in valo 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:52.280
 Never ends the coroinha's fuel. 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.990
 little brother and bishop can pull 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.990
 engine history of both spin 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.290
 and since the frame has no adjustment for 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.119
 to stay current put an exchange 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.380
 but just practice running it goes 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.710
 be as broad in order to give 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.710
 comfort 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.820
 and I made a kitten there in the clutch 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.800
 facilitated today's game shortly after 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.390
 I'll show you how it goes. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.750
 the clutch with this dowel that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.360
 simple speedometer the change of place 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.790
 bike will have to make the cats not 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.470
 He gets insane 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.820
 then you should be taught to do this 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.280
 chapinha here 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.900
 can see that the beast is thicker not 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.490
 become equal to that which comes from 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.840
 engine making this cat here too. 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.980
 depom lippi that if someone is in 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 This doubt is missing that does not 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.350
 not just a little bit and that will do with 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.010
 What can I do to improve the place I think? 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.010
 which has no stability 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.490
 the cat here what I did not also in the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.370
 front wheel is smaller than the rear 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.290
 it's 24 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.360
 everything here to help in geometry 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.320
 understood she gets better be smart 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.400
 curve is lighter but does not want to 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.870
 say that you will do this in your 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.540
 bike will stay the same because 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.580
 each frame has a geometry changed one 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.820
 here in the tube here today is another 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:29.610
 The bicycle understood the 60's and 70's when she 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.870
 he's in a good mood 80 and not 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 vibrated could not leave 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.160
 beauty little by little are paying more video 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.160
 there 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.980
 can be voted on and disapproved there 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.220
