on<00:02:34.290> my<00:02:34.320> cow<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.600> just<00:02:36.690> cover<00:02:36.960> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
on my cow so I'm going to just cover the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.200 
on my cow so I'm going to just cover the
back<00:02:37.350> side<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.490> spot<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.180> cut<00:02:41.210> apply

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
back side of the spot that we cut apply

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.800 
back side of the spot that we cut apply
that<00:02:42.600> may<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:42.930> down<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:44.390> again<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.660> cow

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
that may be down here again it's a cow

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.160 
that may be down here again it's a cow
so<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.230> completely<00:02:46.350> random<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.960> I'll<00:02:48.960> use

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
so it's completely random and I'll use

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
so it's completely random and I'll use
the<00:02:49.500> other<00:02:50.090> case<00:02:51.920> I'll<00:02:52.920> stick<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.430> around

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the other case I'll stick that around

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.890 
the other case I'll stick that around
the<00:02:53.760> other<00:02:53.850> side<00:02:53.970> somewhere<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.510> lines<00:02:57.720> up

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the other side somewhere and it lines up

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.900 
the other side somewhere and it lines up
perfectly<00:02:58.380> there<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.040> I've<00:02:59.100> got<00:02:59.220> my<00:02:59.250> cow<00:02:59.580> body

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
perfectly there so I've got my cow body

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.850 
perfectly there so I've got my cow body
and<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.840> we'll<00:03:00.990> assemble<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.500> head<00:03:01.650> before

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860

attaching what I'm going to do for the
ears<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.120> pink<00:03:07.020> pirouette

five-point flowers just color the back

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.420 
five-point flowers just color the back
closer<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.440> top<00:03:10.710> because<00:03:10.920> some<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> that's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
closer to the top because some of that's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.000 
closer to the top because some of that's
going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.700> hang<00:03:11.910> over<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> white<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.380> I'm

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
