00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
52% hopefully I did my math right right

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.240 
52% hopefully I did my math right right
there

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250

and so pictures in a box we got a nice

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.269 
and so pictures in a box we got a nice
combo<00:00:26.820> right<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.869> always<00:00:28.380> let's

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
start with step one up forward triangle

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.770 
start with step one up forward triangle
trying<00:00:31.769> Square<00:00:32.040> back<00:00:32.520> back<00:00:32.730> square<00:00:33.030> plus<00:00:33.480> r2

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and as always enhanced not needed but

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.889 
and as always enhanced not needed but
more<00:00:37.559> damage<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> look<00:00:39.870> like

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
more damage do it is what you look like

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.030 
more damage do it is what you look like
on<00:00:40.230> controller<00:00:41.090> slow-mo<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.390> controller<00:00:43.040> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
on controller slow-mo on controller and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.319 
on controller slow-mo on controller and
then<00:00:44.129> after<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.610> move<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> what

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
then after that we move on to what

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
then after that we move on to what
should<00:00:45.450> look<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> game<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
should look like in the game so if you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.619 
should look like in the game so if you
guys<00:00:47.550> saw<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.820> last<00:00:47.940> common<00:00:48.300> video<00:00:48.510> for

scorpion this should just be deja vu for
you<00:00:50.969> guys<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.899> until<00:00:52.020> step<00:00:52.379> four<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.770> least

you guys and up until step four at least
and<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.780> move<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.020> step<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:56.699> we're

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and so let's move on step to it we're

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.330 
and so let's move on step to it we're
gonna<00:00:57.239> add<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.840> triangle<00:00:58.260> desh<00:00:58.829> back

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
gonna add a up triangle desh back

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.439 
gonna add a up triangle desh back
triangle<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> double<00:01:01.020> pop<00:01:01.289> up

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
triangle and that's just a double pop up

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.460 
triangle and that's just a double pop up
guys<00:01:03.449> were<00:01:03.570> wondering<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> photo<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
guys were wondering what that photo is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.450 
guys were wondering what that photo is
in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> background<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.159> actually<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in the background it's actually a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.590 
in the background it's actually a
burning<00:01:05.880> scorpion

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
burning scorpion

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.740 
burning scorpion
so<00:01:07.110> hopefully<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.650> clears<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.750> some

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so hopefully that clears up some some

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.340 
so hopefully that clears up some some
weirdness<00:01:10.610> but<00:01:11.610> anyways<00:01:12.270> slow-mo<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
weirdness but anyways slow-mo for the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
weirdness but anyways slow-mo for the
control<00:01:13.740> view<00:01:13.950> controller<00:01:14.610> view<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:16.820> see<00:01:17.820> ya

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
control view controller view and see ya

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.550 
control view controller view and see ya
guys<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.540> feel<00:01:18.780> bad<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.229> guys<00:01:19.259> who<00:01:19.470> have

Xbox because that jump kick teleport I
know<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.229> difficult<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.770> Xbox<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.759> can

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

it's<00:01:43.680> hard<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:43.920> Xbox<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.450> on

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's hard for Xbox because as you see on

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's hard for Xbox because as you see on
the<00:01:45.659> ps3<00:01:45.899> controller<00:01:46.439> you're<00:01:46.710> able<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.100> easily

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the ps3 controller you're able to easily

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
the ps3 controller you're able to easily
just<00:01:47.759> slide<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> d-pad<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.110> can't<00:01:49.320> really

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
just slide on the d-pad you can't really

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
just slide on the d-pad you can't really
do<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> Xbox<00:01:50.430> too<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.299> they're

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
do that on the Xbox too much if they're

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.010 
do that on the Xbox too much if they're
really<00:01:51.799> singular<00:01:52.820> singularly<00:01:53.990> hopefully<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
really singular singularly hopefully I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.010 
really singular singularly hopefully I

bottom or bottom to left based on what
pattern<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.409> button<00:02:02.310> Peter<00:02:02.460> so

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
pattern you have to do button Peter so

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.149 
pattern you have to do button Peter so
you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:02.969> slide<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.649> guess<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you can just slide so that's I guess the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.580 
you can just slide so that's I guess the
benefit<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:06.119> ps3<00:02:06.540> users<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> Mortal

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
benefit for ps3 users for a Mortal

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
benefit for ps3 users for a Mortal
Kombat<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.009> other<00:02:08.250> fighting<00:02:08.489> games

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
Kombat and other fighting games

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
Kombat and other fighting games
but<00:02:09.930> uh<00:02:10.070> here's<00:02:11.070> what<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.490> like<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
but uh here's what you look like in the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.960 
but uh here's what you look like in the
real<00:02:11.910> game<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:13.320> uh<00:02:13.730> anything<00:02:14.730> after<00:02:14.880> this

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
real game so uh anything after this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.670 
real game so uh anything after this
point<00:02:15.240> should<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.840> be<00:02:15.960> somewhat<00:02:16.410> different

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
point should just be somewhat different

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.510 
point should just be somewhat different
as<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.790> said<00:02:18.060> step<00:02:18.570> 4<00:02:18.900> step<00:02:19.770> 4<00:02:20.100> we're<00:02:20.250> gonna<00:02:20.340> add

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
as I said step 4 step 4 we're gonna add

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.420 
as I said step 4 step 4 we're gonna add
the<00:02:20.640> triangles<00:02:21.120> or<00:02:21.450> my<00:02:21.900> bet<00:02:22.140> adesh<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.130> then<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
the triangles or my bet adesh and then a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.060 
the triangles or my bet adesh and then a
triangle<00:02:23.970> square<00:02:24.180> triangle<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.900> that's<00:02:25.890> just

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
triangle square triangle and that's just

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.830 
triangle square triangle and that's just
only<00:02:26.220> difference<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.480> -<00:02:27.660> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
only difference there so the - you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.970 
only difference there so the - you
actually<00:02:27.960> kind<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> want<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.470> make<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> long

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
actually kind of want to make a long

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.800 
actually kind of want to make a long
because<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.150> want<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.570> hit<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
because you do not want to hit the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.690 
because you do not want to hit the
triangle<00:02:31.020> square<00:02:31.260> triangle<00:02:31.920> while<00:02:32.550> they're

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
triangle square triangle while they're

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
triangle square triangle while they're
high<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.090> air<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.690> want<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.930> get

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
high in the air but you do want to get

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.380 
high in the air but you do want to get
that<00:02:34.200> full<00:02:34.500> -<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.910> working<00:02:36.300> with

that full - so I just working with

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.810 
that full - so I just working with
timing<00:02:36.600> there<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.430> easy<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.760> go

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
timing there it just really easy just go

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.370 
timing there it just really easy just go
to<00:02:38.880> practice<00:02:39.030> mode<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.600> under<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.230> two

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
to practice mode for like under like two

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.660 
to practice mode for like under like two
minutes<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.860> should<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.190> able<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> get<00:02:41.520> it

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
minutes and you should be able to get it

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.190 
minutes and you should be able to get it
and<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:43.380> course<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:44.280> uh<00:02:44.310> free<00:02:45.000> fire<00:02:45.270> I'll<00:02:46.050> be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and of course that uh free fire I'll be

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.080 
and of course that uh free fire I'll be
explaining<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:47.570> after<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.230> slo-mo<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.310> must

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
explaining that after the slo-mo I must

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
let's move on to the free fire alright

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.130 
let's move on to the free fire alright
for<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.880> free<00:03:15.030> fire<00:03:15.209> pretty<00:03:15.600> much<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.990> want

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
for the free fire pretty much you want

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.930 
for the free fire pretty much you want
to<00:03:16.230> hit<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:16.770> soon<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.550> see<00:03:17.760> them

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
to hit it as soon as you see them

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.360 
to hit it as soon as you see them
getting<00:03:18.209> up<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.380> put<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:19.740> jump<00:03:20.010> setting<00:03:20.250> for

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
getting up and I put on jump setting for

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
getting up and I put on jump setting for
the<00:03:20.430> computer<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.270> see<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:22.080> exact

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
the computer just so you see the exact

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.530 
the computer just so you see the exact
time<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.770> need<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.220> unenhanced<00:03:23.880> demon

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
time you need it for unenhanced demon

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.710 
time you need it for unenhanced demon
fire<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.800> see<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.610> hit<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.090> off<00:03:27.300> fire<00:03:27.570> as

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
fire so I see I hit that off fire as

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.180 
fire so I see I hit that off fire as
soon<00:03:27.930> as<00:03:28.050> they're<00:03:28.230> about<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.800> up<00:03:29.010> and

wake-ups<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.800> will<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.280> really<00:03:35.550> work<00:03:35.870> for

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
wake-ups this will not really work for

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.230 
wake-ups this will not really work for
unenhanced<00:03:37.550> unless<00:03:38.550> they<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.790> stay<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.150> the
