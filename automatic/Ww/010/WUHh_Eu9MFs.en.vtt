really hanging out just a little bit for

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.359 
really hanging out just a little bit for
the<00:01:01.320> scoop<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.129> up

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the scoop so what you do is you know up

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
hard not as hard as you can so school

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.039 
hard not as hard as you can so school
like<00:01:15.960> breaks<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.390> flake<00:01:18.390> off<00:01:18.720> like

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
like breaks off you flake off like

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.770 
like breaks off you flake off like
straight<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.830> straight<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> top<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
straight out straight up from the top of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.740 
straight out straight up from the top of
the<00:01:21.930> nose<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.909> straight<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.540> from

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the nose you up straight out from

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.010 
the nose you up straight out from
the<00:01:24.840> tip<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.430> gives<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.450> friction

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the tip and that gives it the friction

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.560 
the tip and that gives it the friction
so<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> will<00:01:29.130> shove<00:01:29.640> slowly<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:32.450> when<00:01:33.450> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so it will shove slowly here when it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.109 
so it will shove slowly here when it
shoves<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.860> always<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> bring<00:01:35.939> your

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
shoves you're always going to bring your

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
shoves you're always going to bring your
hand<00:01:36.329> back<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.930> towards<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.650> chest<00:01:38.040> or

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hand back like towards your chest or

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.710 
hand back like towards your chest or
body<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> explain<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
body or are you going to explain it

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.160 
body or are you going to explain it
because<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.229> easier<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:45.170> down

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
because it's easier to get it back down

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.969 
because it's easier to get it back down
on<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> board<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.700> its<00:01:48.409> turnaround<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on the board and its turnaround as you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.899 
on the board and its turnaround as you
can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:51.079> my<00:01:52.079> hand

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
can see my hand

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.630 
can see my hand

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
oh the least kind of problem is it going

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.940 
oh the least kind of problem is it going
into<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:41.049> ordeal<00:02:42.049> for<00:02:42.220> which<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:44.230> not<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.530> common

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
into a ordeal for which is not so common

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.240 
into a ordeal for which is not so common
which<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:48.440> bring<00:02:48.769> your<00:02:48.920> hands

which is just if you bring your hands
that<00:02:49.459> way<00:02:49.730> instead<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.870> way<00:02:51.730> which<00:02:52.730> means

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that way instead of this way which means

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.690 
that way instead of this way which means
that<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.569> will<00:02:53.750> create<00:02:54.079> like<00:02:54.530> some<00:02:55.310> friction

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that it will create like some friction

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.839 
that it will create like some friction
 stuff<00:02:56.980> which<00:02:57.980> will<00:02:58.220> make<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.519> go<00:02:58.670> and

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
 stuff which will make it go and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.410 
 stuff which will make it go and
