you know higher scores whatever then i
can<00:02:46.489> i<00:02:46.640> can<00:02:46.700> try<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.349> i'll<00:02:48.349> play<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.829> a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
can i can try and do that i'll play it a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.020 
can i can try and do that i'll play it a
little<00:02:48.950> bit<00:02:49.129> more<00:02:49.280> i'll<00:02:49.400> see<00:02:49.579> them<00:02:49.670> kind<00:02:49.910> of

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
little bit more i'll see them kind of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.339 
little bit more i'll see them kind of
just<00:02:50.209> trying<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.569> mix<00:02:50.720> up<00:02:50.900> with<00:02:51.019> game<00:02:51.140> modes

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
just trying to mix up with game modes

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.690 
just trying to mix up with game modes
and<00:02:51.410> stuff<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.709> play<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.129> whole<00:02:52.310> variety<00:02:52.519> of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and stuff and play a whole variety of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.800 
and stuff and play a whole variety of
things<00:02:52.879> because<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.269> think<00:02:53.390> that's<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.569> basis

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
things because I think that's the basis

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.180 
things because I think that's the basis
for<00:02:53.900> making<00:02:53.989> videos<00:02:54.379> like<00:02:54.470> other<00:02:54.980> want<00:02:55.129> to

one type of game would like one tip like

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.729 
one type of game would like one tip like
team<00:02:59.660> deathmatch<00:02:59.989> after<00:03:00.260> team<00:03:00.410> deathmatch

slums<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.560> actually<00:03:09.709> really<00:03:10.099> like<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.370> map<00:03:10.549> I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
slums I actually really like this map I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.650 
slums I actually really like this map I
think<00:03:10.819> this<00:03:10.879> is<00:03:10.940> probably<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> best

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
think this is probably one of the best

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.119 
think this is probably one of the best
maps<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.049> game<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.680> mean<00:03:12.799> there's<00:03:12.950> not

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
maps in the game and I mean there's not

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.830 
maps in the game and I mean there's not
too<00:03:13.280> many<00:03:13.370> bad<00:03:13.700> maps<00:03:13.970> at<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> game<00:03:14.780> I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
too many bad maps at all in the game I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.390 
too many bad maps at all in the game I
think<00:03:14.930> most<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> maps<00:03:15.829> are<00:03:15.950> really<00:03:16.220> really

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
think most of the maps are really really

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.490 
think most of the maps are really really
good<00:03:16.489> too<00:03:16.730> except<00:03:17.000> her<00:03:17.209> bein<00:03:17.389> harbans<00:03:18.139> fucking

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
good too except her bein harbans fucking

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.559 
good too except her bein harbans fucking
horrible<00:03:18.769> it's<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.639> terrible<00:03:19.970> map<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.480> my

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
horrible it's just a terrible map in my

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.670 
horrible it's just a terrible map in my
opinion<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.900> just<00:03:21.079> don't<00:03:21.230> like<00:03:21.319> played<00:03:21.560> on

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
opinion I just don't like played on

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.129 
opinion I just don't like played on
turbine<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.190> don't<00:03:22.940> know<00:03:23.000> why<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.569> I<00:03:23.840> just

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
turbine I don't know why I just I just

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.710 
turbine I don't know why I just I just
don't<00:03:24.470> like<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.799> but<00:03:25.730> i<00:03:25.790> do<00:03:25.910> like<00:03:26.120> most<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
don't like it but i do like most of the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.879 
don't like it but i do like most of the
maps<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.019> game<00:03:27.200> i<00:03:27.290> like<00:03:27.380> slums<00:03:27.739> in

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
maps in the game i like slums in

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:28.990 
maps in the game i like slums in
particular<00:03:28.280> i<00:03:28.340> think<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.579> is<00:03:28.669> a<00:03:28.700> really<00:03:28.819> cool

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
particular i think this is a really cool

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.640 
particular i think this is a really cool
map<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.450> think<00:03:29.660> me<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> really<00:03:30.079> good<00:03:30.200> job<00:03:30.380> of<00:03:30.500> it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
map I think me the really good job of it

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.050 
map I think me the really good job of it
you<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.280> kind<00:03:31.549> of<00:03:31.579> got<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.849> three

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
you know it's it's kind of got the three

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.339 
you know it's it's kind of got the three
channels<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.750> then<00:03:32.840> they've<00:03:32.989> got<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.200> whole

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
channels and then they've got the whole

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.259 
channels and then they've got the whole
sort<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.650> mean<00:03:34.160> bet<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.519> middle<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.940> so

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
sort of mean bet in the middle and so

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.520 
sort of mean bet in the middle and so
you've<00:03:35.389> got<00:03:35.419> like<00:03:35.660> three<00:03:35.930> pathways<00:03:36.139> down

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
you've got like three pathways down

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.750 
you've got like three pathways down
entire<00:03:36.889> map<00:03:37.099> so<00:03:37.130> you've<00:03:37.340> got<00:03:37.370> kind<00:03:37.700> of

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
entire map so you've got kind of

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.490 
entire map so you've got kind of
feelings<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.389> say<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.260> always

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
feelings and say that you can always

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.159 
feelings and say that you can always
expect<00:03:39.829> people<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.160> be<00:03:40.280> coming<00:03:40.519> from<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.690> I

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
expect people to be coming from and I

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.479 
expect people to be coming from and I
think<00:03:42.380> that's<00:03:42.500> really<00:03:42.560> cool<00:03:42.859> it's<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> good

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
think that's really cool it's a good

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.849 
think that's really cool it's a good
sort<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.209> general<00:03:44.930> layout<00:03:45.109> for<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.470> map<00:03:45.650> and

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
sort of general layout for a map and

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.920 
sort of general layout for a map and
over<00:03:46.609> all<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.760> maps<00:03:47.030> not<00:03:47.239> obviously<00:03:47.510> too<00:03:47.750> big

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
over all the maps not obviously too big

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.089 
over all the maps not obviously too big
it's<00:03:48.109> not<00:03:48.169> too<00:03:48.260> small<00:03:48.410> it's<00:03:48.859> just<00:03:48.980> about

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
it's not too small it's just about

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.280 
it's not too small it's just about
perfect<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.819> yeah<00:03:50.480> that's<00:03:50.569> exactly<00:03:50.810> what<00:03:51.260> she

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
perfect and yeah that's exactly what she

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.370 
perfect and yeah that's exactly what she
