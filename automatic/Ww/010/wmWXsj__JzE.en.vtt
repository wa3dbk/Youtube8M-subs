gonna<00:01:46.270> ask<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:46.659> don't<00:01:46.780> know<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:46.930> was<00:01:46.960> a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
gonna ask I don't know it was a

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.630 
gonna ask I don't know it was a
game-time<00:01:47.290> decision<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.860> was<00:01:47.979> I<00:01:48.070> guess<00:01:48.100> sir<00:01:48.430> and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
game-time decision I was I guess sir and

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640 
game-time decision I was I guess sir and
then<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.630> course<00:01:49.690> had<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.050> switch<00:01:50.229> back<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.440> go

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
then of course had to switch back to go

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.200 
then of course had to switch back to go
in<00:01:50.740> at<00:01:50.830> six<00:01:51.070> but<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.310> can<00:01:51.460> go<00:01:51.610> on<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.729> legal<00:01:51.909> number

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
in at six but I can go on a legal number

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.850 
in at six but I can go on a legal number
so<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.570> don't<00:01:53.110> know<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.590> reason<00:01:53.740> was

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
so I don't know what the reason was

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.200 
so I don't know what the reason was
behind<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.370> mean<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.549> didn't<00:01:54.790> do<00:01:55.030> anything

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
behind it I mean I didn't do anything

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.310 
behind it I mean I didn't do anything
different<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.690> know<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:55.870> I've<00:01:55.930> always<00:01:56.110> done

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
different to know what I've always done

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.050 
different to know what I've always done
score<00:01:56.890> team<00:01:57.040> says<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.520> was<00:01:57.670> like<00:01:57.850> all<00:01:58.000> right

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
score team says so I was like all right

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.000
