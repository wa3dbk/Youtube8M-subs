00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 how good lately was 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.680
 doing a few videos of the day 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.420
 in fact 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 bandrÃ©s that I do this same day but the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.160
 I'm going to go up later but in short the point 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.900
 is that as you can see here is the day 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.250
 it's called true or false 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 this application as I called the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.199
 Attention because his pure name gave me 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.109
 a great idea what it was about that was 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.490
 of an application that is if yes what 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.500
 what are you putting there is true or 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.060
 false as we will see exactly 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 what this application is obviously about is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 free and you can find it in the app 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 store and we can also play in 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.100
 multiplayer or with friends that also 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.989
 have the multiplayer application is with 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 no, but let's play him 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.710
 now solitary just for you to see 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.020
 this more or less what it is about here is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 more or less like a this one a way is 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.140
 all this and obviously since we are going from 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 the start not here tells you that you have to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.649
 give eight correct answers for 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 continue you have eight lives or eight 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.500
 mistakes that can be made by four 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.210
 jokers that are like clues to 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.129
 answer the question and 20 seconds to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 answer each question not then 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.000
 we can play and here we are going to say a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 ask no more 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.960
 It is a Japanese sauce that is eaten with 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.750
 sushi obviously not everyone we know 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 what is the manga and is not that not 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.760
 then we put it fake and it tells us 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.260
 correct we continue in the Moses Bible 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.930
 must guide the slaves out of 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.070
 egypt not read the bible but I think that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.630
 yes and if there is ok now bryant vean is the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.270
 name of a prestigious manufacturer of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.080
 watches I think there's no fear of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 wrong I'll put it was not right 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.060
 in the kitchen you can find them 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.770
 disheartening escorts I think that's 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 to remove the center apples 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.430
 so I'll put it true 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.979
 the refrigerator the refrigerator was invented 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.119
 before the microwave and good 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.119
 question I think so 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.140
 urbi et orbi is a blessing offered 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.850
 for dad 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.130
 they are left with religion like chinga I have 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.270
 luck in the eyes of hunger 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.390
 meat about is voluntary for 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.130
 participate instead of your grandmother does not 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.600
 offers to participate instead of their 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.030
 sister 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.500
 and the best thing is that here it says yes 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.120
 you are correct he tells you why this is 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.620
 right if you're wrong tells you why 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.660
 You're bad and that's not good 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.770
 because that's how you learn and the last question 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.940
 the nun key of a keyboard entails 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.790
 conventional takes you to the panel 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.260
 control not the key does not work for 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.200
 block the numbers and make 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.080
 work the numbers so you put not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.720
 I already had all my life then as 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.459
 can see is an application somewhat of 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.890
 entertaining is this great to be able 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.410
 play with friends or things and see this that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.269
 They both know all that, I like it a lot 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.980
 these economy games in dad we 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.560
 they love these games of knowledge 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.870
 general that they still ask you this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.720
 a random fact like that of hey you know 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.970
 who was the president of the us in 1856 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.890
 and you have gone 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.960
 then pretty much this application is 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.030
 the axis is what that makes you do 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.250
 questions so weird well well then without 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.980
 no context nothing else so you hear 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.840
 you know who this who who made such 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.300
 thing or if the refrigerator was invented 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.760
 before him such a thing then so is 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.300
 how it works, nothing else 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.290
 mention this as it is one I am 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.670
 working hard because I'm talking 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.890
 very fast as it is an application 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.870
 free obviously will be us 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.870
 jumping this fucking publicity that like 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.580
 annoying but this obviously obviously the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.260
 serranilla are still playing but not here 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.440
 I just wanted to show you after 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.550
 pass this first this first step 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.070
 I wanted to show you where the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.200
 second then there are eight questions in 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.810
 is on this level in this I have no idea 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.060
 how many are 99 correct answers 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.700
 then nothing to give an idea 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.220
 How many questions are you going to ask them? 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.010
 see the size of the road is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.569
 quite pretty big big 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.299
 then they will have many questions 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.189
 to answer and even if they have fun 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.170
 although although it is failing but not 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.459
 respond correctly as the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.920
 application tells them the answer 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.420
 correct if they fail then they are going to all 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.430
 modes are going to learn something not even though 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.680
 a game then it is a game like educational 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.539
 I'm not saying it 's for children 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.130
 little ones neither for teenagers nor 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.810
 adults or nothing simply for all the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.870
 world that wants to learn something is not 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.479
 random factum a fact like that without any 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.180
 why with this application what 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.389
 can do and the truth I like 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.210
 a lot of these things like this in fact 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.100
 if you ask and all that we're not going to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.380
 try one more to see how much 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.870
 I just a magnifying glass has concave shape 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.230
 concave I think it's no no that's false 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.790
 is this convex the concave as well as 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.950
 a teaspoon plus encinares 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.480
 enclosures fuck in the case joy the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.650
 most famous hooks to perform in 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.990
 pamplona 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.300
 false ok is true and here he tells us by 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.660
 what have been most famous are made 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.030
 Pamplona there are many times that 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.370
 when it says 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.620
 when you are wrong the answer that gives you 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.180
 it is not very this like that very 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.680
 enlightening truth nothing else tells you 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.080
 that you were wrong the answer was the other 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.090
 but I do not need you explain why 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.640
 you were wrong it does not tell you what the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.330
 correct answer a blizzard is a 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.330
 sand storm 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.700
 I think that not wilde was a writer 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:42.050
 Irish to his fucking mother I do not even have 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:44.270
 true worth and thought ever heard 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.980
 that name to the compulsive desire to steal 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.600
 it's called claustrophobia 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.530
 claustrophobia is to be locked 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.340
 the one of being stealing is kleptomaniac 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.580
 now let's put it 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.440
 here it is and now now if it explains you the 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.810
 compulsive desire to steal is called 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.720
 kleptomania is what he said kleptomaniac 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.389
 and the convulsion and the impulse is called 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.880
 kleptomania in movies with fu 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.169
 panda or is the panda name all 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.610
 we know that if one can forget 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.520
 someone who is called as half of the 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.830
 poop not little then true 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.330
 next the rockefeller building is 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.949
 in new york I have no idea ever and of 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.949
 new york and I have no fucking idea but 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.229
 I'm going to put that yes house that was 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.840
 luck the little mermaid's structure is 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.940
 located the statue with the way structure 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.440
 the statue of the little mermaid is located 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.409
 on a rock in the port of 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.120
 Copenhagen had no idea how 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.159
 pronounce that sound where it is or anything 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.580
 so I'm going to put that fake ok if 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:46.580
 this is valid if you mix red and blue 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.750
 you get green that's 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.750
 red and blue 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:56.289
 do not fuck right I can not think 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:59.949
 right now novak or which ones were yellow 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:05.100
 yellow to uranium is also called 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:06.780
 false uranus cure more a planet 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.370
 scotland yard is the name of a 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.360
 London taxi company is not with 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.360
 harm I think it's the police 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.190
 and I think this is the last the 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.500
 weakness superman resides in the mineral 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.160
 fiction called kryptonite we all know 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.139
 that if then we put that if already 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.870
 well I think it was not so bad but 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:29.060
 well no, it was also this video 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.090
 to demonstrate the application a little 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.130
 how it works and everything and this is why 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.570
 they want to use it, but as you can see 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.910
 every next bite comes out that 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.919
 click annoying advertising but good 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.389
 because thanks to that the application is 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.940
 free not then there's not much of what 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.410
 complain in the end this has been everything I hope 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.810
 that you liked this application of the 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:52.060
 I'm reno 900 day sanction what they and 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.060
 here I say good bye bye
