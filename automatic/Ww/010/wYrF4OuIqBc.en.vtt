00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.420
 What kids do you think that you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 this bug looks 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.340
 it's a kind of weird snail 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.799
 was fidgeting and has appeared by 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.099
 here by the sea ​​and I had not seen it 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.099
 before 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.330
 and it's a kind of weird slug with 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.330
 shell 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.440
 now it will focus on the camera and it's 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.440
 focusing again 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 I'm telling you, it 's a very strange bug, 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.400
 it runs very fast 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
 I do not like to have this kind of bug that 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.550
 I do not know because generally I already 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.550
 I say they are usually bugs 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.829
 that they end up eating corals but 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.720
 good as what you say and I see what is going 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.090
 to go up and we'll see it a little better 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.250
 and we are going to see him 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.240
 realize how weird it is has a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.240
 semi carapace 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.860
 and also they run very fast I'm going to 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.690
 put in the psuv because I do not trust and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.030
 Also, if you eat algae, it's better because 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 the floor is full of shit and what 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.610
 will clean but fix 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.610
 what does this bug look more weird 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.890
 because it goes wild this I do not know why 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.610
 he has to focus on the background man 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 now 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.430
 what to notice that of course this bug is 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.390
 someone knows him then tell me that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.390
 is and what is fed 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 have been born here and I already tell you this is not 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 a piece nor vienna 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.430
 it's a slug with a shell above 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.430
 so we 're not going to put anything in the south 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.299
 because I already tell you that I do not trust 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.090
 I want you to chop the corals so 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.670
 nothing there is going to be left to eat that 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.830
 eat what you want to eat 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.210
 so if anyone knows what it is that I 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.210
 you guys say a greeting
