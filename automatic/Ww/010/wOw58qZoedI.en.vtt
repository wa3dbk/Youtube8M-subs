 as a modality of steps in the world of 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.320
 work because you baby vip at that 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.970

 showcase the many peculiarities that it is 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.020

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.490
 to final year students 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.150
 then they practically do it directly 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.190
 work in practice to perform for 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.890

 where less well-off people live 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.940
 second but it is a proper way to 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.370
 stimulate the student to have their own 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.590

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.350
 theoretical level but also own 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.730
 practical tools remained in practice at 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.970
 better rather than the 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.440
 veterinarian has a multifaceted figure has 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.640

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.740
 prevention of origin infections 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.699
 geological 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.160
 in many people responsible for
