00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.459
 Hello in this video appeared a way to show how they work under Ubuntu 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.410
 9 points counting your own keyboard can create locale 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.010
 so they push the gift the keyboard shortcut on their keyboard and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.450
 already Popp the appropriate program on or appropriate command 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.179
 which you have previously defined will be executed 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.890
 and to set it all up from the system 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.620
 settings 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.830
 Keyboard combinations 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.920
 for some 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 Keyboard combination, there are already preset actions 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 For example, here appointments windows start they should be individual states 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.950
 You will find the key combination here and there you will probably find a deactivated one 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.360
 is not a keyboard shortcut today 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 that is to say, that is, if we serve now in the terminal, for example 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.800
 Now, just want to click on it with a shocker then that has 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.370
 whole never changed in new keytop sion and ubuntu waiting 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.380
 Now on our appropriate input I'll do that's just times 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.660
 by way of example with old 10 that's a good idea it's another question like that 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.130
 as tough is then recorded here directly accordingly 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.840
 as I said that are of course not for all events already appropriate 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 Actions 4 set up that's why we can not do things for those yet 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.310
 Just set it up to never wait for "add" to get it 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.040
 specify the appropriate name for the action 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.040
 In this case, it's easy to start Firefox 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.310
 SupplyOn of course need the appropriate command I'll get 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.550
 now you from my starter 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.550
 Control few control 10 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.160
 Cache and control continued, I have this changed 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.560
 Of course, after I have entered this is still disabled here 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.730
 that until now he just had to add the appropriate action 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.550
 So once I click on it and in this case, that's just old 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.510
 11 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.190
 hard to raise the corresponding directly we can do so next 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.259
 shut down 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.569
 and see if it works well with the old 10 for the console 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.959
 comes directly works so or just old f for Firefox 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.619
 and so the Firefox opens so easy 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.119
 especially when you want to change the command 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.499
 We should be brief Torsten combination 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.929
 a fan double-click on the corresponding command 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.189
 and we can not limit the whole thing
