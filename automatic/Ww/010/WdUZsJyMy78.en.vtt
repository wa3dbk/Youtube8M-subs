00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
explain so I'll show it off later it's

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.120 
explain so I'll show it off later it's
actually<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.880> fun<00:02:41.090> mode<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:42.620> there's<00:02:42.829> by<00:02:43.069> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
actually a fun mode then there's by the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.840 
actually a fun mode then there's by the
numbers<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:45.230> gives<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.620> two<00:02:45.889> rules<00:02:46.250> that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
numbers and it gives you two rules that

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330 
numbers and it gives you two rules that
the<00:02:47.000> numbers<00:02:47.359> have<00:02:47.389> to<00:02:47.569> follow<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.470> you'll

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the numbers have to follow and you'll

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.410 
the numbers have to follow and you'll
just<00:02:49.519> say<00:02:49.730> yes<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.150> no<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.599> shown<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.049> number

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
just say yes or no and shown a number

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.319 
just say yes or no and shown a number
changemaker<00:02:53.560> pretty<00:02:54.560> simple<00:02:54.980> concept<00:02:55.329> you're

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
changemaker pretty simple concept you're

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.780 
changemaker pretty simple concept you're
given<00:02:56.690> an<00:02:56.900> amount<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.410> money<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.280> due<00:02:58.519> and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
given an amount of money that is due and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.059 
given an amount of money that is due and
an<00:02:59.750> amount<00:03:00.049> of<00:03:00.170> money<00:03:00.349> that's<00:03:00.590> someone<00:03:00.829> paid

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
an amount of money that's someone paid

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.430 
an amount of money that's someone paid
and<00:03:01.370> then<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.209> make<00:03:02.359> change<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.589 

triangle<00:03:06.440> math<00:03:06.849> that's<00:03:07.849> another<00:03:08.180> thing<00:03:08.480> I

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
triangle math that's another thing I

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.180 
triangle math that's another thing I
might<00:03:08.630> have<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.079> show<00:03:09.230> off<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:10.099> a

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
might have to show off because it's a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.449 
might have to show off because it's a
little<00:03:10.430> bit<00:03:10.579> difficult<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.239> explain

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
little bit difficult to explain

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.920 
little bit difficult to explain
multitasker<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.120> where<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:14.389> solve<00:03:14.690> a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
multitasker this is where you solve a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.699 
multitasker this is where you solve a
math<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.889> smooth<00:03:16.190> simple<00:03:16.639> math<00:03:16.819> calculations

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
math the smooth simple math calculations

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.990

while<00:03:18.709> something<00:03:19.250> else<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.579> occurring

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
while something else is occurring

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.089 
while something else is occurring
there's<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.780> house<00:03:21.049> near<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.590> top<00:03:21.919> of<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
there's a house near the top of the

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.770 
there's a house near the top of the
screen<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.609> people<00:03:22.940> are<00:03:23.030> going<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.720> out

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
screen and people are going in and out

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.809 
screen and people are going in and out
of<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.019> house<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.829> after<00:03:24.980> you've<00:03:25.310> solved<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
of the house and after you've solved the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.150 
of the house and after you've solved the
series<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.269> calculations<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.950> say

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
series of calculations you have to say

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.690 
series of calculations you have to say
how<00:03:28.669> many<00:03:28.730> people<00:03:28.970> are<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.750> house<00:03:29.900> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
how many people are in the house and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.390 
how many people are in the house and
then<00:03:31.700> finally<00:03:32.120> virusbuster<00:03:32.829> virusbuster<00:03:33.829> is

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
then finally virusbuster virusbuster is

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.640 
then finally virusbuster virusbuster is
not<00:03:34.669> training<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:36.019> basically<00:03:36.530> just

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
not training and it's basically just

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:44.730 
not training and it's basically just
like<00:03:36.950> dr.<00:03:37.519> Mario

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.440 

next<00:03:45.740> on<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.950> list<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.670> mode<00:03:47.060> called

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
next on the list is a mode called

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.360 
next on the list is a mode called
themes<00:03:49.270> this<00:03:50.270> is<00:03:50.630> basically<00:03:51.410> where<00:03:51.710> you<00:03:51.860> get

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
themes this is basically where you get

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.350 
themes this is basically where you get
to<00:03:52.490> either<00:03:53.140> draw<00:03:54.310> take<00:03:55.310> pictures<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:55.970> yourself

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
to either draw take pictures of yourself

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.750 
to either draw take pictures of yourself
or<00:03:57.550> do<00:03:58.550> voice<00:03:58.760> acting<00:04:00.220> kind<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.310> more<00:04:01.580> of<00:04:01.670> an

or do voice acting kind of more of an
imagination<00:04:02.360> thing<00:04:03.970> then<00:04:04.970> next<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.140> list

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
imagination thing then next on the list

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.150 
imagination thing then next on the list
is<00:04:06.500> challenge<00:04:07.250> mode<00:04:08.230> F<00:04:09.230> in<00:04:09.500> your<00:04:09.530> brain<00:04:09.920> age

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
check you'll obtain a score for a brain

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.360 
check you'll obtain a score for a brain
age<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:14.090> 20<00:04:14.690> which<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:14.900> as<00:04:15.320> low<00:04:15.500> as<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.770> gets

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
you unlock challenge mode all I can say

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.560 
you unlock challenge mode all I can say
is<00:04:20.180> it's<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.410> like<00:04:21.680> training<00:04:22.330> except<00:04:23.330> that

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
is it's it's like training except that

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.960 
is it's it's like training except that
there<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> special<00:04:25.040> goal<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.460> need<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.790> meet

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
there is a special goal you need to meet

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.950 
there is a special goal you need to meet
and<00:04:26.150> it's<00:04:26.450> it's<00:04:26.840> much<00:04:27.260> more<00:04:27.590> difficult<00:04:31.960> then

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
and it's it's much more difficult then

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.010 
and it's it's much more difficult then
there's<00:04:33.230> brain<00:04:33.740> each<00:04:33.950> check<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.490> course<00:04:35.020> where

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
there's brain each check of course where

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.380 
there's brain each check of course where
you<00:04:36.200> are<00:04:36.230> giving<00:04:36.680> three<00:04:37.250> special<00:04:37.880> activities

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
you are giving three special activities

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.140 
you are giving three special activities
and<00:04:38.780> depending<00:04:39.770> on<00:04:39.920> your<00:04:40.190> performance<00:04:41.060> in

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
and depending on your performance in

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.170 
and depending on your performance in
those<00:04:41.330> three<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:42.560> get<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.830> brain<00:04:43.160> age<00:04:43.400> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
those three you get a brain age the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.820 
those three you get a brain age the
lower<00:04:44.390> the<00:04:44.570> better<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.170> course<00:04:45.380> 20<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:45.800> the

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
lower the better and of course 20 is the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.000 
lower the better and of course 20 is the
best<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.400> believe<00:04:46.880> 80<00:04:47.420> is<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.930> worst<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.500> then

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
best I believe 80 is the worst and then

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.740 
best I believe 80 is the worst and then
other<00:04:49.250> options<00:04:49.850> are<00:04:50.180> other<00:04:50.540> options<00:04:52.540> not<00:04:53.540> much

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
other options are other options not much

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.460 
other options are other options not much
to<00:04:53.960> say<00:04:54.110> about<00:04:54.140> that<00:04:58.630> Santorelli<00:04:59.630> I'll<00:05:00.140> just

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
to say about that Santorelli I'll just

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:07.060 
to say about that Santorelli I'll just
show<00:05:00.710> off<00:05:00.830> a<00:05:00.860> few<00:05:01.160> quick<00:05:01.340> activities<00:05:06.070> here's

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
show off a few quick activities here's

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
stuff appears here I have to write how

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:32.010 
stuff appears here I have to write how
many<00:05:19.280> numbers<00:05:19.730> are<00:05:20.030> in<00:05:20.900> that

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.160 

so<00:05:32.740> not<00:05:32.890> much<00:05:33.010> really<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.490> say<00:05:33.640> about<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:34.170> at

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
so not much really to say about that at

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.630 
so not much really to say about that at
the<00:05:35.350> end<00:05:35.440> of<00:05:35.590> each<00:05:35.710> level<00:05:36.010> there<00:05:36.220> is<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.370> boss

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
the end of each level there is a boss

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.180 
the end of each level there is a boss
and<00:05:38.730> yeah<00:05:39.730> and<00:05:40.120> then<00:05:40.450> you<00:05:40.510> progress<00:05:40.750> I<00:05:41.260> want<00:05:42.130> to

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
and yeah and then you progress I want to

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.300 
and yeah and then you progress I want to
say<00:05:42.310> there<00:05:42.490> are<00:05:42.580> five<00:05:42.730> levels<00:05:43.500> but<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.800> lost<00:05:45.040> on

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
say there are five levels but I lost on

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.740 
say there are five levels but I lost on
level<00:05:45.550> five<00:05:51.060> also<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> set<00:05:52.360> I'd<00:05:52.510> show<00:05:52.720> off

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
level five also a set I'd show off

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.500 
level five also a set I'd show off
triangle<00:05:53.440> math<00:05:53.620> which<00:05:54.010> also<00:05:54.220> has<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.760> normal

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
triangle math which also has a normal

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.900 
triangle math which also has a normal
and<00:05:55.810> hard<00:05:56.080> mode<00:05:56.260> I'll<00:05:56.680> just<00:05:57.160> be<00:05:57.340> normal<00:05:57.730> for

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
and hard mode I'll just be normal for

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
and hard mode I'll just be normal for
the<00:05:58.000> purpose<00:05:58.300> of<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.570> video<00:05:58.720> and<00:06:00.930> for

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
the purpose of the video and for

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.360 
the purpose of the video and for
triangle<00:06:02.350> math<00:06:02.500> you<00:06:02.680> have<00:06:02.770> to<00:06:02.860> add<00:06:02.980> up<00:06:03.010> these

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
triangle math you have to add up these

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.390 
triangle math you have to add up these
two<00:06:03.670> numbers<00:06:04.380> these<00:06:05.380> two<00:06:05.680> numbers<00:06:06.040> and<00:06:06.310> then

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
two numbers these two numbers and then

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:19.230 
two numbers these two numbers and then
the<00:06:07.210> sums<00:06:07.480> of<00:06:07.690> them<00:06:17.490> so<00:06:18.490> that's<00:06:18.670> basically<00:06:19.120> all

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
the sums of them so that's basically all

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.930 
the sums of them so that's basically all
there<00:06:19.360> is<00:06:19.600> to<00:06:19.780> it<00:06:19.900> you<00:06:20.110> have<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.830> do<00:06:20.950> it<00:06:21.100> 10<00:06:21.790> to

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
there is to it you have to do it 10 to

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.060 
there is to it you have to do it 10 to
20<00:06:22.240> times<00:06:22.620> maybe<00:06:23.620> it<00:06:23.740> was<00:06:23.830> 15<00:06:25.140> so<00:06:26.140> overall<00:06:26.560> I'd

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
20 times maybe it was 15 so overall I'd

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.060 
20 times maybe it was 15 so overall I'd
say<00:06:27.130> that<00:06:27.580> this<00:06:28.080> DSiWare<00:06:29.080> game<00:06:29.260> is<00:06:29.500> in<00:06:29.800> fact

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
say that this DSiWare game is in fact

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.880 
say that this DSiWare game is in fact
worth<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.640> for<00:06:31.000> 800<00:06:31.690> points<00:06:33.210> it<00:06:34.210> has<00:06:34.930> a<00:06:35.290> pretty

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
worth it for 800 points it has a pretty

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.620 
worth it for 800 points it has a pretty
good<00:06:36.070> amount<00:06:36.340> of<00:06:36.430> replay<00:06:36.850> value<00:06:36.880> especially

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
good amount of replay value especially

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.990 
good amount of replay value especially
since<00:06:38.200> it<00:06:38.410> takes<00:06:38.920> some<00:06:39.130> time<00:06:39.370> to<00:06:39.400> unlock<00:06:39.790> the

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
since it takes some time to unlock the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.810 
since it takes some time to unlock the
activities<00:06:41.070> after<00:06:42.070> a<00:06:42.100> certain<00:06:42.430> amount<00:06:42.580> of

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
activities after a certain amount of

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.460 
activities after a certain amount of
days<00:06:43.060> on<00:06:43.480> the<00:06:43.690> calendar<00:06:45.840> you<00:06:46.840> may<00:06:47.020> notice<00:06:47.440> that

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
days on the calendar you may notice that

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.350 
days on the calendar you may notice that
there's<00:06:47.800> a<00:06:47.860> little<00:06:48.130> present<00:06:48.640> if<00:06:48.850> you<00:06:48.940> can<00:06:49.180> see

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
there's a little present if you can see

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.780 
there's a little present if you can see
that<00:06:49.540> on<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:49.780> camera<00:06:50.020> that<00:06:50.580> means<00:06:51.580> on<00:06:51.760> that

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
that on the camera that means on that

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.230 
that on the camera that means on that
day<00:06:52.500> after<00:06:53.500> I<00:06:53.830> believe<00:06:54.130> that<00:06:54.310> would<00:06:54.610> be<00:06:54.790> 25

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
day after I believe that would be 25

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.540 
day after I believe that would be 25
stamps<00:06:56.550> you'd<00:06:57.550> get<00:06:57.760> a<00:06:57.790> new<00:06:58.000> activity<00:06:58.330> and<00:06:59.550> so

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
stamps you'd get a new activity and so

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.970 
stamps you'd get a new activity and so
slowly<00:07:00.880> you<00:07:01.060> fill<00:07:01.900> these<00:07:02.140> up<00:07:02.170> and<00:07:02.590> you<00:07:02.650> get<00:07:02.860> all

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
slowly you fill these up and you get all

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.950 
slowly you fill these up and you get all
the<00:07:03.130> activities<00:07:03.610> then<00:07:04.330> after<00:07:04.570> you've<00:07:04.720> finally

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
the activities then after you've finally

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.650 
the activities then after you've finally
gotten<00:07:05.320> them<00:07:05.500> all<00:07:06.210> there<00:07:07.210> is<00:07:07.360> nothing<00:07:07.840> else

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
gotten them all there is nothing else

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.090 
gotten them all there is nothing else
then<00:07:10.660> it's<00:07:10.900> really<00:07:11.230> just<00:07:11.380> up<00:07:11.590> to<00:07:11.740> you<00:07:11.830> if<00:07:11.980> you

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
then it's really just up to you if you

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.890 
then it's really just up to you if you
want<00:07:12.280> to<00:07:12.340> keep<00:07:12.520> training<00:07:13.210> your<00:07:13.330> brain<00:07:13.570> or

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
want to keep training your brain or

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.750 
want to keep training your brain or
beating<00:07:14.200> your<00:07:14.350> records<00:07:14.770> or<00:07:14.920> something<00:07:15.130> after

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
beating your records or something after

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.670 
beating your records or something after
about<00:07:15.910> 50<00:07:16.810> 60<00:07:17.380> days<00:07:17.860> it<00:07:18.340> gets<00:07:18.430> a<00:07:18.580> bit<00:07:18.730> boring

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
about 50 60 days it gets a bit boring

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.650 
about 50 60 days it gets a bit boring
but<00:07:20.680> I'd<00:07:20.800> say<00:07:21.070> that<00:07:21.100> at<00:07:21.670> least<00:07:21.910> up<00:07:22.150> until<00:07:22.300> that

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
but I'd say that at least up until that

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.510 
but I'd say that at least up until that
point<00:07:22.720> it's<00:07:23.170> definitely<00:07:23.650> worth<00:07:23.800> the<00:07:23.830> 800

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
point it's definitely worth the 800

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.110 
point it's definitely worth the 800
points<00:07:24.700> and<00:07:25.470> if<00:07:26.470> you<00:07:27.310> like<00:07:27.550> these<00:07:27.730> kind<00:07:28.000> of

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
points and if you like these kind of

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.030 
points and if you like these kind of
games<00:07:28.300> and<00:07:29.020> I<00:07:29.050> definitely<00:07:29.470> recommend<00:07:29.770> you

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
games and I definitely recommend you

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.520 
games and I definitely recommend you
pick<00:07:30.190> it<00:07:30.370> up<00:07:30.490> as<00:07:31.360> far<00:07:31.630> as<00:07:31.720> graphics<00:07:32.230> go<00:07:32.470> you

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
pick it up as far as graphics go you

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.370 
pick it up as far as graphics go you
really<00:07:32.890> can't<00:07:33.280> say<00:07:33.520> anything<00:07:33.550> as<00:07:34.210> this<00:07:35.140> game

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:35.380 
really can't say anything as this game

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.560 
really can't say anything as this game
it's<00:07:35.770> not<00:07:36.130> one<00:07:36.610> of<00:07:36.640> those<00:07:36.790> games<00:07:37.060> that<00:07:37.180> can<00:07:37.510> be

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:37.570 
it's not one of those games that can be

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.930 
it's not one of those games that can be
judged<00:07:37.990> by<00:07:38.260> graphics<00:07:38.860> but<00:07:39.460> for<00:07:39.640> what<00:07:39.790> it<00:07:39.910> is

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:39.940 
judged by graphics but for what it is

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.480 
judged by graphics but for what it is
the<00:07:40.270> graphics<00:07:40.690> seem<00:07:40.870> pretty<00:07:41.110> fade

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.100
