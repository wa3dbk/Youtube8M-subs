00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469

and<00:00:55.770> they're<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> take<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> game<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and they're going to take the game and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
and they're going to take the game and
they<00:00:58.050> tend<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> score<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.920> goals<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
they tend to score more goals and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.459 
they tend to score more goals and
Catania<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> last<00:01:00.539> five<00:01:00.960> innings<00:01:01.320> they've

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
Catania in the last five innings they've

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
Catania in the last five innings they've
scored<00:01:01.680> 11<00:01:01.949> goals<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.820> Catania<00:01:03.180> voni<00:01:03.420> scored

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
scored 11 goals and Catania voni scored

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
scored 11 goals and Catania voni scored
27<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> add<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:05.909> that's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
27 and but if you add them all up that's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
27 and but if you add them all up that's
18<00:01:06.570> goals<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.140> five<00:01:07.560> meetings<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.310> with

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
18 goals in five meetings I think with

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.910 
18 goals in five meetings I think with
definitely<00:01:08.729> innocent<00:01:09.119> girls<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.659> game

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
definitely innocent girls in this game

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.289 
definitely innocent girls in this game
okay<00:01:10.920> yeah<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.460> contain<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.030> actually

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
okay yeah well contain you have actually

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
okay yeah well contain you have actually
scored<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.840> five<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> their<00:01:13.680> last<00:01:13.710> matches

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
scored in all five of their last matches

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
scored in all five of their last matches
so<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.450> safe<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.110> ever<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so a pretty safe if ever there is one is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640 
so a pretty safe if ever there is one is
Catania<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> safe<00:01:18.540> bet<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.990> kittanning<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
Catania as a safe bet it's kittanning to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
Catania as a safe bet it's kittanning to
school<00:01:19.860> priced<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.390> 1.36<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
school priced at 1.36 but it is this

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.390 
school priced at 1.36 but it is this
price<00:01:22.740> worth<00:01:22.950> taking<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> put

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
price worth taking and I'm going to put

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.160 
price worth taking and I'm going to put
my<00:01:26.430> money<00:01:26.729> elsewhere<00:01:26.939> Nutley<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
my money elsewhere Nutley I think the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.330 
my money elsewhere Nutley I think the
game<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> bit<00:01:28.829> closer<00:01:29.100> than

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
game is going to be a bit closer than

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
game is going to be a bit closer than
that<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:30.090> scoring<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that and I think them scoring is a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.179 
that and I think them scoring is a
little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.439> too<00:01:31.590> much<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> foregone

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
little bit too much a foregone

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520 
little bit too much a foregone
conclusion<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:33.869> either<00:01:34.170> side<00:01:34.439> are

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
conclusion I don't think either side are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.840 
conclusion I don't think either side are
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> keep<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> clean<00:01:35.159> sheet<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.640> game

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
going to keep a clean sheet in this game

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.359 
going to keep a clean sheet in this game
so<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.299> betting<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.829> side<00:01:38.040> scoring

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
so I think betting on one side scoring

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
so I think betting on one side scoring
is<00:01:38.640> pretty<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> safe<00:01:39.600> bet<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
is pretty much it's a safe bet but it's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.420 
is pretty much it's a safe bet but it's
not<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> make<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.619> pretty<00:01:40.920> rich<00:01:41.159> I'm

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
not going to make you pretty rich I'm

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
not going to make you pretty rich I'm
more<00:01:41.909> attempted<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.540> half<00:01:43.079> time<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.560> full

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
more attempted by the half time and full

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.950 
more attempted by the half time and full
time<00:01:43.799> results<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.270> winning<00:01:45.509> both<00:01:45.689> house

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
time results get into winning both house

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
time results get into winning both house
at<00:01:46.200> four<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.890> katina<00:01:47.850> burning<00:01:48.149> house

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
at four to one and katina burning house

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.420 
at four to one and katina burning house
both<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.170> five<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.189> yeah<00:01:50.310> it's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
going to be close but I think we're

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
going to be close but I think we're

the<00:02:21.300> thing<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:21.870> picking<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.200> right

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the thing is with picking the right

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.050 
the thing is with picking the right
score<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.830> only<00:02:22.980> takes<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.370> second<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.790> score

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
score it only takes a second to score

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.210 
score it only takes a second to score
goal<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.540> indeed<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.080> concede<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.560> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
goal or indeed to concede one so

goal or indeed to concede one so
although<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.730> could<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:26.940> sitting<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.540> one

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
although you could be sitting on to one

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.440 
although you could be sitting on to one
for<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.050> best<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.470> part<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.950> 40<00:02:29.370> minutes<00:02:29.700> one

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
for the best a part of 40 minutes one

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.600 
for the best a part of 40 minutes one
moment<00:02:30.660> come<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.350> goal<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.709> go<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.040> an

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
moment come up a goal and go in an

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.460 
moment come up a goal and go in an
offside<00:02:32.790> goal<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.510> be<00:02:33.540> given<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:33.990> not<00:02:34.140> given

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
offside goal can be given are not given

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.690 
offside goal can be given are not given
and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.830> make<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.130> difference<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and I can make all the difference to a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
and I can make all the difference to a
bit<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.720> yeah<00:02:36.930> when<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> pro

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
bit so I think yeah when you're a pro

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.660 
bit so I think yeah when you're a pro
like<00:02:37.680> me<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.980> should<00:02:38.100> always<00:02:38.220> pick<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.459> best

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
like me you should always pick the best

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.490 
like me you should always pick the best
score<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.690> put<00:02:40.050> your<00:02:40.140> money<00:02:40.260> where<00:02:40.350> your

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
score and put your money where your

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
score and put your money where your
mouth<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> think<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.700> you're<00:02:41.820> me<00:02:41.940> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
mouth is but I think if you're me a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.510 
mouth is but I think if you're me a
civilian<00:02:42.480> play<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.680> safer<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.310> go
