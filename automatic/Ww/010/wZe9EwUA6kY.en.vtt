00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
there on the map and there was two gates

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.000 
there on the map and there was two gates
here<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.440> want<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.829> is

here like so so what you want to do is
simply<00:00:44.280> push<00:00:44.520> open<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.059> gate<00:00:45.270> until<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
simply push open this gate until it is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
simply push open this gate until it is
wide<00:00:46.440> open<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.670> is

wide open then what you want to do is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
wide open then what you want to do is
take<00:00:48.120> cover<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> wall<00:00:49.140> until<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> gate

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
take cover by this wall until the gate

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
take cover by this wall until the gate
starts<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.730> crazy<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.899> the

starts going crazy so as you can see the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
starts going crazy so as you can see the
gate<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.829> crazy<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.969> what

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
gate is now going crazy and then what

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.639 
gate is now going crazy and then what
you<00:00:54.120> want<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> poke<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.140> head<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you want to do is poke your head out of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
you want to do is poke your head out of
the<00:00:55.920> gate<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.539> basically

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the gate if you can now that basically

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
the gate if you can now that basically
speeds<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> process<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.430> see

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
speeds up the process and as you can see

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.459 
speeds up the process and as you can see
any<00:00:59.969> second<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.020> somebody<00:01:01.170> flying

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
any second now it was somebody flying

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
any second now it was somebody flying
into<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.070> air<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.149> glitch<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
into the air and this glitch is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
into the air and this glitch is
hilarious<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.500> definitely<00:01:04.769> had<00:01:04.949> fun<00:01:04.979> while

that is pretty much how you do the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.820 
that is pretty much how you do the
collector<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.470> pretty<00:01:16.680> much

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
collector it's pretty much

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
collector it's pretty much
self-explanatory<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> better

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
self-explanatory there is the better

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
self-explanatory there is the better
version<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.590> two-player<00:01:20.040> version

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
version which is the two-player version

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
version which is the two-player version
as<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.119> can't<00:01:21.420> die<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.140> actually

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
as you can't die from that you actually

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
as you can't die from that you actually
go<00:01:22.560> flying<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> air<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.700> come

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
go flying in the air and when you come

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
go flying in the air and when you come
back<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.659> die<00:01:24.930> whereas<00:01:25.530> with

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
back down you do not die whereas with

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.929 
back down you do not die whereas with
the<00:01:25.799> solar<00:01:25.979> method<00:01:26.340> i'm<00:01:26.430> showing<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.880> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the solar method i'm showing you now you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
the solar method i'm showing you now you
do<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.360> die<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> land<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
do actually die when you land but it is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
do actually die when you land but it is
still<00:01:29.130> very<00:01:29.280> funny<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.090> saw<00:01:30.210> there

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
still very funny as you just saw there

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
still very funny as you just saw there
my<00:01:30.570> character<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.350> crazy<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.220> once

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
my character was going crazy and once

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.380 
my character was going crazy and once
again<00:01:32.549> i'm<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.060> showing<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.360> guys

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
again i'm going to be showing you guys

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
again i'm going to be showing you guys
that<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.590> again<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.130> simply<00:01:35.430> push<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that so once again just simply push the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.359 
that so once again just simply push the
gate<00:01:36.030> open<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.350> cover<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.890> if

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
gate open like so then take cover and if

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.710 
gate open like so then take cover and if
the<00:01:38.520> gate<00:01:38.700> does<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.210> crazy<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.689> first

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the gate does not go crazy the first

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
the gate does not go crazy the first
time<00:01:40.170> simply<00:01:40.439> push<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> open<00:01:40.979> again<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.909> take

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
time simply push it open again then take

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.819 
time simply push it open again then take
over<00:01:42.420> once<00:01:42.630> again<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> maybe<00:01:43.290> even<00:01:43.470> point

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
over once again and maybe even point

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
over once again and maybe even point
your<00:01:44.009> face<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> left<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.240> simply

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
your face to the left and then simply

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
your face to the left and then simply
point<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.170> afterwards<00:01:46.680> i'm<00:01:46.860> not

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
point it to the right afterwards i'm not

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.620 
point it to the right afterwards i'm not
entirely<00:01:47.520> sure<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.939> does<00:01:48.180> help<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
entirely sure if that does help but you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.690 
entirely sure if that does help but you
can<00:01:48.750> try<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> anyway<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.520> as

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
can try that anyway as you can see as

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
can try that anyway as you can see as
you're<00:01:50.909> poking<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.299> head<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> gate

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you're poking your head out of the gate

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.539 
you're poking your head out of the gate
it<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.439> eventually<00:01:52.680> seems<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> flying<00:01:53.490> back

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it will eventually seems you flying back

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.730 
it will eventually seems you flying back
into<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> air<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.450> sometimes<00:01:54.930> guys<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
into the air now sometimes guys you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.230 
into the air now sometimes guys you
can't<00:01:56.009> actually<00:01:56.189> die<00:01:56.549> i<00:01:56.579> tried<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.030> around

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
can't actually die i tried this around

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.020 
can't actually die i tried this around
four<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.990> five<00:01:58.170> times<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.829> died<00:01:59.040> once<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.969> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
four to five times and I died once but I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.459 
four to five times and I died once but I
know<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.360> can't<00:02:00.600> die<00:02:00.780> quite<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> lot<00:02:01.350> from

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
know that you can't die quite a lot from

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
know that you can't die quite a lot from
this<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.890> sometimes<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.520> will<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.820> crazy

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
this but sometimes you will go crazy

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.120 
this but sometimes you will go crazy
like<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.110> absolutely<00:02:04.860> insane

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
like this and this is absolutely insane

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.920 
like this and this is absolutely insane
as<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:05.939> my<00:02:06.090> character<00:02:06.479> now<00:02:06.630> start

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
as you can see my character now start

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.779 
as you can see my character now start
spinning<00:02:07.200> around<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.619> 100<00:02:08.340> miles<00:02:08.489> per<00:02:08.670> hour

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
spinning around like 100 miles per hour

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
spinning around like 100 miles per hour
I<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.629> dying<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.170> laughter<00:02:10.319> when<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I was need dying in laughter when I

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.960 
I was need dying in laughter when I
actually<00:02:10.830> saw<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> first<00:02:11.520> time<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.790> never

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
actually saw this the first time I never

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually saw this the first time I never
actually<00:02:12.330> saw<00:02:12.540> anything<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.140> before

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
actually saw anything like this before

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
actually saw anything like this before
it<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.160> looks<00:02:14.340> absolutely<00:02:14.700> insane<00:02:15.300> when

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it just looks absolutely insane when

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.790 
it just looks absolutely insane when
he's<00:02:15.540> spinning<00:02:15.870> around<00:02:15.959> like<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.650> it's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
he's spinning around like this so it's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.870 
he's spinning around like this so it's
definitely<00:02:17.130> one<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.280> those<00:02:17.370> funny<00:02:17.640> glitches

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
definitely one of those funny glitches

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.640 
definitely one of those funny glitches
you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.270> do<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.690> I'm<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:19.349> going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> be

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you can do and I'm now going to be

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.260 
you can do and I'm now going to be
showing<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:20.010> guys<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> better<00:02:20.670> version<00:02:20.819> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
showing you guys the better version of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.030 
showing you guys the better version of
this<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.599> one<00:02:21.780> way<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:21.989> can't<00:02:22.410> die<00:02:22.709> when<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
this the one way you can't die when you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.860 
this the one way you can't die when you
land<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.459> do<00:02:23.670> require<00:02:23.910> two<00:02:24.239> people<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.690> do

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
land they do require two people to do

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.449 
land they do require two people to do
but<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.230> definitely<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.890> funnier<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
but it is definitely the funnier and

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.640 
but it is definitely the funnier and
better<00:02:26.520> version<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.510> glitch<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
better version of this glitch so you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.110 
better version of this glitch so you
want<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.160> achieve<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.849> simply

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
want to do to achieve this is simply

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000 
want to do to achieve this is simply
have<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.599> player<00:02:30.870> walk<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> gate<00:02:31.830> look

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
have one player walk up to the gate look

you can see now from my perspective when
I<00:03:03.150> run<00:03:03.360> into<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.660> gate<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.200> crazy<00:03:04.470> teddy<00:03:04.799> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
taking cover exactly where I was a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.949 
taking cover exactly where I was a
minute<00:03:07.049> ago<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.470> go<00:03:08.220> flying<00:03:08.489> into<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.299> air<00:03:09.510> so

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
minute ago I go flying into the air so

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.600 
minute ago I go flying into the air so
as<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.200> can<00:03:10.290> see<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.769> even<00:03:10.950> run<00:03:11.220> or<00:03:11.459> walk

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
as you can see you can even run or walk

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.580 
as you can see you can even run or walk
into<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.540> cut<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> pulp<00:03:13.140> straight

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
into it and you just cut a pulp straight

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.289 
into it and you just cut a pulp straight
into<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.860> air<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:15.060> keep<00:03:15.239> going

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
into the air like so you keep going

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.820 
into the air like so you keep going
higher<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.810> higher<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.530> even<00:03:16.620> get

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
higher and higher and you can even get

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.500 
higher and higher and you can even get
sent<00:03:17.069> across<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> map<00:03:17.730> not<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.150> high<00:03:18.269> into

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
sent across the map not just high into

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.210 
sent across the map not just high into
the<00:03:18.540> air<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:19.530> get<00:03:19.769> sent<00:03:20.010> into

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the air you can actually get sent into

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.740 
the air you can actually get sent into
so<00:03:20.400> many<00:03:20.459> different<00:03:20.579> places<00:03:20.880> with<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
so many different places with this and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.360 
so many different places with this and
the<00:03:22.170> best<00:03:22.380> part<00:03:22.530> about<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:22.950> when<00:03:23.250> you

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the best part about this is when you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.920 
the best part about this is when you
come<00:03:23.519> back<00:03:23.640> down<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.030> don't<00:03:24.209> die<00:03:24.480> which<00:03:24.660> makes

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
come back down you don't die which makes

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.240 
come back down you don't die which makes
it<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.320> much<00:03:25.530> funny<00:03:25.829> how<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.130> each

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250
