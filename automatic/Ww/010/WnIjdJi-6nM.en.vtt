bunch of them but there aren't quite 40
and<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:58.980> sure<00:00:59.070> I<00:01:00.059> don't<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.930> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and I'm pretty sure I don't know if you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.420 
and I'm pretty sure I don't know if you
actually<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> pick<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> item<00:01:02.280> like

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
actually have to pick up the item like

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.399 
actually have to pick up the item like
you<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.670> search<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.260> an

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you can search it and if it's like an

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
you can search it and if it's like an
attachment<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.159> necessarily<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
attachment you don't necessarily have to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
attachment you don't necessarily have to
attach<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.510> weapon<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.049> believe<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
attach it to your weapon I believe that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.920 
attach it to your weapon I believe that
still<00:01:08.010> counts<00:01:08.490> towards<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> trash<00:01:09.630> picker

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
still counts towards the trash picker

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580 
still counts towards the trash picker
but<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.200> could<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.560> mistaken<00:01:11.510> if<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.720> doesn't<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
but I could be mistaken if it doesn't I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.539 
but I could be mistaken if it doesn't I
mean<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.430> does<00:01:14.700> count<00:01:15.560> then<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.590> need<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
mean if it does count then you need to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
mean if it does count then you need to
go<00:01:17.729> through<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.720> only<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> town<00:01:19.470> get

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
go through not only the town get

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
go through not only the town get
everything<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:22.049> you're<00:01:22.170> playing
