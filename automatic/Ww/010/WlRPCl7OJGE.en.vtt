 facebook group plates and so on 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.739

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 facebook twitter google plus video her 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.649
 two topics and a bit of a babe 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.690
 the first male basically namely 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.750

 For profil we refer that it for the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 why am I interested here? 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.379
 photography babbel yes yes there is currently 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.120
 what is interesting and what is me 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.890
 a little bit what I'm wondering 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.030
 make the people seem almost no 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.229
 ask more as good as no more 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.580
 and that's why it stands again 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 any questions be it too 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.450
 Battlefield is to be on the canal 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.049
 it looks to something else 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.880
 ask here 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.780
 I grab her and take her home 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.430
 Next day follow out again so 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 what is it about today as I said naval 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 strike it gives the first screenshots 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.290
 Of course, I do not want to move on 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.790
 of course, if you stay on the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.890
 Battlefield blog to be linked 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.340
 just talk about the first screenshots 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.530
 Let's start with the first screenshots 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 to label strike again a bit 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.140
 Operation metro gameplay why plays 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.439
 The band is actually on time 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.189
 I try it needs 3000 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.170
 unlock 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.990
 it works is easy I'm not working 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.430
 do not gfz war no matter what I do 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.439
 I think I'm doing my checklist 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.350
 and become each and every one 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.610
 It's easy to look at it from the end 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 stucky is or is it really me 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 okay to do ours everything 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 Well, in any case, we see here 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.009
 screenshot of a hoard croft that is 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.119
 a new amphibious vehicle naval strike 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.590
 I 'm really a bit bigger 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.950
 presented presented it is one 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 bit is like here day island in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.620
 bf3 where to get this fast then 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.749
 But forces on the beach gets where the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.010
 fans did not like it that much 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.810
 quite big but a bit bigger 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.859
 I 'm on that would be quite funny 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.709
 In any case, we already see here 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:24.920
 one of the maps and that's just like me 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.780
 now have the webos share 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 or forgotten islands in German I 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.099
 hope that means in English lost one 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.629
 soft the German profi block in front of me 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.310
 and have a little bit 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.669
 probably give fish farms and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.639
 a crashed scanner was not 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.680
 human pronounce passenger plane in 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.389
 the middle of what a pretty determined 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.060
 Cool flair promises and I think 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.099
 that these maps times by their yes lake 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.449
 definitely fight from the others 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.139
 apps here too fonseca son of course 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:56.659
 take off strongly to the next 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.819
 screenshot so on the next picture 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.199
 then we see another boat spd 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.459
 is being tracked and this 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:04.489
 I really like vehicle construction 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.989
 well in the new year your fashion so 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.480
 actually the vital mode 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.370
 battlefield 21 42 imagine the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.019
 works almost exactly as there is 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.569
 two aircraft carriers, so to speak 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.220
 will be attacked by each 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.810
 opposing team that means you have to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.489
 on the one hand then an aircraft carrier 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.689
 defend like the look of stetten 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.669
 Everything is still in the stars 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.659
 So also that a multi-level part 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:28.459
 will be where you first, for example , the spirit 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.900
 and with a little boat in and must 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.269
 somehow turn off the anti-aircraft 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.949
 must or somehow the area defense 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.299
 must leave and then the core the 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.939
 air here must I know me 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.139
 Maybe the aircraft carrier is sorry 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.159
 I do not know because I do not have any 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.549
 I know the whole stuff but I could 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.459
 Imagine very well and if you do 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.409
 so much variability 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.379
 built in the maps as if that is 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.239
 a bit more on land and a game 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.769
 a little bit more on the lake fight is out 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.109
 then you could sure about some cool 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.879
 10 have tinker and I could be very 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.109
 very well imagine that one 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.819
 my favorite player motivates because 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.319
 where you attacked and at the same time 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.060
 there must always be a lot of defense 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.680
 action has a lot of dynamism in it and so on 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.000
 I like it very much in general 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.919
 Battlefield franchise continues with the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.930
 next screenshot of show us now 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.890
 one of the said aircraft carriers and 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.060
 that they look pretty cool then 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.350
 what looks on it I have the feeling that 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.479
 Ding even goes that means we can 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.500
 We look forward to these things 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.130
 probably a little bit around that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.720
 website 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.639
 that is, for example, one such 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.530
 island group has that which is it 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.690
 to move against the law that one 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.270
 then really different ones 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.220
 situations the respective team has 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.440
 what kind of the way to the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.080
 plane carrier concerns and something could 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.729
 I imagine pretty cool 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.720
 if one does not simply two static 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.340
 but things really have 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.710
 you can always move a bit 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.960
 reality in the maps themselves yet 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.960
 I have to say sexy picture 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.940
 image siege love to pin matter 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.560
 insider at least meanwhile 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.669
 No one cares anymore 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.960
 In any case , we see a picture of 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.270
 Little bird in the sunset 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.430
 flies while beautiful 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.979
 Boats under fire takes and thus 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.919
 hellish distance in chinese 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.240
 dream he kindled enough of the situation was that 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.010
 Here's one for a little one 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.090
 bird mended another boat 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.830
 and I would imagine that the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.419
 one of the other three maps in the dlc are 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.190
 in addition to forgotten islands so 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.580
 probably going to share or any 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.500
 so there are still the maps if 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.880
 burglar in the lancia attack and 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.430
 Operation moerser sounds as a wave 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.650
 braker landscape and on which motto 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.789
 sounds a bit better so should 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.289
 do now does not worry plays 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.910
 game lives on angel again i have 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.460
 actually deleted the language files 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.130
 will I have to do it again but times 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.479
 patch at the patch gets you over the 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.080
 new sports events game in german 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.389
 but no matter 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.760
 In any case, you are the four 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.210
 maps forgotten islands wave is a 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.380
 Spray can paint resort operations 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.849
 pretty cool lame and I hope so too 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.020
 pretty cool maps from the concept 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.419
 I really like the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.370
 champions road mode think that you still 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.580
 maybe capture the current us congress 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.560
 to termination tdm and I think so too 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.270
 areas security and the whole stuff 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.250
 then everything can play on the maps 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.630
 is this in wales strike dlc 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.070
 maybe one of the most extensive up 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.289
 now in Berlin there are up now 3 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.099
 but we prefer to determine one of the of 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.630
 Ten years ago 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.060
 In short, I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.030
 but now I have enough of davis cup 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.680
 and said I want 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.240
 my photographs so far i have 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.040
 nor a girlfriend is right now 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.390
 learn about musical tarzan 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.380
 so if you have seen that , you are gone 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.910
 is in there was definitely cool me 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.450
 animal-like, no matter now on the subject 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.840
 photography 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.010
 l have always been very often lately 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.940
 with my group flor or next 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.620
 you know, maybe it's included 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.140
 want to live again something with the house 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.820
 did perhaps from before 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.060
 many ministers clicked 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.460
 and I have to say this is my second one 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.190
 hobby meanwhile I 'm gambling 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.580
 and so I meet and make fitness 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.930
 last soft and there comes my laugh 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.910
 really cool photos of them will be times 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.940
 look at link to my px 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.660
 profi below and fight back here now 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.830
 maybe a few more pictures 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.750
 embed in case a couple cool 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.800
 synonymous find the synonymous format fit 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.720
 because that's a bit silly that in
