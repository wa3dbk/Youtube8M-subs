gold<00:00:42.989> pins<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:45.000> battery<00:00:45.329> area<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.140> you'll

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
gold pins on the battery area and you'll

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
gold pins on the battery area and you'll
just<00:00:46.530> take<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.370> receiver<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.450> here

you<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.700> 6<00:01:06.060> pins<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.540> match<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.960> really

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you get about 6 pins to match up really

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
you get about 6 pins to match up really
easy<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:09.090> fits<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.540> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
inside pretty securely but the thing

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
inside pretty securely but the thing
that<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> notice<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.650> sticks<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:41.009> just

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that I notice is that it sticks out just

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
that I notice is that it sticks out just
a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.369> bit<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.090> mini<00:01:42.299> USB<00:01:42.570> cable<00:01:43.200> seems<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
a little bit the mini USB cable seems to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
a little bit the mini USB cable seems to
the<00:01:44.790> tip<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> seems<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:45.869> bit<00:01:46.110> longer

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the tip if it seems a little bit longer

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.010 
the tip if it seems a little bit longer
than<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.799> average<00:01:47.540> connections<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.780> just

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
than your average connections so just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.920 
than your average connections so just
get<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:50.610> sure<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:50.970> not

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
get it in there make sure that's not

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
get it in there make sure that's not
gonna<00:01:52.020> pop<00:01:52.259> out<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.560> anything<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.149> but

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
gonna pop out or anything like that but

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.490

that it's charging wirelessly and some

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.510 
that it's charging wirelessly and some
functions<00:02:06.540> may<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.990> work<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> S<00:02:08.190> Pen

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520

with<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> note<00:02:09.239> 3

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
with the note 3

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.990 
with the note 3
now<00:02:12.390> some<00:02:13.350> things<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.770> did<00:02:13.980> notice<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.550> I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
now some things that I did notice as I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.610 
now some things that I did notice as I
use<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:17.490> did<00:02:17.880> not<00:02:18.030> charge<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.870> fast<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.500> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
use this it did not charge as fast as I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.710 
use this it did not charge as fast as I
wanted<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> actually<00:02:21.030> charge<00:02:21.209> was<00:02:21.390> really

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
wanted it to actually charge was really

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.449 
wanted it to actually charge was really
slow<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.290> that's<00:02:23.130> due<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:25.130> adapter<00:02:26.130> here

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
slow and that's due to the adapter here

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.309 
slow and that's due to the adapter here
it's<00:02:26.670> not<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.880> very<00:02:27.180> powerful<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
it's not a very powerful one so what I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.460 
it's not a very powerful one so what I
had<00:02:28.500> discovered<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:29.540> take<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.840> USB<00:02:31.230> cable

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
had discovered was take the USB cable

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.699 
had discovered was take the USB cable
and<00:02:31.830> plug<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.220> into<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.790> note<00:02:33.030> 3<00:02:33.530> adapter<00:02:34.530> that

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
and plug it into the note 3 adapter that

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.559 
and plug it into the note 3 adapter that
came<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.310> your<00:02:36.090> phone<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.970> after<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
came with your phone and after that

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.559 
came with your phone and after that
point<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.989> noticed<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.440> charge<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:40.980> well<00:02:41.280> a

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
point I noticed the charge really well a

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.360 
point I noticed the charge really well a
couple<00:02:42.569> nice<00:02:43.110> little<00:02:43.140> things<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
couple nice little things is that the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.640 
couple nice little things is that the
TPU<00:02:44.760> case<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.360> even<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.750> thick<00:02:45.959> case<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.500> this

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
TPU case and even a thick case like this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.030 
TPU case and even a thick case like this
say<00:02:46.860> do<00:02:47.810> surface<00:02:48.810> case<00:02:49.019> actually<00:02:49.290> works<00:02:49.709> with

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
say do surface case actually works with

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.610 
say do surface case actually works with
the<00:02:50.280> charger<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:50.780> really<00:02:51.780> cool<00:02:51.959> stuff<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.410> like

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
how I could still have a case and use

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.960 
how I could still have a case and use
this<00:02:54.420> wireless<00:02:55.050> charger<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.769> wanted<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.220> so
