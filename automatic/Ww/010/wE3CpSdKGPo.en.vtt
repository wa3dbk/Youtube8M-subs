00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
 unity3d 100 tease how to create 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.639
 games 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.450
 hello everyone with you the team fogeym and this 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.650
 our second lesson on macromedia flash 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.550
 in this lesson I will teach you to create 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.300
 animation 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.300
 example stages 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.950
 Before starting the animation, I would like to 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.070
 tell about those understand in general which 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.630
 there are fixated ie 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.610
 repeating animation 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 there is no fixation on non-repeating 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.430
 animation unfortunately macromedia flash 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 there is no such thing and therefore even if 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.330
 you will create an animation do not hook on like u 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.900
 me macromedia will still be him 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.900
 play several times 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.540
 like this and now actually to your 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.290
 animation to begin with create a new 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:08.140
 project for this click file new and click 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:11.900
 ok and go heat-resistant project 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.990
 click here arrow 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 and choose background change background on 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.720
 Any where you like the color I'll take 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 Andrew 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.440
 out of turn 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 now draw a ball choose in the panel 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
 that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.340
 I will have the actual ball and color 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.340
 white 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.740
 everything went animation i put on the ball 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.689
 glow effect low 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.789
 let's apply it here just the same 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.299
 tell you about the effects for this 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.819
 right click on the ball 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.049
 choose envelope character click ok 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.229
 Now go to the project settings and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.060
 choose filters line 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:14.090
 click on the plus sign and here we have these 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.090
 full effect but there is a shadow 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.720
 blur 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.310
 glow now she is red so she 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.270
 not seen did tax not what 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.080
 color green will make more quality 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.080
 more powerful 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.490
 and 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.860
 the effect was this effect can be made and 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.850
 internal shadow put the glow and 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.850
 poliram white light 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.569
 Now let's start the animation for more 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:02.989
 convenient site creation take effect 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:04.730
 made skin click here and start 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.030
 create create new frame 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.680
 key optiflame and move our ball 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.349
 so as not to poke every time here 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.879
 click insert keyframe denunciations for 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.569
 creating a new one you can just 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.569
 press of 6 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.860
 So 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.970
 tailors made 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.970
 simple animation 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.940
 now to see everything 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.100
 actions that made onions sometimes to 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.350
 of this we take this one from the bracket and 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:58.030
 so by the very beginning now I understand 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.080
 that the animation on the glass smoothly press 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.770
 control and 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.770
 movie test 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.010
 and we and him that the animation turned out 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.010
 even so we continue to do it 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.750
 for more good animation quality with 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:36.220
 physical properties 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:39.990
 because i press control and test 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.990
 movie and see our video 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.690
 us it turned out a bit slow and 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.960
 so now we will accelerate choose 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:56.340
 frame rate can also be selected in 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:05:01.960
 project settings and write instead of 12 18 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:07.570
 now we run again see what we have 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:10.390
 it turned out smooth animation well in 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.020
 Basically, the whole team was with you 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.289
 fogive 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.569
 and see you soon 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.080
 Now attention in the comments to 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.939
 Past video you wrote that macromedia 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.309
 flash is old is that it is not 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.020
 interesting that is there not to take adob 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:28.240
 flash cs6 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.830
 Well, in fact, the lessons on it will be 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.449
 little field we are now business skills 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.999
 novices therefore called on wide 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.430
 macromedia flash for beginners 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:38.550
 after 5 6 all works will go to water 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.589
 flash drive from the 6th bye 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.300
 so that you too would not be bored as in 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.319
 some ibex I'll show you how to do 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:52.059
 madness animation 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:54.509
