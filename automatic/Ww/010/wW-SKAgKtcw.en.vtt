00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Today we cut a straight pony 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.540
 and that's why we separate the hair first 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.460
 ready in the middle of a hand 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.210
 then we pull a small crest 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.860
 until the ear of our head and that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 We do the same with the others 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
 side so that you have so many hair 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.980
 we then cut for the ponies of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.230
 eyebrow up into it I the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 Hair and clip the rest behind 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 my ear under the same I do 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.829
 again from the other side so much 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.020
 there will be ponies with one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.079
 Flat object can also be a ruler 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 his or a brush I hold that to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.730
 a head and so I see which line 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.789
 all in which hearing my quasi pony 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.000
 it also has to cut completely 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.860
 small gradation arises 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.469
 that's not much, but that's fine 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.989
 a lot out and therefore dashing the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 just like you look like the brush 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.930
 is above 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.549
 I'm using a fringe knife this time 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 of a rancel do not scissors so 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.799
 not a normal scissors but a the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 from french just to be safe 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 that the hair cut slowly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 just cut 1 centimeter 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.610
 away I'll do you look down again 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.200
 They cover my eyes so I have to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 again, and that's why I cut 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.880
 again about 1 and a half 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 inches away, always in front of the hair 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 comb because you do not want unequal 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.880
 cut and preferably a centimeter 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 cut each time because otherwise can 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 Of course it will be too short if I am 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.159
 if you suddenly cut it too much 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.220
 actually just needs to courage 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.020
 you have to cut every time for pony 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.820
 and as I always say a pony grows 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.680
 very fast, do not worry 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.280
 ensure worst fallback to you the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.290
 side so with my razor he 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 I deserve the tips because I 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.890
 I do not really like dense ponies 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 does not know why that is perhaps 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.960
 because I have too many hair and I like it 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.020
 if you like a little 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.940
 more often are a bit easier 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.590
 fall 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.600
 I usually earn my hair 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.930
 but I do not deserve the ponies 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.170
 Funnily enough, always and now we take 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.580
 the sides that we behind the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.170
 Ear have done before and goal is one 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.880
 I can leave it that way, too 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.319
 It's not that bad but I like it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:40.900
 rather if there is a small curve afterwards 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:44.230
 forms down and so you cut 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.060
 Just take your hair off you 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.480
 just as far as you are short 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.670
 wants 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.510
 I just like to speak a round 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.910
 if you wanted to see in detail how to do it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.310
 hair cuts so to speak a pony 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.200
 would cut with a razor 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.660
 I recommend you look at it 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.880
 video at the end of my i left that 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.340
 once here and once at the end of the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.620
 this video i also left once 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.950
 So that you learn how to pony 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.060
 cuts with a razor and that 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.600
 is easy 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.269
 then the hair is released again 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.820
 Loosens up the whole well and looks 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.540
 So I still think the ponies too 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.549
 That's why I almost come with my 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.709
 razor down and thus ver.di 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.940
 not that far until you 're that kind of 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.519
 end sees it as possible to the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.930
 do not hold razors at an angle 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.459
 completely not completely horizontal to 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.380
 head down but a bit diagonally 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.799
 So you do not have all your hair at once 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.239
 cuts and I would recommend like 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.920
 said if you do not have the other video 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.680
 you have seen that once 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.840
 at least that's how you do it 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.579
 yes, that 's it , I hope, look 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.880
 Thank you very much for it 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.880
