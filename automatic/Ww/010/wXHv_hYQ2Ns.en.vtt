little<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.090> timing<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.960> loop<00:00:13.290> control

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
little bit about timing and loop control

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.019 
little bit about timing and loop control
timing<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.780> refers<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.039> allowing<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
timing is what refers to allowing the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.720 
timing is what refers to allowing the
line<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:19.230> straighten<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.130> front<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.550> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
line to straighten out in front of you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.820 
line to straighten out in front of you
or<00:00:20.939> behind<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.720> after<00:00:22.020> you've<00:00:22.529> made<00:00:22.769> your

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
or behind you after you've made your

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.269 
or behind you after you've made your
speed<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.670> stop<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.900> timing<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> just

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
speed up and stop good timing is just

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.880 
speed up and stop good timing is just
when<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> line<00:00:27.019> straightens<00:00:28.019> out<00:00:28.170> before<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
when the line straightens out before you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.710 
when the line straightens out before you
initiate<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> next<00:00:29.789> part<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> cast<00:00:30.420> so

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
initiate the next part of the cast so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.560 
initiate the next part of the cast so
forward<00:00:31.199> straight<00:00:31.560> back<00:00:32.250> straight<00:00:32.570> forward

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
forward straight back straight forward

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.830 
forward straight back straight forward
straight<00:00:34.010> good<00:00:35.010> timing<00:00:35.550> means<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> line

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
straight good timing means that the line

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
straight good timing means that the line
and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.380> leader<00:00:37.590> has<00:00:38.040> straightened<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and the leader has straightened out in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.709 
and the leader has straightened out in
front<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.260> bad<00:00:40.260> timing

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
front of you bad timing

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.529 
front of you bad timing
results<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> bad<00:00:43.110> cast<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.059> start<00:00:45.360> too

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
results in a bad cast so if I start too

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.790 
results in a bad cast so if I start too
soon<00:00:46.640> all<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.030> line<00:00:48.239> jams<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> air<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
soon all the line jams up in the air and

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
soon all the line jams up in the air and
it<00:00:49.980> doesn't<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.399> very<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:51.690> too

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it doesn't go very well if I start too

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.400 
it doesn't go very well if I start too
late<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> line<00:00:54.090> falls<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> water<00:00:54.960> behind

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
late the line falls to the water behind

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.240 
late the line falls to the water behind
me<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.969> results<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.149> poor<00:00:57.360> cast<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> good

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
me and results in a poor cast so good

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670 
me and results in a poor cast so good
timing<00:00:59.730> again<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.809> waiting<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
timing again is just waiting for the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
timing again is just waiting for the
line<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.280> leader<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.730> straighten

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
line and the leader to straighten

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
line and the leader to straighten
completely<00:01:03.629> before<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.140> before<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
completely before you before you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.880 
completely before you before you
initiate<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> next<00:01:05.519> part<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:06.000> cast<00:01:06.890> loop

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
initiate the next part of your cast loop

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.480 
initiate the next part of your cast loop
control<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> lot<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.900> timing<00:01:10.490> loop

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
control has a lot to do with timing loop

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.750 
control has a lot to do with timing loop
control<00:01:11.939> uses<00:01:12.420> timing<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:14.130> initiate<00:01:14.610> your

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
control uses timing to initiate your

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.890 
control uses timing to initiate your
stroke<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.110> arc<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:17.250> stroke

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
stroke and the arc of your stroke

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
stroke and the arc of your stroke
determines<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.140> big<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.830> loop<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
determines how big your loop is going to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.870 
determines how big your loop is going to
be<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> start<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> 45<00:01:23.460> degree<00:01:23.490> angle

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
be so if you start at a 45 degree angle

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.070 
be so if you start at a 45 degree angle
going<00:01:24.420> forward<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> 45<00:01:26.189> degree<00:01:26.220> angle<00:01:26.549> going

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
going forward to a 45 degree angle going

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.390 
going forward to a 45 degree angle going
back<00:01:28.970> you'll<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> fairly<00:01:30.630> narrow<00:01:30.840> loop<00:01:31.400> if

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
back you'll get a fairly narrow loop if

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.819 
back you'll get a fairly narrow loop if
you<00:01:32.670> drop<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.329> hand<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.990> either<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.560> forward

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you drop your hand on either the forward

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
you drop your hand on either the forward
or<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.369> cast<00:01:35.869> you'll<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> big

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
or the back cast you'll get a big

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.569 
or the back cast you'll get a big
wide-open<00:01:38.030> loop<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.100> make<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.310> stops

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
wide-open loop so make your stops

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.679 
wide-open loop so make your stops
precise<00:01:42.229> 45<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.710> you'll<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> nice<00:01:45.030> tight

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
precise 45 and you'll get a nice tight

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.440 
precise 45 and you'll get a nice tight
loop<00:01:46.520> there's<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.759> more<00:01:47.909> loop<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> should

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
loop there's one more loop you should

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
loop there's one more loop you should
know<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.750> which<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> recognize<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
know about which you recognize when you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.730 
know about which you recognize when you
see<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.479> called<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.020> crossed<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
see it it's called a crossed or a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.429 
see it it's called a crossed or a
tailing<00:01:53.310> loop<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.210> from<00:01:54.450> an<00:01:54.570> unsafe

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
tailing loop and that's from an unsafe

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.490 
tailing loop and that's from an unsafe
location<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> power<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:57.000> start<00:01:57.299> too<00:01:57.509> soon<00:01:57.540> you

location of power you start too soon you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 
location of power you start too soon you
start<00:01:58.560> too<00:01:59.009> hard<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.640> what<00:02:00.149> happens<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
start too hard and what happens is that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.859 
start too hard and what happens is that
throws<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> sine<00:02:01.770> wave<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.640> line<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
throws a sine wave in the line and it

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
throws a sine wave in the line and it
results<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.439> big<00:02:04.619> old<00:02:04.860> tangle<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.670> see
