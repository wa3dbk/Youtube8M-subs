00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.950
 I'm going to teach you how to change the crystal 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.139
 of the s5 the truth is that it is nothing 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.540
 complicated is very easy not even what 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.730
 you have to open here as you can see 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.550
 this crystal is broken 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 it's a bit complicated when it 's 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.590
 broken by the pieces that do not rise towards 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.430
 inside as you can see here we have the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.680
 frame we have the crystal the eye crystal 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 comes with some marked circles 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.830
 that's what that tells us is going 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 towards the part towards the lens if by 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:42.080
 inside the other part comes with a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.080
 plastic goes out of that part 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.810
 some kits come with 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.250
 well they come complete with the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.490
 tool and generates tools varies 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.980
 the price here this also comes with the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.270
 ribbon with which we are going to join the crystal 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.270
 to the phone's casing 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.000
 ok the first thing I recommend is that 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.690
 let's leave the tape to the glass 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.690
 of the telephone 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.290
 this more than anything for the mere 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.630
 We do not support each other and walk like 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.140
 loquitos there trying to stick it and what 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.890
 let's do wrong now if the frame the frame 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.980
 we are going to remove it, I recommend that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.200
 do the corners start at the 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.310
 corners and then they'll be towards the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.990
 center 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.630
 do it without fear as it is a 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.060
 Plastic tool does not mistreat for 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.810
 nothing the case if they use something else that does not 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.990
 be plastic some metal this have 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.300
 be careful not to mistreat here 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 As you can see, the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.010
 we remove 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.110
 and what remains of glue 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.800
 It is very easy to remove simply 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 poplars 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.110
 it does not break is easy to remove 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 and now with the other part of 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.020
 tools if you do not have this can 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.660
 use a guitar nail or they can 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.330
 cut out a plastic to do it 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.240
 faster 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.860
 and we remove all the glass is stuck 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.010
 Almost entirely 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.240
 ok in this case as it is broken there are 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.880
 be careful not to go towards 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.360
 inside the crystals now if what 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.940
 it remains of glue it is necessary to remove it little 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.520
 to little and finally I recommend that 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.640
 use cotton and alcohol to remove 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.260
 completely the glue now if 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.510
 we proceed to remove the cover and paste 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.590
 what has been the crystal towards the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.590
 phone shell 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 here you can see the marks 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.000
 of the circles that I tell them and that's where 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.430
 Lets put 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 the glue 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.620
 before they place it clean well 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.750
 inside 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.810
 and outside if they want too but 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.180
 mainly inside since if 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.580
 you clean if you do not clean it before 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.580
 to put it is going to look very opaque 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.989
 ok I recommend you to press and what 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:26.450
 make up a pillow so that in 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.840
 the moment of pressing the glass does not 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.840
 break 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.530
 now let's put the frame the frame 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.970
 it comes with its protectors 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.940
 one on the outside and one on the inside 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.460
 ok as you can see it already comes with the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.760
 glue just to join in this 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:53.430
 part of here comes a chair or a guide 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.120
 that same guide comes in our framework 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.989
 as you can see 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.470
 I recommend that you first put the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.319
 part of the cgr of the capo and after 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.140
 place it in its entirety once 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.310
 we already put it, we started to press little 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.569
 little by the edges to make it a 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.569
 we correctly clean 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.440
 and how can they see her? 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.980
 literally here in this step I already know 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.800
 everything ends and it's just a matter 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.360
 to clean it well press well in case 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.360
 it does not sound good 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.080
 that would be everything as you can see 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.230
 it was not difficult and complicated 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.140
 the opposite is very easy 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.480
 and we did not even need to open 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.610
 the phone we simply remove the 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.389
 back cover and it was all 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.560
 ok as you can see here that nothing else 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.460
 put the back cover 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.850
 has to unite well 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.210
 so that we realize that 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.930
 indeed it was well placed 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.280
 well that was all do not forget 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.520
 subscribe you 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.860
 share the video give a like 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
 thanks for watching the video we're 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.949
 seeing any questions or suggestions 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.949
 here we walk take care
