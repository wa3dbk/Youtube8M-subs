technology to keep it raw and safe for
consumption<00:00:40.559> which<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.920> called<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> high

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
consumption which is called a high

consumption which is called a high
pressure<00:00:41.579> processing<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:42.540> means<00:00:42.750> we

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
pressure processing which means we

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.209 
pressure processing which means we

expose it to high levels of pressure

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.410 
expose it to high levels of pressure
externally<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.879> inhibiting<00:00:48.329> the

coconut water is a very delicate product

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.560 
coconut water is a very delicate product
to<00:01:03.870> work<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.650> low<00:01:05.430> acid<00:01:05.880> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to work with because it's low acid so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
to work with because it's low acid so
it's<00:01:06.689> very<00:01:06.780> similar<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> dairy<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.280> number

it's very similar to dairy in a number
of<00:01:08.549> ways<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:09.540> means<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> hotbed<00:01:10.200> for

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of ways which means it's a hotbed for

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
of ways which means it's a hotbed for
bacterial<00:01:11.040> growth<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
bacterial growth and that's what all the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.280 
bacterial growth and that's what all the
other<00:01:12.000> brands<00:01:12.420> cook<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.810> boil<00:01:13.080> and

other brands cook it boil and
pasteurized<00:01:13.770> heat<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> keeping<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> raw<00:01:15.030> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pasteurized heat it keeping it raw is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.640 
pasteurized heat it keeping it raw is
not<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> sake<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.049> keeping<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.530> raw

not just for the sake of keeping it raw

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
not just for the sake of keeping it raw
it<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:17.159> changes<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> lot<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> profile

have that true fresh coconut experience
more<00:01:45.880> importantly<00:01:46.329> you're<00:01:46.509> metabolizing<00:01:47.259> all

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
more importantly you're metabolizing all

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.749 
more importantly you're metabolizing all
of<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.590> great<00:01:47.799> stuff<00:01:47.979> that's<00:01:48.189> inside<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.520> a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
of the great stuff that's inside of a

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.639 
of the great stuff that's inside of a
much<00:01:49.000> higher<00:01:49.179> rate<00:01:49.420> so<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:50.439> makes<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
much higher rate so really makes the

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.050 
much higher rate so really makes the
difference<00:01:50.799> for<00:01:51.009> your<00:01:51.100> body<00:01:51.310> as<00:01:51.490> well<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:51.939> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
difference for your body as well so the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.279 
difference for your body as well so the
reason<00:01:52.329> we're<00:01:52.450> more<00:01:52.569> expensive<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.079> pretty

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
reason we're more expensive is pretty

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.080 
reason we're more expensive is pretty
simple<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:53.709> mean<00:01:53.859> we're<00:01:53.979> 20%<00:01:54.549> more<00:01:54.609> expensive

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
simple I mean we're 20% more expensive

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.459 
simple I mean we're 20% more expensive
and<00:01:55.149> we're<00:01:55.299> not<00:01:55.359> doing<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.719> as<00:01:55.869> price<00:01:56.109> cream

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
and we're not doing that as price cream

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:57.990 
and we're not doing that as price cream
because<00:01:56.770> we're<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.009> higher-end<00:01:57.579> brand<00:01:57.819> we're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
because we're a higher-end brand we're

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.399 
because we're a higher-end brand we're
just<00:01:58.149> doing<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.509> because<00:01:58.600> you're<00:01:58.990> actually

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
just doing it because you're actually

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.719 
just doing it because you're actually
purchasing<00:01:59.859> something<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.219> costs<00:02:00.579> much

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
purchasing something that costs much

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.160 
purchasing something that costs much
more<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:01.000> make<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.479> you're<00:02:01.599> getting<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.869> small

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
more to make and you're getting a small

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.229 
more to make and you're getting a small
wild<00:02:02.439> coconut<00:02:03.039> that's<00:02:03.189> preserved<00:02:03.700> raw

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
wild coconut that's preserved raw

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.210 
wild coconut that's preserved raw
throughout<00:02:04.899> its<00:02:05.079> whole<00:02:05.289> life<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.829> delivered

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
throughout its whole life and delivered

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.669 
throughout its whole life and delivered
to<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.909> flipside<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.599> you<00:02:07.840> know<00:02:07.959> sure

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
to you the flipside is you know sure

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.410 
to you the flipside is you know sure
it's<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.979> smaller<00:02:09.310> size<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:09.819> sure<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.329> more

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
it's a smaller size and sure it's more

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.759 
it's a smaller size and sure it's more
expensive<00:02:10.599> but<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.079> nutrition<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.709> the

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
expensive but the nutrition and the

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.339 
expensive but the nutrition and the
experience<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.579> much<00:02:12.640> greater<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.360> I'm<00:02:13.840> of

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
experience is so much greater so I'm of

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.920 
experience is so much greater so I'm of
the<00:02:14.379> belief<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.739> less<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.340> best<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:16.510> our<00:02:16.690> case

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the belief that less is best in our case

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
the belief that less is best in our case
and<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.620> get<00:02:18.069> one<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.400> ours<00:02:18.579> versus

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and you know get one of ours versus

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.039 
and you know get one of ours versus
three<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.329> the<00:02:19.420> others<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.840> you're<00:02:19.959> probably

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
three of the others and you're probably

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.900 
three of the others and you're probably
gonna<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.530> better<00:02:20.769> experience<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> lot

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
gonna have a better experience so a lot

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.490 
gonna have a better experience so a lot
of<00:02:21.940> people<00:02:22.120> ask<00:02:22.420> us<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:22.959> how<00:02:23.170> come<00:02:23.349> your

purple<00:02:36.459> or<00:02:36.519> yellow<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:37.299> fact<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.500> our

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
purple or yellow the fact is some of our

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.170 
purple or yellow the fact is some of our
coconuts<00:02:38.980> dude<00:02:39.190> coconut<00:02:39.670> water<00:02:39.700> dude<00:02:40.000> turned

there's<00:03:13.420> no<00:03:13.540> way<00:03:13.659> around<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.049> our<00:03:14.260> packaging

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
there's no way around it our packaging

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.949 
there's no way around it our packaging
is<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> polyethylene<00:03:15.609> one<00:03:16.239> which<00:03:16.480> means<00:03:16.749> it's

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
is a polyethylene one which means it's
