are<00:00:55.559> savvy<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.280> see<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.760> these

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
are savvy they see that these

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.700

organizations have a passion for

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
organizations have a passion for
victimization<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> comes<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
victimization but when it comes to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.280 
victimization but when it comes to
prioritizing<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:02.090> an<00:01:03.090> agenda<00:01:03.930> against

Islam<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> Islamism<00:01:07.260> there's<00:01:08.100> no<00:01:08.310> passion<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
Islam and Islamism there's no passion so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
Islam and Islamism there's no passion so
I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.750> they're<00:01:10.200> using<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.770> our<00:01:10.890> bandwidth

for<00:01:11.909> their<00:01:12.060> own<00:01:12.180> agenda<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.750> exploiting<00:01:13.470> what

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
for their own agenda and exploiting what

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.310

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is a sacred time to really drive deeper

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.490 
is a sacred time to really drive deeper

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
Arab Americans and Muslims I think this

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
Arab Americans and Muslims I think this
war<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.450> terrorism<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.619> become<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> new

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
war on terrorism has become a new

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.219 
war on terrorism has become a new
McCarthyism<00:01:39.119> against<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> community<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
McCarthyism against the community and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.030 
McCarthyism against the community and
the<00:01:40.979> only<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.820> fight<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.619> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the only way that we can fight this is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.609 
the only way that we can fight this is
to<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.579> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.060> understand<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.020> know

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619

anything wrong with cares call okay how

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.340 
anything wrong with cares call okay how
about<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.149> also<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
about this then also do you think this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
about this then also do you think this
might<00:01:55.590> make<00:01:55.770> airline<00:01:56.280> officials<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
might make airline officials and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.249 
might make airline officials and
passengers<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.630> less<00:01:57.810> inclined<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
passengers a bit less inclined to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
investigate a report any suspicious
behavior<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.869> they're<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> be

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
behavior because they're going to be

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.859 
behavior because they're going to be
afraid<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.979> lawsuits<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.000> protests<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.750> all

afraid of lawsuits and protests and all

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.330 
afraid of lawsuits and protests and all
that<00:02:04.020> comes<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.710> mean<00:02:04.829> does<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that comes with it I mean does this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.180 
that comes with it I mean does this
become<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> safety<00:02:06.270> concern<00:02:06.560> no<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.979> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
become a safety concern no I think that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
become a safety concern no I think that
there's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> need<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.270> safety<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.140> need

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
there's a need for a safety and a need

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.460 
there's a need for a safety and a need
to<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:11.220> vigilant<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.510> also<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
to be vigilant but I also think that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
to be vigilant but I also think that
there<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> need<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> protect<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.550> civil

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the United States how about this duty if

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510 
the United States how about this duty if
people<00:02:18.900> become<00:02:19.410> afraid<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.830> complain<00:02:20.250> do<00:02:20.430> you
