00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.610
 Hello dear viewers all 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.810
 hello there is a little information useful 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.380
 about moving to poland 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.110
 and communication with the work here we turned 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.270
 girl on e-mail 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.660
 asked the situation as it is possible 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.800
 say classic is very similar to 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.770
 typing others read yes you writes 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.419
 girl i found a job to poland now 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.190
 contracting but most likely they 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.420
 usually give an invitation well in the sense 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:42.220
 sensations for a semi-annual girlâ€™s visa 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.350
 child husband and the question is 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.060
 can i come with them to poland and 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.250
 apply for a temporary residence card and at the same time 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.970
 attach husband and child there 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.910
 filing because they will be able to give more 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.370
 just a Schengen visa is short 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.470
 because this is the first visa like this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.059
 how about the situation 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.770
 step on the glow based on the same 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.600
 visa treatments 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.130
 with the right to work half a year 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.399
 this is not the most important thing because the main thing 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.700
 then in this situation as far as 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:22.420
 A signed labor contract with 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 the employer if he signs with you 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.569
 contract for more than three months you 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.710
 In this case, you can immediately apply to 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.069
 visit card 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.159
 you got this card stay 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.560
 can apply for the card 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.970
 stay 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 husband and child if 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.530
 the employer will sign will want to sign 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.720
 you not only for three months labor 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.240
 Well, how would contract a probationary period and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.610
 Only after this period an example 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.840
 decision decision to sign an agreement 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.600
 extend this contract 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.820
 then in that case immediately issue a card 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.460
 the temporary residence will not work so well right 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.250
 ask the employer to sign the contract 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 for the long term explain the situation 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.470
 as if all people can but someone will go 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.400

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.630
 Well, right away for a long time, he seems to be but 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 does not commit grain to anything even if 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.450
 something there is wrong employer in any 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.190
 moment can break off the knife
