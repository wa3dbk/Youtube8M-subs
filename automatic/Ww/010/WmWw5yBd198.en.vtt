00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.399 
believe this one being black plum which
is<00:01:23.140> purple<00:01:23.500> red<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:23.860> then<00:01:24.280> white<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:25.630> think<00:01:26.320> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
is purple red and then white I think the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.899 
is purple red and then white I think the
black<00:01:26.590> one<00:01:26.740> obviously<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.520> black<00:01:27.670> one<00:01:27.790> looks

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
black one obviously the black one looks

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.640 
black one obviously the black one looks
like<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.720> white<00:01:28.900> one<00:01:29.110> has<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.320> silver

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
like this but the white one has a silver

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.039 
like this but the white one has a silver
back<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.520> think<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.880> lining<00:01:31.299> is<00:01:31.420> some

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
back and I think the lining is some

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.810 
back and I think the lining is some
white<00:01:32.380> as<00:01:32.560> well<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:33.159> might<00:01:33.310> want<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.549> check<00:01:33.580> on
