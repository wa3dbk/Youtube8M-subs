today we're going to talk about the
procedures<00:00:02.429> for<00:00:02.730> doing<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.090> typical<00:00:03.360> tune-up

should be replaced as well they're not
always<00:00:51.899> replaced<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.860> they're

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
always replaced just if they're

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.479 
always replaced just if they're
suspected<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.750> sort<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> problem

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.970 
suspected to have some sort of a problem
the<00:00:56.489> procedure<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.239> proceeds<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> replacing

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the procedure then proceeds to replacing

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.729 
the procedure then proceeds to replacing

valve<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:16.259> also<00:01:16.590> typically<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.280> replaced

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
valve would also typically be replaced

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.410 
valve would also typically be replaced
at<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.270> time<00:01:19.430> then<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.640> proceed<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
at this time then we proceed to the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.429 
at this time then we proceed to the
actual<00:01:21.750> tuning<00:01:22.680> part<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.670> tune-up<00:01:24.439> the

actual tuning part of a tune-up the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.749 
actual tuning part of a tune-up the
vehicle<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> started<00:01:27.560> brought<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.860> normal

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
vehicle is started brought to normal

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
vehicle is started brought to normal
engine<00:01:30.299> operating<00:01:30.840> temperature<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:32.250> we

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
engine operating temperature and then we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.780 
engine operating temperature and then we
can<00:01:32.520> begin<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> adjustments

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
can begin to make the adjustments

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.330 
can begin to make the adjustments
typically<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.420> first<00:01:36.450> adjustment<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:38.100> ends

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
typically the first adjustment that ends

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.429 
typically the first adjustment that ends
up<00:01:38.400> being<00:01:38.640> made<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.210> setting<00:01:40.200> ignition<00:01:40.710> timing

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
up being made is setting ignition timing

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
up being made is setting ignition timing
after<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> ignition<00:01:43.890> timing<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.490> been<00:01:44.759> set

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
after the ignition timing has been set

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.710 
after the ignition timing has been set
then<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.110> proceed<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.119> adjustments<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
then we proceed to adjustments of the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.550 
then we proceed to adjustments of the
carburetor<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.829> has<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.930> which<00:01:51.930> time<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
carburetor if it has one which time it

carburetor if it has one which time it
is<00:01:52.710> started<00:01:53.040> by<00:01:53.189> setting<00:01:53.640> base<00:01:54.450> idle<00:01:54.840> speed

is started by setting base idle speed

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.499 
is started by setting base idle speed
then<00:01:57.360> proceeding<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.399> adjust<00:01:59.399> idle<00:01:59.850> mixture

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.249 

rechecking<00:02:03.509> idle<00:02:03.899> speed<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.810> then<00:02:06.810> checking

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
rechecking idle speed and then checking

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.450 
rechecking idle speed and then checking
fast<00:02:07.590> idle<00:02:07.860> speed
