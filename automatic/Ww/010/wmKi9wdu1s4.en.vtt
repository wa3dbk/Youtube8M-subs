00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 The world's smallest micro helicopter! KYOSHO mosquito 

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:06.401
 And what are I doing now? that is 

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.234
 This helicopter has a tendency to fly right to front right 

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.401
 If you do nothing, this will make a flight like this 

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:25.767
 See you! This helicopter will go to the right front to the right 

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:38.467
 I do not touch the right lever, it is just the throttle adjustment of the left lever 

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.201
 So, if I weight the left side of the aircraft, would it fly well? I thought 

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.734
 Again, this is Yoda, not Droid! 

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.267
 By the way, why is he in Santa Claus? 

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.701
 Moreover, he carries a strange thing on his back 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.867
 For now, this is too big, so just use the neck 

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.734
 Is it like this? 

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:06.034
 Is it kinda creepy? 

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:14.467
 I put it with double-sided tape 

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:20.867
 If only the neck falls, it still feels creepy 

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:32.167
 It's almost like this, it's easy to install 

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.801
 Paste on the left side of the machine, and a little behind! 

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:48.101
 It's done! 

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:55.467
 Let's start flying! May the force be with you! 

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:06.534
 I hovered! 

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:13.401
 As it is Jedi Master, he exerts such a force even with his neck alone 

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:22.401
 that? Hey, was the left side too heavy? 

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:31.401
 But it is easier to maneuver than when nothing is done 

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:48.934
 However, this helicopter is still moving up and down violently ... 

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:56.867
 After all this throttle is difficult to operate 

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:03.801
 I'm calm now! Yoda's Up! 

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:13.467
 It was a little more, sorry 

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:28.467
 By the way, because the cause of this phenomenon is due to individual differences 

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:36.067
 Usually I think that I will fly normally without using Force 

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:48.667
 I'm in good shape, so I'll try landing! 

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:53.201
 Failure! 

00:03:55.934 --> 00:04:02.601
 Challenge landing once more! 

00:04:21.134 --> 00:04:23.034
 now! go! 

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:26.167
 Safely, landing
