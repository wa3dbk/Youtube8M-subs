00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because when you make this batter you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.690 
because when you make this batter you
want<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> batter<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:41.009> slightly<00:01:41.490> thicker

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
want the batter to be slightly thicker

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.639 
want the batter to be slightly thicker
not<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.360> those<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.750> better<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:43.530> bit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
not like those are better little bit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
not like those are better little bit
coarse<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> thicker<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.750> at<00:01:45.869> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
coarse and thicker now look at this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.980 
coarse and thicker now look at this
batter<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.100> course<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:48.810> we

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
batter this is course this is what we

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
batter this is course this is what we
use<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.439> make<00:01:49.590> fantastic<00:01:50.430> arise<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.020> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you know not thin like those are but

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.760 
you know not thin like those are but
slightly<00:02:04.710> thicker<00:02:05.219> look<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.770> that

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
slightly thicker look at this that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.510 
slightly thicker look at this that
should<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.069> good<00:02:08.250> enough

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
should be good enough

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
should be good enough

traditionally they spread this with the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.290 
traditionally they spread this with the
hand<00:02:10.590> by<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.430> wetting<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> hand<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and spread it after spreading it just

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.170 
and spread it after spreading it just
add<00:02:16.430> some<00:02:16.760> oil<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.360> top<00:02:17.570> but<00:02:18.940> what<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
going to make holes in the right there

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.910 
going to make holes in the right there
are<00:02:56.060> rules<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.630> making<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.110> holes<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.709> make

are rules in making the holes you make
one<00:02:58.250> hole<00:02:58.459> never<00:02:58.850> two<00:02:59.150> holes<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.870> make<00:03:00.080> three

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
one hole never two holes you make three

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.160 
one hole never two holes you make three
holes<00:03:00.440> never<00:03:00.830> four<00:03:01.160> holes<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:01.940> always<00:03:02.390> odd
