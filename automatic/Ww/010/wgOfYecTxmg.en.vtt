00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.260
 hello friends this is a simple but valuable tutorial that you make in order to 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.810
 learn and teach those who follow a preparation in this area of ​​the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.670
 genetic there were other careers that need genetics like me 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.109
 this time I will explain how to distinguish each of the chromosomes 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.390
 of the carioca loves shot with a technique called to collect 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.640
 we started with the first group the pa chromosome 1 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.980
 is the largest of the complement 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.900
 in the short arm near the merlo center usually presents two bands and the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.290
 The rest of the arm appears with a clearer stain due to absence of bands 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380
 chromosome 2 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.990
 It is its central goal and it is distinguished because both arms have many bands 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 what makes it seem quite dangerous 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.830
 chromosome 3 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.770
 is the smallest of the group is the most central goal and its two arms are very 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.950
 similar in bucket or 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.270
 we continue with the group on chromosome 4 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.240
 It is distinguished because the long arm has several bands and usually appears 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.530
 quite dangerous 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.790
 chromosome 5 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.390
 has a band on the short arm and on the long arm approximately at 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.090
 half presents a most feared block due to the joining of several bands 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.440
 we continue with the group 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.520
 chromosome 6 is sometimes confused with those of the corner group a short arm 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.860
 with a distal band between the mining center and that band there is an area of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.350
 very weak fiction 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 in the long arm we can observe several bands 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.910
 chromosome 7 is similar to the previous one it has a distant band in the arm 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.180
 short but distinguished in the 6 in that in the long arm presents two bands 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.550
 very clear and defined 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.380
 Chromosome 8 is one of the most difficult to distinguish, depending on the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.030
 staining more specifically from its contrast bands may appear in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.150
 long arm 1 the easiest thing is to leave it to the end when you have 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.359
 solved the remaining chromosomes of the group 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.739
 chromosome 9 are distinguished very well because it has an interstitial band 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.769
 quite large in the short arm and two very sharp bands in office 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.280
 Chromosome 10 is the simplest to determine since it is the only one 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:28.349
 group that has three very clear bands on the long arm being the most 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.439
 next to the center number more intense than the other two 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.709
 chromosome 11 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.400
 in the short arm it presents a band and a very feared block towards the middle of the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.199
 long arm or interspersed 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.299
 as soma 12 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.449
 it looks like chromosome 11 but the long arm band of chromosome 12 is 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.329
 closer to the medical center 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.379
 compared to chromosome 11 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.569
 we continue with the group 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.779
 chromosome 13 presents a band near the center die the short arm and then 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.599
 two bands that sometimes appear together in the most distal area in the long arm 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:12.849
 chromosome 14 has two bands on the long arm one near the center I die and 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.179
 another one farther away from it but without being as distant as those of the 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.119
 chromosome 13 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:24.329
 Chromosome 15 is distinguished because it has a band towards the middle of the arm 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.579
 also the proximal half of the arm appears more feared than the distal half 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:35.389
 we continue with group l chromosome 16 is the largest central meta south of 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.229
 the small ones usually appear quite clear or presenting some band in the 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:41.719
 long arm 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:47.309
 chromosome 17 is more its centric goal than the 16th and it presents a band 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.079
 in the long arm 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.090
 Chromosome 18 is the one with the smallest short arm in the group and presents 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.589
 two bands on the long arm 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.879
 we continue with the group efe 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.449
 chromosome 19 does not present any band in any of the arms as 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.939
 sonic 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.119
 chromosome 20 has a band on the short arm 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.179
 we continue with the group g 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:15.379
 this group is perhaps the most famous because it has the most chromosomes 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.180
 small and by their presence in the most frequent alterations of the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.669
 human species 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.080
 To distinguish one chromosome pair from another one has to look at the different 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.680
 staining of the periz area entered medical 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.240
 Chromosome 21 has a dark cornered-looking band that does not 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.770
 is present in the 22 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.130
 chromosome 22 sometimes has a band towards the middle of the long arm 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.960
 finally the sex chromosomes xp i 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.680
 the x chromosome has a band on the short arm and a band on the arm 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.970
 long these bands are equidistant to the mere center 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.979
 chromosome i is perhaps the easiest to see because you can see it completely 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.490
 danger 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 that's all for today I hope you have served this tutorial 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.729
 Thank you
