00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.310
 May I help you? 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 I'm looking for someone to take part in an adventure. 

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.640
 Adventure? 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.110
 Yeah. A 3-D adventure of 48 frames per second. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 Stone giants, shooting giants and scrotum (in the form of a testicle bag) ... 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.310
 ... full of goblin kings with a beard. 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.760
 Excuse me, did you say scrotum beards? 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.860
 SKROTUM STORES! 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 11,12. That makes 13. 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.440
 Where's Bilbo? 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.540
 He left us! We will never see our Hobbit again! 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.600
 He's already gone! 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 No, he is not gone! I'm here! 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.520
 Oh! 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.260
 Well, it's ... it's weird. 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.080
 How did you get past those goblins? 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.180
 You know, you know. It's not a big deal. 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 I just... 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.930
 ... I passed them. 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.930
 Yeah... 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.240
 What was that? 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.510
 What? What was what? 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.190
 WHAT IS IT? 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.850
 What? Nothing. I did not do anything! 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.950
 You just put something in your pocket. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 Neeee? No! 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.700
 I have not. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.580
 Bilbo, I have a very bad feeling about this. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.420
 Now, tell me what's in your pocket! 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 It's weird because the same question had already saved me. 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 I can not believe this! Come with me! 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.220
 Ah! OK! 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.160
 Where are you going? 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 Find a butterfly! Do not worry! 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.510
 But what happens if someone attacks us while you're away? 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.900
 Then climb a tree. How can I know. I'il save you at the last minute. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 We'il be right back! 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.630
 That was very strange. 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.560
 There's an ax in your head. 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 Did you know this? 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.460
 Why don't we just go all this way ?! 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.800
 Throw it to the fire! 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.230
 No! 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.770
 Yeah! 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.310
 No! 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.030
 You throw that ring away in the fire! 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 I don't want to! 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.150
 Bilbo, if you don't fire that ring, I'm gonna have to throw you with that ring! 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.450
 Now, the AT! 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.200
 But he makes me invisible. 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.320
 I love him! 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 One! 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.730
 It's mine! 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 Two! 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.180
 No, you can't make me do this! 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.990
 Three! 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.440
 My precious! 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.370
 And this is-- 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Here. It disappeared. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 I hope we don't need that ring later. 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.820
 Dragon lives! 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.430
 Let her run! 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 Thanks a lot, Gandalf! 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.250
