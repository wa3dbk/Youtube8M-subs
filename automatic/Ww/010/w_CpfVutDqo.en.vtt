00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.170 
now the main feature of this set is this
little<00:02:59.260> piece<00:02:59.470> right<00:02:59.620> here<00:02:59.880> which<00:03:00.880> you're

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
little piece right here which you're

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.810 
little piece right here which you're
supposed<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.650> slam<00:03:02.650> down<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.580> then<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
supposed to slam down on and then the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.640 
supposed to slam down on and then the
vehicles<00:03:04.270> go<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.560> know<00:03:05.710> fast<00:03:07.440> they<00:03:08.440> go<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
vehicles go you know fast they go a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.150 
vehicles go you know fast they go a
decent<00:03:09.280> amount<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.330> distance<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.710> I<00:03:11.920> could

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
decent amount of distance but I could

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.890 
decent amount of distance but I could
probably<00:03:12.340> roll<00:03:12.670> these<00:03:12.880> farther<00:03:13.420> than<00:03:13.690> these

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
probably roll these farther than these

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.260 
probably roll these farther than these
things<00:03:14.170> actually<00:03:14.770> hit<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.130> out<00:03:15.310> even<00:03:16.180> when

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
things actually hit them out even when

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.620 
things actually hit them out even when
you<00:03:16.360> slam<00:03:16.660> them<00:03:16.810> down<00:03:16.990> really<00:03:17.320> hard<00:03:17.410> they<00:03:18.130> go<00:03:18.310> a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
you slam them down really hard they go a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.960 
you slam them down really hard they go a
pretty<00:03:19.890> short<00:03:20.890> distance<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.550> mean<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.790> could

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
pretty short distance I mean you could

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.070 
pretty short distance I mean you could
see<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.360> end<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.800> Lightning<00:03:23.800> McQueen<00:03:23.920> here<00:03:24.430> so

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
see the end of Lightning McQueen here so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.390 
see the end of Lightning McQueen here so
really<00:03:26.080> don't<00:03:26.230> like<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.680> piece<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.100> think

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
really don't like this piece I think

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
really don't like this piece I think
they<00:03:27.489> could<00:03:27.670> have<00:03:27.760> done<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> little<00:03:28.180> bit<00:03:28.360> better

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
they could have done a little bit better

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.040 
they could have done a little bit better
with<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.459> shooting<00:03:30.459> action<00:03:31.060> maybe<00:03:31.630> like<00:03:31.900> an

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
with the shooting action maybe like an

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.860 
with the shooting action maybe like an
actual<00:03:32.610> clicking<00:03:33.610> mechanism<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.450> where<00:03:34.630> this

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
actual clicking mechanism to where this

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.260 
actual clicking mechanism to where this
rubber<00:03:35.680> band<00:03:35.920> would<00:03:36.220> click<00:03:36.489> back<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.760> then

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
rubber band would click back and then

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.630 
rubber band would click back and then
release<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:38.800> did<00:03:38.980> not<00:03:39.070> do<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.340> you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
release but they did not do that you

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.580 
release but they did not do that you
have<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.970> slam<00:03:40.270> down<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.020> doesn't<00:03:41.350> really

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
have to slam down and it doesn't really

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.729 
have to slam down and it doesn't really
slam<00:03:41.890> down<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.910> far<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.630> tried<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.590> the

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
slam down that far I tried it on the

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.740 
slam down that far I tried it on the
ground<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.610> actually<00:03:45.940> roll<00:03:46.150> these<00:03:46.360> a

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
ground and I can actually roll these a

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.790 
ground and I can actually roll these a
heck<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.650> lot<00:03:47.800> farther<00:03:48.600> they<00:03:49.600> run<00:03:50.290> really

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
heck of a lot farther they run really

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.479 
heck of a lot farther they run really
smooth<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.209> it's<00:03:53.080> not<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.530> fact<00:03:53.800> that<00:03:53.950> they

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
smooth so it's not the fact that they

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.490 
smooth so it's not the fact that they
don't<00:03:54.880> roll<00:03:55.209> far<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:55.780> just<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.110> fact<00:03:56.350> that

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
don't roll far it's just the fact that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.940 
don't roll far it's just the fact that
this<00:03:56.880> slamming<00:03:57.880> mechanism<00:03:58.840> does<00:03:59.470> not<00:03:59.680> really

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
this slamming mechanism does not really

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.010 
this slamming mechanism does not really
work<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:01.030> well<00:04:01.680> also<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.700> get<00:04:03.880> three<00:04:04.239> racing

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
work that well also you get three racing

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.670 
work that well also you get three racing
vehicles<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.709> only<00:04:06.270> two<00:04:07.270> of<00:04:07.630> these<00:04:08.080> really<00:04:08.410> bad

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
vehicles in only two of these really bad

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.540 
vehicles in only two of these really bad
Slammers

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
Slammers

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.380 
Slammers
so<00:04:10.150> overall<00:04:10.680> really<00:04:11.730> wish<00:04:12.730> they<00:04:13.090> could<00:04:13.269> have

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
so overall really wish they could have

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.390 
so overall really wish they could have
done<00:04:13.510> without<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.410> really<00:04:15.100> like<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
done without this I really like the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.000 
done without this I really like the
vehicle<00:04:15.790> builds<00:04:16.180> they<00:04:16.330> look<00:04:16.510> really<00:04:16.780> awesome

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
vehicle builds they look really awesome

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.570 
vehicle builds they look really awesome
but<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.390> up<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.750> price<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:21.160> just

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
but this up the price and is just

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.240 
but this up the price and is just
definitely<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.090> worth<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:23.680> does<00:04:23.979> come

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
definitely not worth it it does come

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.279 
definitely not worth it it does come
with<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.430> few<00:04:24.520> stickers<00:04:25.030> these<00:04:25.479> name<00:04:25.900> plates

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
could probably have done without all of

could probably have done without all of
these<00:04:45.110> pieces<00:04:45.849> and<00:04:46.849> stickers<00:04:47.599> they're<00:04:48.139> really

these pieces and stickers they're really
not<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:48.919> important<00:04:49.729> and<00:04:49.849> they<00:04:50.750> could<00:04:51.020> have

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
not that important and they could have

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.680 
not that important and they could have
just<00:04:51.250> has<00:04:52.840> printed<00:04:54.370> version<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.909> flag<00:04:56.270> oh

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
just has printed version of the flag oh

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.680 
just has printed version of the flag oh
I<00:04:57.620> like<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.129> builds<00:04:58.639> of<00:04:58.819> the<00:04:58.849> colors<00:04:59.419> the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
I like the builds of the colors the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.730 
I like the builds of the colors the
vehicles<00:05:00.139> look<00:05:00.289> really<00:05:00.710> nice<00:05:00.919> I<00:05:01.310> like<00:05:01.699> these<00:05:02.030> I

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
vehicles look really nice I like these I

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.159 
vehicles look really nice I like these I
really<00:05:03.789> dislike<00:05:04.789> that<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:05.539> piece<00:05:05.900> right

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
really dislike that this piece right

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.439 
really dislike that this piece right
here<00:05:06.229> just<00:05:06.620> completely<00:05:07.219> breaks<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.669> for<00:05:07.879> me<00:05:08.030> of

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
here just completely breaks it for me of

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.600 
here just completely breaks it for me of
course<00:05:08.569> it<00:05:08.870> comes<00:05:09.020> apart<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.069> you<00:05:10.129> can<00:05:10.280> attach

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
course it comes apart so you can attach

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.930 
course it comes apart so you can attach
them<00:05:10.849> and<00:05:11.500> have<00:05:12.500> more<00:05:12.889> but<00:05:13.520> they<00:05:13.639> should<00:05:13.849> have

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
them and have more but they should have

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.879 
them and have more but they should have
just<00:05:14.120> given<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.419> three<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.080> begin<00:05:15.440> with<00:05:15.650> so

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
just given you three to begin with so

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.529 
just given you three to begin with so
you<00:05:15.949> could<00:05:16.129> actually<00:05:16.490> race<00:05:16.729> all<00:05:17.060> three<00:05:17.419> at

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
you could actually race all three at

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.300 
you could actually race all three at
once

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
once

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.290 
once
so<00:05:19.310> I'm<00:05:19.400> definitely<00:05:19.580> going<00:05:19.849> to<00:05:19.909> have<00:05:20.030> to<00:05:20.060> give

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
so I'm definitely going to have to give

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.140 
so I'm definitely going to have to give
this<00:05:20.479> set<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.990> break<00:05:21.680> it

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.719 

if<00:05:26.110> they<00:05:26.290> would<00:05:26.470> have<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.800> given<00:05:26.949> me<00:05:27.310> this

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
if they would have just given me this

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.189 
if they would have just given me this
right<00:05:28.120> here<00:05:28.600> for<00:05:29.530> about<00:05:30.660> $20<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.870> would<00:05:32.080> have

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
right here for about $20 I would have

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.870 
right here for about $20 I would have
accepted<00:05:32.590> it<00:05:32.889> but<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.190> fact<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.520> they<00:05:33.669> gave

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
accepted it but the fact that they gave

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.140 
accepted it but the fact that they gave
me<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.180> piece<00:05:34.540> and<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:34.990> up<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.729> piece<00:05:36.729> count

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
me this piece and it up the piece count

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.480 
me this piece and it up the piece count
by<00:05:37.570> quite<00:05:37.900> a<00:05:37.930> bit<00:05:38.229> because<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.770> lot<00:05:39.010> of<00:05:39.160> small

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
by quite a bit because a lot of small

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.909 
by quite a bit because a lot of small
pieces<00:05:39.780> it's<00:05:40.780> really<00:05:41.110> not<00:05:41.260> that<00:05:41.530> great<00:05:41.710> of<00:05:41.770> a

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
pieces it's really not that great of a

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.250 
pieces it's really not that great of a
deal<00:05:42.100> as<00:05:42.690> 280<00:05:43.690> pieces<00:05:44.290> it's<00:05:44.500> about<00:05:44.740> $30<00:05:46.260> and

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
deal as 280 pieces it's about $30 and

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.900 
deal as 280 pieces it's about $30 and
probably<00:05:47.680> more<00:05:47.889> than<00:05:47.949> half<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.520> your<00:05:48.639> pieces

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
probably more than half of your pieces

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.469 
probably more than half of your pieces
are<00:05:49.330> in<00:05:49.690> this<00:05:49.900> right<00:05:50.199> here<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:51.360> given<00:05:52.360> the

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
are in this right here and given the

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.230 
are in this right here and given the
fact<00:05:52.780> that<00:05:52.930> most<00:05:53.889> of<00:05:54.130> these<00:05:54.220> vehicles<00:05:54.580> are<00:05:54.910> six

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
fact that most of these vehicles are six

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.930 
fact that most of these vehicles are six
dollars<00:05:55.419> each<00:05:56.220> which<00:05:57.220> would<00:05:57.430> put<00:05:57.639> it<00:05:57.760> at<00:05:57.880> about

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
dollars each which would put it at about

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.870 
dollars each which would put it at about
a<00:05:58.240> $20<00:05:58.990> price<00:05:59.320> range<00:05:59.770> for<00:06:00.039> just<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> vehicles

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
a $20 price range for just the vehicles

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.409 
a $20 price range for just the vehicles
I<00:06:01.530> would<00:06:02.530> have<00:06:02.620> much<00:06:02.830> rather<00:06:03.130> just<00:06:03.310> pay<00:06:03.669> $20

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
I would have much rather just pay $20

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.719 
I would have much rather just pay $20
for<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.690> vehicles<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.380> just<00:06:06.130> scrap<00:06:06.490> this

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
for the vehicles and just scrap this

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.990 
for the vehicles and just scrap this
whole<00:06:06.970> idea<00:06:07.150> all<00:06:07.539> together<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:09.430> was<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.699> nice

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
whole idea all together it was a nice

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.450 
whole idea all together it was a nice
idea<00:06:10.419> it<00:06:10.690> had<00:06:10.840> some<00:06:11.080> nice<00:06:11.260> thought<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.830> it<00:06:11.979> it

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
idea it had some nice thought to it it

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.260 
idea it had some nice thought to it it
was<00:06:12.610> just<00:06:12.789> really<00:06:13.120> poorly<00:06:13.780> executed<00:06:15.030> so<00:06:16.030> this

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
was just really poorly executed so this

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.240 
was just really poorly executed so this
has<00:06:16.360> been<00:06:16.479> another<00:06:16.720> doctor<00:06:17.110> review<00:06:17.440> hope<00:06:18.070> you
