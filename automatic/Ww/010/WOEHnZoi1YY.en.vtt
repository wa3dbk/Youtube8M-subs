00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.719
 on youtube welcome to another floor more 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.789
 from the world thank you plants in this we are going to 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.650
 see a small repetition in which 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:25.310
 choose a theft of a million resources 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.710
 let's go to it let's see first in the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.140
 repression threw two break walls for 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.830
 open the wall after two others and I 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.980
 there are several tests not good when doing this 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.110
 what I did was launch several barbarians 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.910
 barbarians to achieve it destroy and can 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.250
 to enter what happened was that the brothers 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.430
 they are a bit stupid so they went up 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.010
 City Hall destroy it but 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.080
 then of archers to be able to clean 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.990
 the zone above and thus stealing all 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.030
 resources good and at this point what 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.430
 what I did was throw more breaks walls for 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.320
 open that wall here the second wall and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.660
 to be a little closer to the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.220
 central area then a spell of rage and 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.920
 a healing spell to go healing 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.410
 a little the blows to the barbarians and 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.780
 the archers of the mortars and one more 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.430
 we break to open the compartment 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.520
 central and can steal all the resources 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.530
 we take the rival but practically 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.420
 a dead man died 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.190
 and practically already I had more than 60% I 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.479
 destroyed and almost all resources 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.310
 stolen 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.700
 I think I was lucky enough to 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 find this village and the truth was a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.860
 design 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.960
 maybe well structured but that with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.420
 the troops that it was very easy to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.479
 enter and apart that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.880
 the level of troops also that I have is 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.560
 so I 've gone enough to 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 to be able to make this kind of this great room 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.170
 really my idea was not I never thought 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.850
 let me leave everything to zero gold and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.480
 helix but good 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 the truth was very good red 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.180
 when when after having done the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.760
 robbery when I put the repeat for the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.310
 of the clan said he believed me when when 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.250
 and everything he had stolen in that 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.610
 when I steal, I did not think they had 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.530
 been like 800 thousand and then I saw in the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.660
 repetition I realized that it was a 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.670
 million good to see it again a little 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.430
 more carefully so that we can 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.600
 observe well first break walls and 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.910
 then they go 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.210
 barbarians to destroy them tesla and that no 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.740
 I eliminated the archers fast as 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.390
 we do in which practically 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.040
 blows destroy the exchange archers 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.680
 the barbarians that lasted a little longer 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.750
 of time and have more attack then 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.760
 here a couple of goblins to go cleaning 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.550
 today giving to the barbarians that are something 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 slow and we'll finish a two spells of the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.430
 lightning to destroy the mortar and that was 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.620
 maybe it's enough what gave me enough 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.120
 to be able to do this robbery since the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.450
 mortar would not have practically 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.800
 crushed everything and I had destroyed it 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.010
 this usually I do when I'm 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.250
 near 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.980
 from mines or warehouses when 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.680
 they are full and they are all together launched 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.900
 a spell of war of rage and without said 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.170
 that there are many defenses that are not going to 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.569
 totally instruct my troop my 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.150
 archers that what I normally use and 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.970
 it's time to use a spell of 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.819
 healing I throw it to be able to give my 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.730
 troops and you can steal quite a bit more and 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.640
 now that the spells are bought with 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.829
 elixir I think most of us bought 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.540
 enough spells and it does not hurt so much 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.159
 and the first gold was used for 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.139
 to be able to buy equids good here 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.720
 down I launched the castle really not 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:51.139
 I know why I throw it there and in my mind 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.989
 according to what I was going to steal from that comes back 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.209
 this dark elixir punch for 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.000
 I throw it pretty bad and here I 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.489
 reigning to want to steal what little of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.900
 gold that was needed and leave it to zero 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:09.180
 counter this poor player so yes 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.730
 until this attack came 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.730
 It was a million robots girls 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.359
 and if it was enough what steal for me 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.030
 it was so far I think it has been the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.320
 biggest robbery that I've done so nothing 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.770
 this you liked 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.320
 I hope you liked this theft and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.090
 remember if you have such theft 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.130
 Not as well as this one a little bit smaller 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.630
 but a big robbery maybe the most 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.150
 great that you have done please 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.760

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.530
