00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
this but in my opinion there's nothing

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.940 
this but in my opinion there's nothing

by the way I was uh I was going back and

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.100 
by the way I was uh I was going back and
forth<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.360> trying<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.900> get<00:03:34.019> the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
forth you know just trying to get the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.509 
forth you know just trying to get the
steps<00:03:34.410> necessary<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.980> hatch<00:03:35.160> some<00:03:35.400> more

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
steps necessary to hatch some more

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.780 
steps necessary to hatch some more
Bulbasaur<00:03:36.000> eggs<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.950> process<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.610> ran

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
Bulbasaur eggs and in the process I ran

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.240 
Bulbasaur eggs and in the process I ran
into<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> mult<00:03:39.390> race<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.980> was<00:03:41.100> pretty

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
into a mult race and it was pretty

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
into a mult race and it was pretty
awesome<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.600> course<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.959> fled<00:03:43.170> right<00:03:43.380> away

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
awesome but of course it fled right away

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.920 
awesome but of course it fled right away
so<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.799> means<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.160> think<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.480> go<00:03:45.630> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
so it means I think that you can go and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.570 
so it means I think that you can go and
capture<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.250> know<00:03:47.280> now<00:03:47.549> I

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
capture it and it's you know now I

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.699 
capture it and it's you know now I

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
recorded parts of the pokemon x water

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.080 
recorded parts of the pokemon x water
lock<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.830> just<00:04:08.250> haven't<00:04:08.459> been<00:04:08.489> able<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.790> sit

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
lock I just haven't been able to sit

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.850 
lock I just haven't been able to sit
down<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.570> get<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.750> time<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.260> edit<00:04:10.410> them<00:04:10.680> up

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
down and get that time to edit them up

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.710 
down and get that time to edit them up
and<00:04:11.070> then<00:04:11.489> render<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:11.970> out<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.269> upload<00:04:12.600> them

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and then render them out and upload them

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.810 
and then render them out and upload them
so<00:04:12.959> that's<00:04:13.470> why<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.739> one<00:04:14.130> or<00:04:14.250> trades<00:04:14.459> work<00:04:14.670> out

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
so that's why the one or trades work out

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.219 
so that's why the one or trades work out
better<00:04:15.000> because<00:04:15.330> instead<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.810> 30<00:04:16.019> minute

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
better because instead of a 30 minute

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.500 
better because instead of a 30 minute
episode<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.830> takes<00:04:16.979> forever<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.310> render<00:04:17.700> you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510
