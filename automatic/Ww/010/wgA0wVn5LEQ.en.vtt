00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 long after spinoza 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.280
 biologists 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.530
 or naturalists 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.770
 will try to describe what he calls words animates us 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.159
 only defined by affects 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.999
 powers to affect or be infected 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.819
 for example sometimes a diaper will do it for there 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 animal that sucks the blood of the demonstrations 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.940
 he will define this animal on that date by three cases 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.100
 and it's not her fault she only has three 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 but it's already a lot of us paying 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.320
 many people 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.430
 three business 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.530
 the first a light affect 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.530
 in a country at the top of a small branch 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 the second an affective active rolf 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.270
 to fall on the tipa mammal under the branch 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.120
 the third to the caloric party 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850
 calorific 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.189
 I was looking for the area without you on the manifesto 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.340
 the warmer region 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 where he'll be able to get stuck found that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.600
 a world with 3 made only while the little beast in the forest 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 immense that never stops sending excitations of the solicitations of all 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.720
 the sides and as for all and proud but he is deaf from the state steals 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 and ashes affect 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780
 except for those three things the rest of the time she was playing 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.480
 she sleeps 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.110
 so an optimal threshold and a threshold and so badly 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.550
 a maximum threshold to a minimum threshold in the power to be affected 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.720
 not necessarily a very good choice the optimal threshold is as well the small 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 crown more meaning that will die 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.150
 the p threshold so bad minimal it tickles young people who can wait years the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.119
 mammal that will go under 5% 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.000
 such studies 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.770
 which define the bodies 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560
 animals 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.849
 but also the orders 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.540
 park the insects so they are each capable 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.339
 we were melting what we will call
