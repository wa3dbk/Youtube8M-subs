and your weave hair wrapped in the
pattern<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.060> wrapped<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
pattern that I wrapped it in when you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.319 
pattern that I wrapped it in when you
undo<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> natural

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
undo it it's just gonna have a natural

wave<00:01:54.960> pattern<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
wave pattern to it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.020 
wave pattern to it
and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> worry<00:01:56.969> about

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
