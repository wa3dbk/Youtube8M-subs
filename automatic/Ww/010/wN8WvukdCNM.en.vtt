game<00:00:25.980> controller<00:00:26.760> you're<00:00:27.119> curious<00:00:27.330> about<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
game controller you're curious about the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.849 
game controller you're curious about the
type<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> adapter<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:28.170> using<00:00:28.320> take<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> look<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
type of adapter I'm using take a look in

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.470 
type of adapter I'm using take a look in
the<00:00:28.920> bottom<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> corner<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.300> video
