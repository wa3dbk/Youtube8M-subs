 I get changes see how the 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.140
 changes but first I'm going to share 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.100
 a new code is open 2014 pack 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.100
 in case they want it 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.450

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:51.989
 thanks 11 more I'm filling 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.340
 what is to win in lack one for each 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.530
 Once you fill a page they are given 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.690
 give one an envelope more see and fill 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.610
 Cameroon and in Spain 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.890
 as assigned here comes japan 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.840
 Uruguay 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.200
 costa rica then I first focus on 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.350
 fill in the full pages one can 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.060
 check 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.260
 and then I will show you the 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.260
 the album already full 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.630
 that fills us to Italy too 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.470
 I believe that Argentina I need 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.470
 messi and they give me another envelope more 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.880
 nigeria see I have some empty envelopes 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.400
 as you see this emptiness because I do not 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.440
 it suits me I have to focus on filling 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.190
 for example Spain also I have it 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.190
 going to spain 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.800
 and some rare countries like Algeria and others 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.250
 I do not have anything like ruse but that's how I 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.590
 got many envelopes of the trivia 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.970
 just today I started with the tribes so 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.550
 if I did not have more but at least 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.680
 I have five to open tomorrow 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.960
 because they are 510 see there are some that neither 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.030
 I still have little stars that 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.270
 are the ones that I do not have but I prefer 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.409
 change them so that it comes by countries 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.610
 and give me more envelopes 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.610
 here in repeated 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.140
 we choose which ones we change and which 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.210
 We believe that I want anyone to messi 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.640
 win either from bosnia or any 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.420
 logo because also from bosnia I'm going more 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.390
 or less mining 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.370
 It takes three because I hope that you have 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.880
 liked this second part I think that 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.660
 the third to see if there is a new code 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.910
 more tips or I show you the album 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.690
 finished almost 43 percent already know 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.500
 every day 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.180
 eliminated people in the group 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.330
 in the first video you can see the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.300
 password but they must have more than 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.479
 40% to join 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.940
 because that means every day 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.819
 they take their envelopes so I'm network 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.039
 bus and I hope you liked these 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.580
