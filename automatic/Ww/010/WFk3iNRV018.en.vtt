00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 And so people who say, wishing that 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 back with another video this time is not 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.240
 especially because I'm going to talk only about 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.520
 how to reset jec beauty 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.260
 So how's this video going to be? 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 exclusive only to show and explain 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.510
 detail how to reset the works 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.310
 jackson well first will use 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 here are some basic scams to do 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.940
 reset reservation dragon in the corner but I will 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.649
 do show here only we'll go 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.340
 use in the corner that is the ball itself 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:44.160
 colorado x 0 in front x square ball 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.270
 we only started using half a square 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.949
 square triangle and opash freight there to 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.660
 low up and ball and there also use 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.870
 something more important than the army that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.050
 This game here has three versions for 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.880
 back and xk near the snows x that is from 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.549
 half-way backwards and forwards x 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.939
 It is but I think I have what it is that happens 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 this blow is impossible to strike the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.040
 if you use the bar in any 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.200
 of the floor and also raises 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 opponent scoring but why this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.900
 blow 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.670
 now I'm going to give the first one without a bar in 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 second with bar 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.970
 did you realize that you caught the two broke 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.890
 twice the damage beauty and if I take 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.110
 A little while to do the fight happens 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.030
 arrived at the time because the tuxedo is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 up then we have to put 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 next moment, what we give 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.380
 with bar after simba before 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.450
 character is raised when you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.909
 You're lying on the floor so you can 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.580
 the second year without being able to react 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.080
 the only way you can escape it is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.200
 s 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.179
 as pushed by the power of white 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.360
 here is the oba oba oba 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.069
 I will not be able to stay there either, I do not know the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.459
 from the second 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.709
 the second only started to run only now 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.950
 she escapes because I already now 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:27.930
 raised him to jump law for example is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:31.319
 more beauty is and 10 as it is here in the corner 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.120
 updated this blow here the hug to 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.620
 up and ball on the floor and do here with 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.989
 bar for him not to be able to escape as he is 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.120
 where reserve happens because reservation 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.329
 because the character who will make a 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.940
 how and from the second how you already 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.579
 will change the way the opponent's 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.400
 able to escape by moving them 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.140
 just escapes the ex-apprentice reset 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.959
 layer no break 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.130
 you do not have another option so that's why 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.280
 Good reserve because I know I did not have 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.299
 break it will take the man reserve and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.630
 until you go wrong 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.400
 ok you have to base was enough for 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.930
 do what you need at least one 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.370
 bomb to make reservation so let's go 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 To find out, I'll explain later. 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.150
 It came out as reset you saw that you had the 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.400
 first damage and the second was ours 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.340
 process you are not the two damages or 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.530
 either is very good because there have been 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.820
 It will not be able to escape just 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.490
 using it briefly is like a 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.110
 only body divided into two and 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.770
 the character is only for the shelters to 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.560
 escape 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.910
 so this is the reserve so now you 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.860
 you can do this while you are 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.830
 bar for example has 13 neighborhoods I can not 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.750
 keep doing this and that's not muddy 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.440
 pious civilian pack that does not 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.560
 then you will do with bar while 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.810
 there doing this here same as for 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
 power in reserve to a point and 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.010
 goes even when your opponent uses a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.820
 then do here the maximum that 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.650
 I can see is for us with booking 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.650
 several times so let's go 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.060
 So come on, I did the best I could. 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.710
 can and will continue to make booking 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.230
 zetti but it's time that I dropped the 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.120
 The communiquÃ© arrives like fall but they see there 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.440
 what are you doing here is barbada to do? 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.000
 several times while the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.130
 opponent does not wear white right 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.740
 so I'll explain that one more time is going 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.410
 determine the video forward ball 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.650
 x square held down his 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.620
 fashion square if the fall is tightened 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.170
 frame adriano botou at the time 14 years 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.170
 almost new then down and up 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.170
 right ball was the first part then 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.860
 in the first part the robot 32% until then 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.589
 as the room as 30% 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.209
 then after that you will reject with making 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.309
 This is why, from the bottom up 

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:25.709
 and ball will do down behind 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:28.050
 boy finding bar 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:31.319
 Then when you finish up at the 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.989
 jacques cope animation pick up on the floor 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.599
 playing the tambourine on the floor you go 

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:38.339
 square square triangle if 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.969
 Do you think it's easy but lets you? 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:45.119
 keep giving beating on the court for 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.729
 to be able to leave the opponent still in the air 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.679
 for you to finish like the same then I will 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.050
 do the second part now only second 

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:55.129
 part can be here to do the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.129
 matters of law and let's go 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.240
 hence the second part of the train has time 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.180
 right then it was already 30% more 32 like 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.580
 two bars or 62% 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.509
 based on the report may only escape 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.659
 the no breaks 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.750
 so very worth the reservation 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.719
 jec by then this is the second to 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.490
 end the low season supply and 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:26.039
 frame leaving it after I did 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.810
 multiple codes with adriano the plot 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:32.099
 after that, this is how you treat 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.710
 even when God later understood that 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.030
 this here 0 30% 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:43.560
 You can make history too. 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:45.270
 alternating is for example the size of the 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.860
 difference 87 percent 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.969
 Of course in the middle of the desert more 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.590
 people around the right level jumping with 113 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:56.039
 also can understand us what 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.770
 say then this is the ieh the body of 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.509
 jackson will give it to you step by step 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.889
 how to do then it 's just that formerly 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.870
 he can do it several times 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.430
 repeatedly until then you try to do 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.740
 quickly especially physically 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.900
 wants to totally change the body until you 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.629
 catch the morning of the congress so that's it 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.639
