jojoba<00:02:45.820> oil<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.660> really<00:02:47.230> like<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.500> way<00:02:47.620> that

feels<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:48.130> my<00:02:48.160> skin<00:02:48.280> -<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.510> because<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.950> so

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
feels on my skin - but because it's so

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.170 
feels on my skin - but because it's so
expensive<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:53.080> could<00:02:53.290> afford<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.770> and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
expensive and I could afford this and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.210 
expensive and I could afford this and
the<00:02:55.180> olive<00:02:55.480> oil<00:02:55.600> does<00:02:55.840> my<00:02:56.080> skin<00:02:56.320> justice<00:02:57.010> you
