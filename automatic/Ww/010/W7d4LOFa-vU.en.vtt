know how naruto is but you gotta

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.949 
know how naruto is but you gotta
understand<00:02:17.819> they<00:02:17.909> have<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.239> make<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> fighting

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
understand they have to make a fighting

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.199 
understand they have to make a fighting
balanced<00:02:19.439> game<00:02:19.680> before<00:02:20.549> they<00:02:20.760> make<00:02:21.030> an

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
balanced game before they make an

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.569 
balanced game before they make an
accurate<00:02:21.599> show<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.620> think<00:02:22.739> what<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
accurate show you know I think what it

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.429 
accurate show you know I think what it
comes<00:02:23.609> down<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.209> making<00:02:24.540> fair<00:02:24.900> balanced

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
comes down to is making fair balanced

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.949 
comes down to is making fair balanced
mechanics<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:26.939> you<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.359> accuracy

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
mechanics and then you know the accuracy

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.660 
mechanics and then you know the accuracy
comes<00:02:28.170> afterwards<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:29.010> know<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.579> way

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
comes afterwards you know that's the way

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.429 
comes afterwards you know that's the way
I<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.090> anyway<00:02:30.390> I'd<00:02:30.480> rather<00:02:30.659> have<00:02:30.870> I'd
