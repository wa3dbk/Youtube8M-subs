00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.030
 from this this command because we are going to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.070
 to be able to use it on the xbox 360 is worth this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.460

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.820
 it's not like a page here you are 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.820
 seeing 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.700
 the truth that you have many options 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.430
 You can put many many options as 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.759
 seeing a signal from different angles 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.939
 so you see it here you have another 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.039
