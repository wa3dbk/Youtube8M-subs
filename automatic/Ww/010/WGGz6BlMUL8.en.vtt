well you can see it in the video but

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
well you can see it in the video but
there<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.600> lines<00:00:48.809> everywhere<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.440> can

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
there are lines everywhere you can

definitely see it here though in the
water<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.559> most<00:00:52.800> prominent<00:00:53.039> just

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
water where it's most prominent just

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.580 
water where it's most prominent just
these<00:00:53.610> little<00:00:54.539> lines<00:00:54.930> between<00:00:55.289> every<00:00:55.890> block

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
these little lines between every block

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.000 
these little lines between every block
and<00:00:59.660> it<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.809> annoying<00:01:01.050> me<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.890> trying

was<00:01:06.420> looking<00:01:06.540> through<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> Nvidia<00:01:07.670> control

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
was looking through the Nvidia control

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.899 
was looking through the Nvidia control
panel<00:01:09.020> looking<00:01:10.020> at<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> different

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
anti-aliasing settings and I kept trying

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.590 
anti-aliasing settings and I kept trying
it<00:01:16.619> trying<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.340> doing<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.360> settings

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

you<00:01:56.820> need<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.270> first<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.380> all

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
you need to do first of all

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.260 
you need to do first of all
is<00:01:59.570> go<00:02:00.140> into<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.770> driver<00:02:01.070> settings<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:02.000> find

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
is go into the driver settings to find

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.200 
is go into the driver settings to find
the<00:02:02.360> OpenGL<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:03.920> whenever<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.370> open<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:05.180> I

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
the OpenGL now whenever I open that I

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.060 
the OpenGL now whenever I open that I
had<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.480> bit<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.750> trouble<00:02:05.960> because<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.650> says<00:02:06.830> for

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
had a bit of trouble because it says for

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.200 
had a bit of trouble because it says for
me<00:02:07.220> no<00:02:07.490> supported<00:02:07.970> drivers<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:09.770> don't<00:02:10.430> know<00:02:10.550> why

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
me no supported drivers I don't know why

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.580 
me no supported drivers I don't know why
that<00:02:11.540> came<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:11.900> but<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:14.020> common<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.350> guess

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that came up but it's a common I guess

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.480 
that came up but it's a common I guess
with<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:15.950> 8800<00:02:16.760> GT<00:02:16.790> which<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.630> my<00:02:17.780> media<00:02:18.080> card

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
with the 8800 GT which is my media card

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.460 
with the 8800 GT which is my media card
so<00:02:19.490> just<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.630> case<00:02:20.780> you're<00:02:20.960> having<00:02:21.140> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
so just in case you're having this
