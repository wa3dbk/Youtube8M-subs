00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
some level to liver toxicity okay so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.219 
some level to liver toxicity okay so
that's<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> first<00:01:54.450> thing<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> second<00:01:55.079> thing

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that's the first thing the second thing

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
that's the first thing the second thing
is<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.470> stimulates<00:01:56.509> intestinal

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
is actually stimulates intestinal

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.109 
is actually stimulates intestinal
motility<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:58.110> digested<00:01:58.829> kind<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.040> wakes<00:01:59.880> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
motility or digested kind of wakes up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.410 
motility or digested kind of wakes up
your<00:02:00.270> digestive<00:02:00.630> system<00:02:01.100> -<00:02:02.240> first<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.360> all

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
your digestive system - first of all

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
your digestive system - first of all
prime<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.229> hydrochloric<00:02:04.799> acid<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
prime more hydrochloric acid in the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.770 
prime more hydrochloric acid in the
stomach<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.759> stomach<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.329> produces

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
stomach so the stomach actually produces

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
stomach so the stomach actually produces
more<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> acid<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.190> normally<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
more of the acid that it normally is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
more of the acid that it normally is
supposed<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> secrete<00:02:09.539> when<00:02:09.720> digesting<00:02:10.619> food

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
supposed to secrete when digesting food

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.809 
supposed to secrete when digesting food
so<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.400> good<00:02:11.580> thing<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
