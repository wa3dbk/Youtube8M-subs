00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.030
 1049 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 It was an explosion in the middle 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.549
 -Of love 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.549
 I found it as a base 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.679
 1 equal ratio is large 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.050
 Speaking of Malay I think a little surprisingly 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.029
 May be 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759
 Angola's thoughts 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.599
 preference 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 Normally 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.970
 There are many elephant nose area people 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.430
 It's free 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.710
 Tomomi Ando 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.170
 Gather the futon 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 It's a race 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810
 There is a way to make it explode 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.660
 Second overall 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.620
 If you do that, it's about that time 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.530
 It is upper husband when we go 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.410
 Even at the station 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.760
 I have no choice but to watch 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.490
 No, in my case 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 It is the first time in the tournament when using an explosion 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 Egashira 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.690
 from now on 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.110
 Such a thing 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.570
 This survey result was 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 The participants were in the morning on the 10th 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 While another explosion 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 Petrol administration 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 Well I like the problem first 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 Although there is a cloth, I told that I would make it disrupt 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.830
 One step larger microcomputer 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.830
 Well 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.750
 Depending on how you listen, you may think it's okay to be so slow 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 Not but the blast of Mosul 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 Listen to your heart's notes correctly 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 Have the person gathered and done 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.619
 The song is also consolidated by Albi 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.249
 I am interested 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.859
 I'm a performer like that 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.179
 Be reversed 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.519
 Sesame skill 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.519
 Even regarding this explosion 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.579
 Sayonara loses when using 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.579
 There is a big effect now 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.379
 Well this may be a special case too 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.439
 There is 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.129
 I do not know whether the rest is a little different 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.809
 When I said that I want you to ask me something like this 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.809
 I aim for 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969
 This is Midsummer Serena 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.689
 For Korea 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.509
 Otsuka Pharmaceutical 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 That we want to emphasize this rhythm 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.289
 In reaction that Toda City was 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.069
 I was conscious of Minamata 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069
 But that effectively 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.909
 Signed soft tennis 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.169
 Third term 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.299
 inside that 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.680
 With this pack
