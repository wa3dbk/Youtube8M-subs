00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.570
 hello how about welcome to a new 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.490
 tenth chapter ever with fly today 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.080
 let's talk, go in a bit 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.300
 details about careers so that 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.400
 know and know the types that exist 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.860
 part of the materials used that 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.990
 they can be from plastic to titanium 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.419
 the most important thing to consider in the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.980
 purchase of your first reel are the three 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.670
 factors that can be mentioned 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.440
 capacity the brake and the use or non-use of 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.660
 coils the capacity of the reels 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.000
 is related to the numbering of the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.700
 line to buy if they bought the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.740
 line number 5 that legion reel that at 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.990
 be able to store that number line 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.240
 5 normally on the lines as you 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.850
 they are bigger the numbers are thicker 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.950
 although they are still 80 90 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.140
 feet that are 24 27 meters are more 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.360
 thick and thicker take up more 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.520
 space and therefore the reels to 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.770
 as the size of the major line 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.259
 they must be bigger therefore it is 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.170
 important his capacity and all the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.350
 lamas of 99.9 percent reels 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.509
 indicate what is the ideal size for 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.180
 lines that support ie say for example 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.970
 this reel in a speedster 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.220
 the channel below has a 1.5 if I go 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130
 to the website of the brand of this 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.520
 reel I see in the table 1,5 more say 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.800
 a line number 4 white howard and 100 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.870
 20 dragon banking yards 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.540
 then this reel size is 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.640
 designed for a line 4 but if that 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.740
 one does some true mathematics could 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.630
 support a line 3 staying a little 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.360
 of space and getting a little less 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.160
 of back in a line 5 therefore the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.430
 reels in that sense are versatile 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.590
 that if they have that they can avoid it 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.470
 buy so many caracas for so many 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.140
 lines you have because the other point is 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.640
 that all the reels or most 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.100
 supports the change of the coils 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.070
 coil of this part download that they see 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.800
 here and that you can get the advantage is 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.420
 if only you buy a coil the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.130
 price is much lower than bought a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 full reel and that allows me to have 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.200
 a spool and several spools for 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.790
 different types of lines sizes of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.340
 long line of lines generates 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.650
 Finally 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.660
 to tell you some little things about 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.030
 the brake before moving on to more things 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.910
 general reels all 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.590
 reels have or do not have brake and there are 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.720
 a certain range of brakes that can 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 find since I have here by 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.590
 example does not have brake normally 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.599
 cartes that have no brake has a 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.590
 structure in the coil that are fixed 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.599
 has a smooth edge that is designed from 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.209
 so that I had the reel in the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.370
 cane if it is itchy as I do not have brakes 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.980
 to generate this tension in the line 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.799
 to reach the weight or use the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.440
 palm of my hand applying pressure to 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.900
 this part of the reel and so use 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.870
 my hands as if they were brakes after 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.670
 the brakes are not so strong but - 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.099
 after all, it is true that one of us 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.260
 can regulate here and also when 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.560
 being neither is very strong follows 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.079
 maintaining the architecture or the form 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.120
 where you can occupy the palm of my 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.980
 hand most charges support 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.799
 occupy in the palm of the hand without 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.959
 However, some do not because they are 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.920
 thinner to occupy the palm of my 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.020
 hand 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.239
 so I got a burn 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.670
 later if they are fixed we have camus 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.709
 reel that has almost no faith can not be 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.660
 show sick you have but in 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.599
 reality is called clicker has some 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.470
 plastic legs there are regulated with a 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.540
 allen key here above this reel 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.310
 here uses the same principle but instead 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.319
 of having a key has the advantage 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.810
 of having a knob that makes me more 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.580
 easy to regulate the brake on the internet and 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.640
 we have reels like these that have 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.290
 a brake stronger and obviously in 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.930
 smaller character is not necessary 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.180
 have such a powerful hair but it's in 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.390
 the alternative venue in the case for 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.220
 continue with the logic of the team 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.680
 recommended that the team 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.930
 number 5 that you buy has a brake 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.780
 more or less decent good that more or 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.459
 less covers the reels and to finish 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.639
 if you have noticed the reels that 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.400
 I have here some have the edge of the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.330
 displaced spool of the spool shaft and 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.220
 others we will fall into a bit of buy-in 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.950
 but yes 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.560
 the axis of the reel is sorry in the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.730
 edge of the coil is almost glued to the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.190
 axis and they have names although the normal thing is 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.190
 that to the peit the achkar for the load that 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.220
 means that the internal diameter of 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.500
 the coil is far from the center they are 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.840
 the herbert 1000 characters and that are 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.880
 far away but not so much that there are 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.640
 reels ultra the chc trees that are 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.010
 far removed the advantage of a reel in 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.560
 the chc tree one in the tailor made 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.900
 that the coal or the diameter of the part 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.760
 internal moves away from the reel is greater the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.670
 advantage that gives us that is that 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.710
 every turn of the handle that picks up today 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.590
 more line from the physical point of view 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.080
 and in the point of view of the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.310
 maintenance of the reel line 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.770
 start 2000 hardware other charges in the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.350
 ascending order makes the line 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.300
 stored on the reel are generated 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.790
 fewer pork tails than even 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.650
 store at the finish line as small 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.289
 when you take it out of the reel, 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.869
 as everything as a spring 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.270
 good is not so big can not stretch 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:36.670
 the line 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.670
 this cell of alternatives there are and 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.530
 to summarize and finish for your cart 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.380
 of an andoni cane to start that 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:48.490
 the number 5 that has a good 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.110
 full that is the chc ardor and while 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.600
 more you can pay for a road 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.300
 necessary that you must rob a bank 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.180
 but the more you can to look for yourself 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.670
 better because it will serve you for a long time 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.890
 time I hope this video has 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.530
 liked if you liked it like to share it 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.040
 with your friend and it will be until next 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.040
 video
