00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.410
 added one of the bicycle models 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 folding expressway a flight totally 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.400
 built in very light aluminum a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.420
 folding bicycle that is in one cm and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.470
 the and a half 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.110
 for a very sporty human use you can 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.070
 see without long tail without the typical 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 carrier 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.430
 to do very agile and publicly the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.990
 change of gears of the capital so that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.870
 you're hitting with curbs 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.680
 equipped with seven pine nuts 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.680
 to walk to cook 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.160
 20 inches 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:04.320
 and well let's we can teach how to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 fold so you can see a little bit 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 the concept that has bike saddles 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.810
 folding 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.040
 in which you will see that it is very compact and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.700
 very easy 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.329
 we go 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.329
 with pedals 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.010
 we follow is the handlebar the closures are 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.870
 of a very good finish 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.870
 each one of them with his insurance 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 it doesn'' T work 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.000
 as you can see that movement of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.689
 point of support we go down to make it more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.689
 compact 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.840
 we have completely stuck 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.070
 included with the bicycle who does not know 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.740
 equip this bag 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.500
 a bag reinforced with handles for 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.390
 place it inside and can transport it 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.970
 from one place to another 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.970
 comfortably and to avoid scratching and 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.160
 hit 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.580
 when deploying we do it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580
 same operation 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.560
 the easel 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.750
 very important especially for also 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.750
 insurance 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.050
 pear trees for so many 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.340
 so we put our height more or less 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 and ready we have
