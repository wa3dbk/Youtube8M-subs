00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 nice that he had to be there again 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.070
 me first two videos about 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.270
 wild herbs have arrived so well 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 I decided to do one more thing 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.250
 do so almost early in the morning and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.250
 That's why I've thought about you yet 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.170
 to show a few plants 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.879
 in late spring and early summer 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.059
 to grow 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 have a look here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.000
 that is very interesting is that here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.770
 the girls sweetie not really too 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.590
 easily confused to recognize this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.960
 red solid trunk and then this 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 tightly scrolling from what at the end of three pieces 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.940
 go out and the taste is really 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.660
 very special as I think 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.390
 may be a bit reminiscent 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.160
 bitter almond but also reminds me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.869
 a candy I ate as a kid 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.610
 but I have come not it the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.289
 taste association is there but me 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 do not know exactly what that one 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.570
 candy may have been 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.310
 someone help me there 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 In any case very interesting from 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 taste and is it some acid 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.100
 They also contain aspirin 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.459
 here is a plant 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.950
 naturally in natural form 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:35.940
 thus, sweetie is one of the few 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 natural painkiller because very good 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.429
 So for a headache or migraine 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.429
 or pain in general 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.429
 meadowsweet 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.820
 Here you see the women's coat 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.510
 maybe recognize this 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.390
 star-shaped jagged leaf in the morning 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.670
 the tower gathers in the middle and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.840
 As the name suggests, you can here 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.450
 very good against a lot of women 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.800
 Insert diseases 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.290
 against menstrual problems for 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.820
 example and he should also be very good at 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.700
 to be born because of the birth 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.080
 Birth alone is also a very good thing 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.220
 interesting plant of the women's coat 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.170
 here we have a big leaf from 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.090
 coltsfoot you may remember 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.350
 to one of my previous ones 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.840
 videos because I have the high quality 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.520
 shown and the bloom as one of 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.030
 few plants that first tried 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.950
 shows and then comes the sheet later 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:39.120
 also the leaf very decisively very much 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.120
 healthy the coltsfoot 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.989
 look here know the determined also 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.430
 quite a lot of you that's that 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:55.340
 forget-me-not blue five 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.469
 petals bloom and is in the middle 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.730
 partially white partly yellow that is 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:08.349
 so very different very good 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.030
 suitable for enhancing the look of food 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.250
 otherwise works reassuringly well against 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.319
 nervousness 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.549
 You will not forget that here 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.120
 the taste will be determined by some 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:27.650
 you know sourly mild as I think 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:33.079
 the waldmeister also a very pleasant 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.960
 Plant has a calming effect and is soothing 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.770
 good for a headache 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.340
 however you should not do too much 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.730
 eat from it because the drug coumarin 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.319
 is included in it and that can if 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.340
 you eat it in too high a can 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.340
 headaches even trigger migraine 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.970
 take a look at the beauty of nature 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.020
 on 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.690
 we have it with a year old 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.120
 to do devil's claw 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.830
 easy to recognize in these strange ones 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:12.060
 impressive flowers and the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:16.769
 heart-shaped leaves the whole plant 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:21.840
 besides it was the young flowers 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.070
 tastes very good in the salad and the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.870
 healing effect of the plant 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.870
 anti-inflammatory and analgesic 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.140
 here is also interesting 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.840
 we are allowed to also from the larger trees 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:44.460
 pay attention that young spruce needles 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.860
 taste very pleasantly acidic fit 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.440
 So also good for salad salad trousers zb 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:56.240
 or a smoothie very rich 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:59.310
 vitamin c in the name of the spruce 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.010
 Here is a copy of the gold 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.410
 fair gold fair belongs to the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:09.720
 Deadnettle resembles a bit the 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.169
 However, nettles do not sting and can 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.229
 both the flowers and the leaves 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.450
 Consume this white discoloration coming 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.810
 because the upper leaf skin 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.590
 from the lower leaf thereby solves one 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.890
 air layer is created and this the light 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.740
 reflected in gynecology 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.460
 one the gold wetness respectively 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.390
 For example, use deadnettle 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.390
 alleviate menstrual cramps 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.460
 Here you can see the creeping gÃ¼nsel too 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.310
 easier to recognize because of the candles 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.750
 grows up and then these blue ones 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.979
 owning flowers is therefore also a 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:06:00.759
 umbellifolia tastes a bit more 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:03.930
 chicory is also very suitable 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:08.310
 for example, to season soups 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.650
 he gets very reassuring 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.330
 anti-inflammatory and antibacterial 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.050
 Applied externally is also good against 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.320
 his ulcers 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.789
 here you see red clover so will the flowers 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.449
 as well as the leaves are edible 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:27.039
 the leaves are very rich in protein and 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.770
 contain isoflavones in particular 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.389
 at the menopause over women very much 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.060
 are well suited to a is rogan 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:38.409
 to prevent lack 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.819
 In addition, glasses have a purifying effect on the blood 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.050
 if the red clover is called that 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.839
 of course not the white clover 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.569
 The white clover does not remain unmentioned 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:50.019
 similar features as the red clover 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:51.429
 but he has a white flower and something 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:53.080
 you've ever been interested in me 

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:54.879
 a four-leaf clover found 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.529
 or even a five-headed one 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.379
 just write me in the 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.849
 Comments 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.379

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.479
 lanzen in spring on reproaches has you 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.919
 I like him in the summer 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.080
 go back to search

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:17.079
