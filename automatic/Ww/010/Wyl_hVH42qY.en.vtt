00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590 
would go for overheat or Fire Blast and
miss<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> shouldn't<00:01:32.759> even<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.420> heat

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

miss<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:35.700> thinking<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
miss so I'm thinking if we can get a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.170 
miss so I'm thinking if we can get a
fire<00:01:36.479> blast<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.250> miss<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.790> awesome<00:01:39.119> but

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
