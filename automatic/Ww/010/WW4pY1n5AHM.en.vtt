00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.870
 a photo 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.460
 best advertisement for transistor previous 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.640
 game from the same developers 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.800
 released by them in 2011 bastion by many 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.870
 was recognized as the best debut best indie 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.970
 projects and almost the best rp action 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.070
 years we are not sure that the transistor 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.960
 will receive the same prizes this year but 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.600
 itâ€™s no less something 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.180
 strong play like bastion transistor 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.100
 This is an isometric action rpg with a nice 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
 stylish graphics chic music and 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.910
 voiceover accompanying 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.800
 you have the whole game but instead of several 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.270
 here we have some unusual fantasy 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.370
 unusual cyberpunk 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.960
 everything seems to be familiar there is a big 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.760
 futuristic city cloud bank 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.739
 penetrated by information networks 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.629
 instructions and prohibitions where what and to whom 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.059
 possible and where you can not eat evil corporations 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.980
 and secret organizations trying for 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.629
 follow all and control everything 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.310
 finally some computer virus under 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.920
 name process which is gradually 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.560
 destroys the city it just dissolves in 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.480
 building space and whole neighborhoods but 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 the hero of the game is not a member of any 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.800
 bullets are not pumped cyborg implants 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 or former police go against 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.690
 corporations heroes fragile girl singer 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.580
 named ed and speaking sword more 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.830
 similar to a motherboard with a grip 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.570
 this sword gave the name to the whole game and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.070
 performs the role of the narrator true 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.270
 it does not communicate with the player as 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 was august he was with a girl 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.909
 these two personify classic 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 cyber banking standoff between 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.929
 something soulless mechanical 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.969
 impersonal and somehow alive warm 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.950
 she was really sensual 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.119
 popular singer who performed beautiful 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.490
 emotional songs 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.170
 and he is a young man who loved ed. 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.789
 rescued her when he attempted to attack the club 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.560
 sacrificed himself taking the path and 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.630
 released into the girl ball as a result 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 the girl lost her voice and the sword absorbed 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.590
 yourself to the soul of a young man now 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.929
 enclosed by a futuristic shell of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.390
 metal plastics and microcircuits soul 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.829
 the guy is talking to the red game without 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.450
 every preface begins squadron 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.799
 when our heroine pulls out 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.959
 transistor from the body of an unknown man 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.849
 and the sword immediately begins to communicate with her 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.530
 tired in a melancholic voice it is not 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.209
 just intrigues it at once as if 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.739
 nails you to the chair and does not give 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.510
 break away from what's going on up to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.400
 the final credits of the authors tell 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.349
 tangled but consistently 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.239
 fascinating sad and beautiful 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.220
 story which is in search of answers 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.290
 makes you listen carefully to monologues 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.910
 discover and study character biographies 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.440
 read news and posts in 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.450
 scattered everywhere information 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.430
 terminals whereby fish can leave 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.579
 comments to messages are important too 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.650
 to understand what is happening 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.049
 2 besides the story is the charm of the transistor 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.790
 of course the battle they are no less unusual 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.650
 than our heroes only at first glance 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.450
 everything is like a bastion we juggle 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.519
 active skills and with the help of all that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.650
 same sword fight with all sorts of robots 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.750
 cyber monsters and other minions 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.730
 virus attacked the city but in fact 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.290
 Deal here is a lot more tactics we are in 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.389
 any time we can put the game on 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.099
 pause and go to planning mode 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.569
 just like frozen synapse 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.609
 determine what red will do 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.919
 during the allotted time and then 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.720
 return in real time and watch 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.609
 what came of the enemies 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.560
 getting bigger they get stronger and 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.700
 stronger and often only literate 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.670
 pause planning 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.620
 helps us survive 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.569
 unusual skill system itself 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.610
 periodically we find corpses of people and 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.780
 the transistor also absorbs their souls 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.760
 converting programs 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.140
 It is these programs that become ours. 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.840
 new combat skills 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.400
 set is standard powerful blow released 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.790
 charge striking all enemies on one 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.080
 the lines 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.819
 opportunity to call for help 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.260
 ally or for example temporarily 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.720
 lure the enemy to your side 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.400
 it is unusual that each program can 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.100
 use not only as active 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.050
 skill but also as passive improving or 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.420
 giving new properties to other skills 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.069
 for example, you can increase the damage or do 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.019
 so that the same charge ricochets off 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.790
 enemies in combat allowed to use 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.190
 only four active skills available 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.989
 much more so others can 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.790
 use just like improvement but 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.310
 here which ones will be active and which ones 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.319
 passive this decides every player so 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.890
 each one has different styles and 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.350
 tactics 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.269
 there are still lightening modifiers or 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.070
 on the contrary complicating the battle this 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.620
 allows you to fine-tune the complexity of the battles 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.630
 by itself, the usual pumping is also not on 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.400
 new mouths open new slots 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.410
 and room for improvement and new 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.880
 modifiers if in battle she loses 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.800
 health is one of her skills 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.560
 overheats and becomes unavailable 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.510
 if all my gay overheat over time 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.400
 I'm recovering but until then 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.380
 have to or dispense the rest 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.390
 or fill in special terminals 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.340
 empty slots by other available tricks 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.720
 that is, you always use different 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.720
 skills and their combinations 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.270
 of course in terms of classic lpg 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.830
 the transistor is not the perfect game because deciding 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.180
 fully concentrate 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.010
 it is on a strong script 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.470
 but novi tivi authors deprived us of everything 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.850
 the rest is no side quests 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.130
 not familiar dialogues and 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.960
 interested in researching levels in 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.910
 basically we just go ahead following 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.710
 sword instructions and periodically read 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.720
 messages on information terminals 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.320
 theoretically you can move away from the plot 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.000
 the path 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.340
 good location sometimes come across 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.410
 quite spacious but most often there 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.600
 nothing but beautiful scenery to 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.000
 new enemies but everything is bathed in style 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.950
 music and atmosphere moving away somewhere 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.540
 towards the fish will not find there character with 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.170
 quest for the bosom or chest with 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.970
 treasure 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.700
 but can she come to any 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.680
 pool or to the edge of the roof stop and 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.600
 look away at the sad comments 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.860
 in love with her boyfriend living in 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.260
 futuristic device 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.760
 and there are some kind of shelters that 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.770
 again called to emphasize in 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.260
 confronting the living present and 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.330
 cold mechanical in these shelters 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.370
 before can run on the sand kick 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.500
 ball to play funny dog or 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.180
 lie down in a hammock just looking at the sky and 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.440
 listening to melancholic memories 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.440
 the person who died for her 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.460
 in general, despite the coarse 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.620
 electrician ska and name transistor 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.050
 it is very emotional and sensual and 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.360
 Plaintiff Kaya game with colorful characters 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.550
 unusual battle system enchanting 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.470
 music and intriguing storyline which 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.120
 somewhat unusual but very accurate 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.780
 conveys the philosophy of the romantic 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.780
 cyberpunk 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:31.599
 the verdict of 9 points we must take our choice
