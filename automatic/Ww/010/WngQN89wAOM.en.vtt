leave<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.509> threader<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> save

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
leave this threader on here so to save

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.300 
leave this threader on here so to save
it<00:02:02.719> I'm<00:02:03.719> actually<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.469> tie<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.770> around

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it I'm actually going to tie this around

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
it I'm actually going to tie this around
here<00:02:07.610> loop<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> around<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.110> around

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
here loop it around and then go around

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.900 
here loop it around and then go around
again<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.039> kind<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> leave<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> little

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
again and then kind of leave a little

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.540 
again and then kind of leave a little
bit<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.239> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.300 

loop<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.560> pull<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.040> out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
loop here so you can just pull this out

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220 
loop here so you can just pull this out
and<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:18.150> ready<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> next<00:02:18.780> time<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.140> don't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and it's ready the next time you don't

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.570 
and it's ready the next time you don't
have<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.500> thread<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.250> you're<00:02:20.370> switching

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
have to thread it on if you're switching

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.330 
have to thread it on if you're switching
your<00:02:20.849> colors<00:02:21.209> out<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> set<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.620> aside<00:02:22.770> I'm

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
just setting that on top of my yarn over

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.430 
just setting that on top of my yarn over
here<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.489> I've<00:02:26.610> got<00:02:26.849> my<00:02:26.880> new<00:02:27.690> color<00:02:28.020> and

and then again and I've got a little bit
of<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.330> tail<00:02:36.569> going<00:02:36.989> on<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.530> that's<00:02:37.770> going<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
going to take this Slipknot and I'm

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.449 
going to take this Slipknot and I'm
actually<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.560> put<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.769> in<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> peg<00:02:44.250> in

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
actually going to put it in the peg in

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.059 
actually going to put it in the peg in
front<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.849> my<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.959> next<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.350> my<00:02:46.500> slip<00:02:46.800> stitch

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
front of my right next to my slip stitch

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.449 
front of my right next to my slip stitch
and<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:48.050> this<00:02:49.050> loom<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> flat-panel<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and this this loom is a flat-panel and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.460 
and this this loom is a flat-panel and
this<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> beginning<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.360> my<00:02:51.420> panel<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
this is the beginning of my panel and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.490 
this is the beginning of my panel and
then<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> end<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.910> goes<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.269> big<00:02:54.450> s<00:02:54.660> so

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
then this is the end it goes in big s so

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.020 
then this is the end it goes in big s so
I'm<00:02:55.709> actually<00:02:55.830> going<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.580> second

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
I'm actually going to go on the second

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.090 
I'm actually going to go on the second
one<00:02:57.200> because<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.350> way<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.620> wraps<00:02:58.920> around

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
one because the way this wraps around

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.000 
one because the way this wraps around
this<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.549> always<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.850> slip<00:03:00.209> stitch<00:03:00.330> here<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.049> so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
this is always a slip stitch here and so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.250 
this is always a slip stitch here and so
I'm<00:03:02.130> going<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.280> put<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.489> slip<00:03:02.760> knot<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.480> front

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
I'm going to put the slip knot in front

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.509 
I'm going to put the slip knot in front
of<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.769> tighten<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.459> up<00:03:08.720> okay<00:03:09.720> now<00:03:10.519> that

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
of it and tighten that up okay now that

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.890 
of it and tighten that up okay now that
I've<00:03:11.640> got<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.819> on<00:03:12.030> there<00:03:12.239> I'm<00:03:12.750> actually

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
I've got that on there I'm actually

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.990 
I've got that on there I'm actually
going<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> take<00:03:13.410> these<00:03:13.620> two<00:03:13.680> together<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.549> this

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
going to take these two together so this

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.590 
going to take these two together so this
is<00:03:15.180> my<00:03:15.360> cut<00:03:15.750> part<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.140> my<00:03:16.319> first<00:03:17.000> strand<00:03:18.000> my

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
is my cut part of my first strand my

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.440 
is my cut part of my first strand my
first<00:03:19.140> yarn<00:03:19.650> my<00:03:20.160> gray<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.940> then<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.299> that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
first yarn my gray and then I have that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.420 
first yarn my gray and then I have that
black<00:03:21.810> boucle<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.799> now<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.950> boucle<00:03:23.310> is

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
black boucle and now the boucle is

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.979 
black boucle and now the boucle is
variegated<00:03:23.940> but<00:03:24.239> right<00:03:24.390> here<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:24.690> black<00:03:24.959> so

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
variegated but right here it's black so

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.580 
variegated but right here it's black so
I'm<00:03:25.920> going<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.160> take<00:03:26.310> them<00:03:26.810> together<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.440> I'm

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
I'm going to take them together and I'm

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.930 
I'm going to take them together and I'm
going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.769> wrap<00:03:28.950> first<00:03:29.549> I'm<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.850> wrap

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
going to wrap first I'm going to wrap

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.960 
now the pattern I have on here I'm I'm
actually<00:03:59.560> skipping<00:04:00.220> one<00:04:00.430> that's<00:04:00.730> just<00:04:00.790> a

actually skipping one that's just a
pattern<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.390> had<00:04:01.599> set<00:04:01.870> forth<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:03.129> now<00:04:03.310> that

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
pattern I had set forth but now that

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.920 
pattern I had set forth but now that
I've<00:04:03.579> already<00:04:03.819> got<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> couple<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.599> them<00:04:04.689> on

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
I've already got a couple of them on

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.949 
I've already got a couple of them on
there<00:04:05.230> I'm<00:04:06.189> just<00:04:06.519> going<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.670> take<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.360> yarn

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
there I'm just going to take this yarn

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.160 
there I'm just going to take this yarn
and<00:04:08.470> weave<00:04:09.159> it<00:04:09.340> through<00:04:12.030> okay<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:13.720> that's<00:04:13.930> my

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
and weave it through okay so that's my

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.659 
and weave it through okay so that's my
first<00:04:14.200> strand<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.040> then<00:04:15.600> my<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.949> tail<00:04:18.250> end<00:04:18.519> of

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
first strand and then my the tail end of

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.210 
first strand and then my the tail end of
my<00:04:18.729> second<00:04:19.359> strand<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.900> there<00:04:20.169> too<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:21.130> I'm

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
my second strand is there too so I'm

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.350 
my second strand is there too so I'm
actually<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:21.549> going<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:21.880> weave<00:04:22.150> that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
actually just going to weave that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.999 
actually just going to weave that
through<00:04:22.660> as<00:04:22.780> well<00:04:22.960> kind<00:04:23.259> of<00:04:23.380> in<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.590> opposite

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
through as well kind of in the opposite

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.189 
through as well kind of in the opposite
direction<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:25.210> when<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.389> knit<00:04:25.690> over<00:04:25.720> this

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
direction and so when I knit over this

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.920 
direction and so when I knit over this
actually<00:04:26.680> will<00:04:26.860> get<00:04:27.070> knit<00:04:27.789> into<00:04:28.000> my<00:04:28.330> work<00:04:28.630> and

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
actually will get knit into my work and

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.830 
actually will get knit into my work and
then<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.650> won't<00:04:29.800> see<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.479> leave<00:04:31.660> this

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
then you won't see it you can leave this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.950 
then you won't see it you can leave this
part<00:04:32.169> out<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:33.970> intend<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.600> cut<00:04:34.780> this

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
part out and I intend to cut this

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.390 
part out and I intend to cut this
because<00:04:35.199> it<00:04:35.350> gets<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.560> little<00:04:35.680> hairy<00:04:35.949> on<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
because it gets a little hairy on the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.180 
because it gets a little hairy on the
homespun<00:04:36.870> once<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.020> other<00:04:38.169> extra<00:04:38.380> yarn<00:04:38.919> kind

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
homespun once that other extra yarn kind

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.129 
homespun once that other extra yarn kind
of<00:04:39.280> goes<00:04:39.490> away<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:41.669> so<00:04:42.669> once<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.449> get<00:04:43.870> a

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
of goes away that so once you get a

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.290 
of goes away that so once you get a
couple<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.740> rows<00:04:44.949> done<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.580> starts<00:04:45.820> coming<00:04:46.150> out

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
couple of rows done it starts coming out

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.570 
couple of rows done it starts coming out
of<00:04:46.510> your<00:04:46.660> work<00:04:46.900> then<00:04:47.590> you'll<00:04:47.919> be<00:04:48.070> able<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.400> see

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
of your work then you'll be able to see

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.980 
of your work then you'll be able to see
where<00:04:48.729> these<00:04:48.849> spots<00:04:49.150> are<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.599> can<00:04:49.780> cut

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
where these spots are and you can cut

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.360 
where these spots are and you can cut
them<00:04:50.020> because<00:04:50.349> you<00:04:50.500> know<00:04:50.650> you've<00:04:50.919> already<00:04:51.099> got

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
them because you know you've already got

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.270 
them because you know you've already got
them<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.750> once<00:04:53.080> you've<00:04:53.229> wrapped<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.710> few<00:04:53.949> if<00:04:54.160> you

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
them so once you've wrapped a few if you

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.820 
them so once you've wrapped a few if you
want<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.580> go<00:04:54.699> ahead<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:55.139> knit<00:04:56.139> over<00:04:56.169> just<00:04:56.740> to

want to go ahead and knit over just to

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.710 
want to go ahead and knit over just to
make<00:04:57.009> sure<00:04:57.039> that<00:04:57.430> you've<00:04:57.580> got<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.509> could
