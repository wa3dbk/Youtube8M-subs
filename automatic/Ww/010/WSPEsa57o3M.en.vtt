 screws with a cross screwdriver 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720

 and I consider them in future videos 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.010
 because we remove all screws 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.330
 preference with a flat screwdriver 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.340
 boy 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.230
 start removing the piece that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.650
 found at the bottom of the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.650
 Case 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.790
 then we removed the back shell with 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.250
 the small plane screwdriver is 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.649
 fastened to the front by 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.560
 small lashes fastening along 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.869
 of the smartphone very carefully 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.690
 separating these tabs until separate 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.820
 completely the back shell does not 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.890
 be afraid to break nothing they are just 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.890
 small plastic eyelashes 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.800
 once we remove the back cover 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.160
 we can see the internal components of 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.440
 samsung galaxy s 4 on top 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.580
 we see the essential component of 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.890
 smartphone or as commonly known 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.830
 logic we can remove one by one the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.980
 Some components are fixed by 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.860
 clamping pins is only a matter of 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.200
 pull the others carefully just 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.900
 using a small screw or glued to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.910
 the housing the front of the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.150
 smartphone is composed of several 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.430
 pieces glued to the front casing in 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.930
 the middle part is the screen and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.930
 in front of the touch screen 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.910
 to change the screen you have to separate 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.510
 all the back pieces up 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.510
 release it 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.530
 to change the touch screen you have to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.530
 remove it using a heat gun 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.880
 if they are going to change both I recommend them 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.390
 acquire the complete piece that consists of 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.560
 the front case the screen and the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.560
 touch screen I hope you have served them 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 regards
