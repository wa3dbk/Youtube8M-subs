00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.610
 so hello to everyone that flew and mine 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.910
 another video on how to do 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 plastic suspended ceilings in the bathroom 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.070
 room or in other rooms where there is 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.380
 moisture do this kind of cooking 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.930
 so that they are moisture resistant before 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 here is the ceiling you did 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.630
 own hands with embedded 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.030
 lamps will be very beautiful to us very 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.430
 convenient and how to do it 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 tell in this video for this to us 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.350
 will need 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.170
 beam 30 by 40 plastic width 250 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.350
 70 mm and 40 mm self tapping screws 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.289
 with two dozen luminaire quantities 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:05.539
 four pieces and wire and most importantly 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:05.539
 wish you like walls also 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.619
 bully 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.320
 Of course I tried cutting the timber lengthwise 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.940
 our room 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.110
 we strengthen it around the perimeter of our room 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.410
 departing with the place on our 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.410
 light fixtures 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.110
 we strengthen timber 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.069
 tapping holes mark on 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.069
 tile surface 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.510
 then a strong hole in the tile and so 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.510
 around the perimeter 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.720
 do not forget zabrus installed inside 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.459
 perimeter, it serves not only fasteners 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.459
 plastic but all wiring 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.400
 plastic along or across the door to solve 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.400
 it all depends on the rest of the material 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.069
 the first sheet is cut to the full width of the bathroom 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.470
 behind them we do not forget to shoot another 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.959
 plastic stepan timber through one need 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.659
 add as plastic fragile 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.659
 material and at any time he can 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.659
 to sag 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.900
 we cut a hole for with people 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.880
 special room 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.570
 The appointment of such a drill was already mentioned in 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.570
 previous video 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.530
 subsequent lamp, wire 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.790
 and to the source 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 the rest of the lamps are connected correctly 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:05:00.750
 I bring the scheme here in this case the main thing 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.910
 nothing mess there were cases 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.760
 r as attack pushes write sabotage 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.320
 about the same is not the same as Come-let Ugi Ugi 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.320
 different about the same do not understand 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.360
 we bring plastic stripes to the end 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.110
 forget to correctly mark and cut 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.110
 last page 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.000
 some 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.100
 and our ceiling overlaps on 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.850
 masters such skirting ceiling 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.680
 he is of different width separate tips 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.200
 like u will not give the glue as here 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.690
 need a special fat one want to add 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.690
 that you have to wash your hands before sticking 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:01.489
 well now let's see it 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.449
 video to the end and see what we have 

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:04.449
 happened 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.860
 done this work I want to open 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.690
 but I am satisfied with the same tile concelebrated 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.240
 waterproofing function for shower 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.620
 and of course our super ceiling he 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.620
 highlights the beauty of the veil 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.120
 what about cut corner tiles is 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.210
 customer requirements leave a whole 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.920
 piece on the side of the shower in such 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.460
 situations I recommend to balance 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.040
 sides do not make small undercuts 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.770
 but in our situation it is a necessity well 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.840
 in the meantime , wait for other videos put 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.840
