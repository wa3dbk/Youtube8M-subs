00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:21.349
 and I would have gone up to 14.5 okay 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.460
 concretely it made things 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.939
 downtown you have the means 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.770
 usual 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.960
 if you come out ok Wednesday 29 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.899
 January 2014 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 addax the adour reaches 5 meter 76 the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.350
 level that had not been raised since 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 over 30 years 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 if the populations are not directly 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 danger several points are problematic 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.860
 and may cripple the city for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.970
 manage the emergency departmental service 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 of fire and relief of the moors the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.470
 say has set up a post of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.020
 advanced command at dax he's busy 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.590
 a vast area stretching from tartas to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.690
 tarnos 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.460
 yes on a vision always his lover 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.660
 and who is who and who is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.220
 very low missed day 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.780
 of today but 4 is high 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.549
 the problem is all the years 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.399
 since that have been falling since 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.200
 yesterday but no longer evacuates and 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.299
 accumulate on the low poems and we have 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.350
 really strategic sectors on 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.030
 dax including the train station since 3am this morning 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.229
 the hotels and then the neighborhood of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
 the outskirts of the hospital 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.580
 we really have three sectors a little 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.800
 delicate on which 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.990
 we do big pumping and we 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.440
 makes the street all that water on the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.120
 request in the night around 1:30 strong 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.780
 Precipitation has made the situation 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.430
 critical to deal with the urgency the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.100
 120 military civil security 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.530
 already positioned in the southwest have 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.600
 been directed to dax they deployed 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.910
 their important means of pumping into 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.610
 the city â€‹â€‹center to empty the sub 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.360
 soils of neighboring hotels adour more 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.160
 at the rising waters 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.720
 an electrical transformer had to be 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.990
 disconnected depriving a neighborhood 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.190
 electricity for several hours 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 but the most difficult point to handle 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.780
 this day is the dax station got to 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.179
 a few centimeters of the voices the water has 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.619
 limited the movement of trains while 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.900
 that the undergrounds reserved for the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.959
 passenger traffic was invaded 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.820
 of water from the first step in the steps 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.820
 to make sure of hell and rhythmic 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.360
 the ages a version denied 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.920
 most infiltrations 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.580
 since our awakening that is to say little 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:51.520
 close two hours 1h30 2h hour and a half 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.530
 5 75 5 78 50 cm we have not finished 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.440
 We'll see 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.800
 I made a reconnaissance 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.800
 aubagnac for the animal in difficulty 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.900
 a consultation meeting for 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.300
 how to prosecute because a lot of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.910
 means is what we can complete them in 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.010
 remove and put others in place 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.760
 place every hour available at 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.870
 proof the sncf on the circulation 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.880
 the city on evacuation problems 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.240
 stormwater everything and everything is 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.790
 connected 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.470
 every decision impact impact on the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.260
 others during this meeting 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.420
 the situation gets complicated at the station a 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 pipeline has just given way 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.860
 more pumping means immediately 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.020
 asked the civil security I them 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.530
 sends 150 cubic meters like that it 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.840
 professed on guard what does it put in 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.380
 jeopardize all rail traffic 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.060
 france spain 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.890
 everything is blocked everything goes through dax 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.510
 easy to park our analysis is good 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.580
 it's very problematic for sncf 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.480
 so we have to integrate because all these 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.519
 transportation issues the center 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.950
 operational the codis based at 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.320
 mont-de-marsan continues to centralize 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.950
 all calls received at 18 and deployed 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.620
 means 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.150
 the dax crisis command post 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.830
 is responsible for managing the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.320
 flood situations 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.180
 the contact is permanent with the elected ones 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.280
 to know the situations that 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.810
 could prove complicated that it 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.850
 also means whether or not I know they 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.460
 do not pay their straw our three threats 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.340
 have threatened but there is no old velma 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.690
 major problem there are certainly heavy 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.550
 it started well but nothing in 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.590
 particular for the moment the people 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.470
 isolated are identified is regularly 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.390
 called mister ben yes hello this is the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.760
 house that was isolated you know we 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.470
 saw yesterday they would be frozen water 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.300
 will start going in I'll go to you 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.180
 send a team of lifeguards to 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.289
 surface with a boat 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.080
 but they must take out a cross of 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.699
 ballet mission ensures saubusse with 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.360
 an isolated person the second 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.759
 demonstration 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.389
 did you come to a risk of strong 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:04.699
 currents all day the teams 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.770
 specialized in aquatic rescue go 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.250
 intervene 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.250
 I named 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.529
 left no 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.529
 cinema side 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.660
 Yes 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:38.100
 dead worried you secure Mrs. 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.100
 okay there will be everything tried 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.190
 total in the day about 250 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.539
 firefighters were mobilized all over the 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.419
 department to deal with 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.840
 floods at 7 pm at the time of the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.539
 reports 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.039
 the situation at the station is under control but 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.810
 remains under close surveillance 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.610
 they are led to have water offal 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.590
 very consistent which are a priori 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.669
 announced for tomorrow night but he 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.320
 Perhaps we should strengthen the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.180
 pumping means for paris is going 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.880
 compensate for these high-level arrivals from 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.229
 the day station was intense 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.419
 today especially started very early 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.800
 we spent the day moving 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.750
 motor pumps from one site to another and 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.490
 call mostly reinforcements since 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.150
 arriving at the hands we were at saturation 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.590
 of our means 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.169
 so we brought in ways of everything 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.729
 the department and one even expressed in 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.560
 mid -afternoon in liaison and the 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.480
 prefecture a request 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.340
 national average of pumping that are going 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.750
 happen here in the night on 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.250
 dax since saturday 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.139
 concretely but we just move 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.810
 means started by a 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.330
 problematic on ap roide ranges 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.200
 Saturday sundays and Mondays it was 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.639
 deported for a problem on 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.690
 the adour to the east of the department 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.950
 r grenade teaches cv etc yesterday it was 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.900
 on house spikes today on dax 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.130
 will have only moved all these 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.960
 means there on the areas that are 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.700
 impacted and maybe at the end of the week 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.370
 on the coast to the weather forecast 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.830
 for the weekend a bit peculiar 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.930
 with a fairly serious weather and especially 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.400
 a very strong swell announced for the 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.340
 weekend had very coefficients 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.229
 important that goes up to 115 samu which 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.910
 the current risk as we call it 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.680
 do not stop you have to keep 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.510
 mobilized staff for 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.490
 satisfy the current risks it 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.479
 relief to people and the insanities that 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.040
 you saw that they can occur 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.040
 even in very wet periods 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.190
 in 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.190
 in 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.949
 in 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.949
 in
