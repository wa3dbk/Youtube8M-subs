Hey YouTube friends!

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.710
So you guys seem to really like my Freezer
Breakfast Burritos episode from the Kickstart

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.340
Series and that recipe also happens to be
one of twenty-five in the free recipe book

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.740
portion of my newest eBook 'Meal Prep: A Beginner's
Guide'.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.070
I will put a link below if you're interested
but it's pretty much everything you need to

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.380
know about meal prep.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.869
So I thought today I would do another recipe
from that book of a similar fashion - My Freezer

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.059
Breakfast Sandwiches.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.899
It is perfect for those on-the-go mornings
which, let's be real is always.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.079
Thumbs up if you're soaked about this recipe.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.260
First we will make our egg patties for the
sandwiches.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.469
Start by spraying down six ramekins on your
baking sheet.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.100
I used seven to eight ounces but just make
sure they are oven safe.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.980
And you can either use egg, egg-whites or
a combination of both.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.829
Here I have started with an egg and then just
added a little bit of extra egg-white to get

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.320
about one quarter to a third cup of egg mixture
in each ramekin total.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.220
So if you decide to use egg-whites make sure
that you get about that amount.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.040
Also a side note: I have noticed in the past
when I make these with egg-whites or egg substitute

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.710
that these sandwiches tend to defrost a little
bit better.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.010
So remember these are freezer breakfast sandwiches
so you have to defrost them and cook them

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.110
in the microwave in the morning and when I
use the full egg sometimes the rest of the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.530
sandwich cooks and the full egg stays - frozen.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.020
And you have to cook it separately so if you
want this to be easier I would recommend going

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.600
with the egg substitute or egg-whites.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.980
Since I am using some real eggs here and I
want them to be like a scrambled patty I'm

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.700
just going to whisk those up.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.090
Transfer the entire baking sheet into an oven
pre-heated to 375o Fahrenheit for about 15

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.200
to 20 minutes.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.460
It's going to depend on whether you're using
eggs or egg-whites or a combination so just

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.460
watch them.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.180
You want to make sure theyâ€™re cooked thoroughly.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.670
Allow to cool a little bit before removing
them from the ramekin and you will find perfect

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.280
little egg patties.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.590
Now it's time to assemble a sandwich.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.629
Start with an English muffin - Ezekiel, gluten
free, whole wheat, anything you prefer will

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.629
work.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.319
And then you are going to layer on your egg
patty, some deli meat - I used lean chicken

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.129
breast here but anything will work.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.200
And a little bit of cheese - I prefer the
thinly sliced cheddar cheese but if you prefer

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.250
to go with the low fat or a Swiss or whatever
cheese you want that is just fine.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.090
Then you will just wrap it up in plastic wrap
and repeat with the rest of your sandwiches.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.620
I made six because the English muffins come
in a pack of six so it just made sense.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.590
Transfer to a large Ziploc bag or Tupperware
and then store in the freezer for later.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.920
When it is time to reheat in the morning you
just want to remove the plastic, wrap it in

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.879
a paper towel and then heat it in the microwave
for about one minute and then flip it and

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.060
do another minute.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.280
And like I said the egg-whites tend to defrost
a little bit easier.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280
And there you have it!

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.739
My delicious egg breakfast sandwiches!

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.200

or any meal really!
