00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
look at the zombie and you look at his

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.500 
look at the zombie and you look at his
head<00:00:32.369> you're<00:00:32.579> noticing<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.300> seeing

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
head you're noticing that we're seeing

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.440 
head you're noticing that we're seeing
yellowy<00:00:34.170> eyes<00:00:34.890> coming<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> glow

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
yellowy eyes coming out or the glow

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
yellowy eyes coming out or the glow
coming<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> his<00:00:37.079> eyes<00:00:37.290> instead<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
coming out of his eyes instead of the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
coming out of his eyes instead of the
red<00:00:38.730> glow<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:39.930> theories<00:00:40.110> on

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
red glow so I do have some theories on

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.930 
red glow so I do have some theories on
this<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.040> counter<00:00:41.460> theories<00:00:41.820> as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
this I do have some counter theories as

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
this I do have some counter theories as
well<00:00:42.149> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.840> explaining<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.730> thoughts

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
well kind of explaining my my thoughts

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
well kind of explaining my my thoughts
on<00:00:45.270> why<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.809> yellow<00:00:46.050> eyes<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on why we see yellow eyes on this so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220 
on why we see yellow eyes on this so
first<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.250> theory<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.510> could<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.079> like

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
first of all theory one it could be like

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
first of all theory one it could be like
what<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.039> nuketown<00:00:50.370> where<00:00:50.850> we're

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
what we see in nuketown where we're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
what we see in nuketown where we're
actually<00:00:51.149> playing<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
actually playing and the start of the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
actually playing and the start of the
map<00:00:52.949> Sam<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> control<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> zombies<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
map Sam is in control of the zombies and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
map Sam is in control of the zombies and
then<00:00:55.140> once<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> wave<00:00:55.890> 25<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:57.090> hear<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
then once we get to wave 25 we hear the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.260 
then once we get to wave 25 we hear the
audio<00:00:57.840> transmission<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> Richthofen<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> we

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
audio transmission of Richthofen and we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.580 
audio transmission of Richthofen and we
hear<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:00.960> switched<00:01:01.230> bodies<00:01:01.410> with

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
hear that he has switched bodies with

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
hear that he has switched bodies with
Sam<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.309> Richthofen<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.059> charged<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
Sam and now Richthofen is charged so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899 
Sam and now Richthofen is charged so
maybe<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> same<00:01:05.100> thing<00:01:05.129> maybe<00:01:05.549> in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
maybe this is the same thing maybe in

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
maybe this is the same thing maybe in
mob<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> dead<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.229> Alcatraz<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.280> Vril

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
mob of the dead and in Alcatraz the Vril

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
mob of the dead and in Alcatraz the Vril
so<00:01:09.000> no<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:09.869> controlling<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
so no one is actually controlling the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
so no one is actually controlling the
zombies<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> certain

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
zombies and then we get to a certain

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.770 
zombies and then we get to a certain
wave<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.610> unwind<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
wave and we see that kind of unwind and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
wave and we see that kind of unwind and
we<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.080> Sam<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.950> being<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.610> troll<00:01:17.939> of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
we see Sam actually being in troll of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
we see Sam actually being in troll of
the<00:01:18.210> zombies<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.110> control<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the zombies are in control of the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.249 
the zombies are in control of the
zombies<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:21.090> could<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.600> second

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
zombies and it could be that second

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.679 
zombies and it could be that second
theory<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:24.030> one's<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
theory I have is this one's kind of a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
theory I have is this one's kind of a
shooting<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.470> hit<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> Miss<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
shooting or a hit and a Miss with that

everything<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> tried<00:01:49.380> I'm<00:01:50.369> guessing<00:01:50.880> once<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
everything I tried I'm guessing once you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.210 
everything I tried I'm guessing once you
skip<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> can't<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.320> again<00:01:52.409> until<00:01:52.649> 24

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
skip it you can't see it again until 24

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.170 
skip it you can't see it again until 24
hours<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.549> something<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.000> not

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hours or something because it's not

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
hours or something because it's not
letting<00:01:54.390> me<00:01:54.479> view<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.799> give<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
letting me view it to actually give you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.920 
letting me view it to actually give you
that<00:01:56.130> content<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.759> third<00:01:57.060> actual<00:01:57.630> theory

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that content but my third actual theory

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.830 
that content but my third actual theory
is<00:01:58.369> after<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.460> complete<00:01:59.880> an<00:02:00.060> easter<00:02:00.479> egg<00:02:00.509> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is after you complete an easter egg so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
is after you complete an easter egg so
let's<00:02:01.049> say<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.770> complete<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.219> easter

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
let's say we actually complete an easter

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.440 
let's say we actually complete an easter
egg<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.969> samantha

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
egg and we actually see kind of samantha

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.730 
egg and we actually see kind of samantha
switch<00:02:06.659> bodies<00:02:06.869> maybe<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> wave

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
switch bodies maybe it's not a wave

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.380 
switch bodies maybe it's not a wave
thing<00:02:08.009> maybe<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.399> confirming<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.270> we've

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
thing maybe it's confirming that we've

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.729 
thing maybe it's confirming that we've
done<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> easter<00:02:09.989> egg<00:02:10.110> maybe<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
done the easter egg maybe this is the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.050 
done the easter egg maybe this is the
big<00:02:10.920> easter<00:02:11.280> egg<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> map<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.970> we

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
big easter egg in the map and we

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.940 
big easter egg in the map and we
actually<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.440> gets

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
actually have to do it to gets

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.220 
actually have to do it to gets

said<00:02:18.420> before<00:02:18.569> now<00:02:19.379> counter<00:02:19.920> theories<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.519> this

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
said before now counter theories on this

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.119 
said before now counter theories on this
there<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> few<00:02:21.660> there's<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.050> many<00:02:22.349> but

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
there is a few there's not many but

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.070 
there is a few there's not many but
first<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.000> could<00:02:24.239> just<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.540> an<00:02:24.690> editing

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
first of all it could just be an editing

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.440 
first of all it could just be an editing
mistake<00:02:25.440> even<00:02:26.129> other<00:02:26.550> people<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.420> done

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
mistake even other people have done

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.030 
mistake even other people have done
editing<00:02:27.750> mistakes<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> trailers<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.950> then

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
editing mistakes and trailers and then

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.339 
editing mistakes and trailers and then
kind<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.879> either<00:02:30.269> ignored<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.900> or<00:02:31.019> tried<00:02:31.230> to

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
kind of either ignored it or tried to

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.839 
kind of either ignored it or tried to
fix<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.950> could<00:02:32.099> just<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.310> an<00:02:32.489> editing

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
fix it so it could just be an editing

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.180 
fix it so it could just be an editing
mistake<00:02:33.180> maybe<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.930> was<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.290> before<00:02:34.440> when

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
mistake maybe this was like before when

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.500 
mistake maybe this was like before when
they<00:02:35.310> were<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.550> testing<00:02:35.730> out<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> map<00:02:36.269> maybe

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
they were just testing out the map maybe

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.089 
they were just testing out the map maybe
they<00:02:36.690> hadn't<00:02:36.989> put<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> red<00:02:37.410> eyes<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.769> yet

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
they hadn't put the red eyes in yet

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.800 
they hadn't put the red eyes in yet
maybe<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.459> was<00:02:38.580> actually<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.450> sam

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
maybe it was actually going to be sam

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.600 
maybe it was actually going to be sam
and<00:02:40.049> then<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.290> decided<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:41.190> put<00:02:41.370> something

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and then they decided to put something

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.309 
and then they decided to put something
different<00:02:42.090> kind<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.360> twist<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.110> map

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
different kind of a twist on to the map

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.160 
different kind of a twist on to the map
or<00:02:43.590> second<00:02:44.489> thing<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.420> could<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.049> be

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
or second thing it could just be
