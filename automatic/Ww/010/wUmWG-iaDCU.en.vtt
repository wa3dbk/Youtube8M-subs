only one I had left was the white with
clear<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:31.490> I<00:01:31.520> saw<00:01:31.729> this<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:31.999> I<00:01:32.329> was<00:01:32.450> like

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
clear but then I saw this and I was like

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.440 
clear but then I saw this and I was like
you<00:01:33.499> know<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.920> could<00:01:34.640> probably<00:01:34.789> get<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.240> clear

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
you know I could probably get the clear

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.179 
you know I could probably get the clear
lens<00:01:35.689> since<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.140> in<00:01:36.289> good<00:01:36.439> condition<00:01:36.499> and

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
lens since it's in good condition and

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.910 
lens since it's in good condition and
then<00:01:37.310> search<00:01:37.609> for<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.359> white<00:01:39.170> frame<00:01:39.439> later<00:01:39.649> on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
then search for a white frame later on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.880 
then search for a white frame later on
and<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.060> do<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.359> then<00:01:41.840> I'm<00:01:42.469> in<00:01:42.590> good<00:01:42.710> shape

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
and if I do that then I'm in good shape

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.469 
and if I do that then I'm in good shape
because<00:01:43.069> then<00:01:43.399> even<00:01:43.670> if<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> lens<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.210> kind<00:01:44.420> of

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
because then even if the lens is kind of

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.179 
because then even if the lens is kind of
beat-up<00:01:44.810> at<00:01:45.049> least<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.289> have<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.439> pristine<00:01:45.799> lands

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
beat-up at least I have a pristine lands

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.260 
beat-up at least I have a pristine lands
and<00:01:46.340> no<00:01:46.399> but<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:46.729> know<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:46.909> frame<00:01:47.119> usually

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and no but you know the frame usually

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.870 
and no but you know the frame usually
takes<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.749> lot<00:01:47.899> more<00:01:47.929> beating<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.159> can<00:01:49.700> kind

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
takes a lot more beating so I can kind

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.230 
takes a lot more beating so I can kind
of<00:01:49.939> combine<00:01:50.119> them<00:01:50.479> into<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.869> end<00:01:51.409> result<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.909> I

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
of combine them into the end result so I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.629 
of combine them into the end result so I
saw<00:01:53.539> this<00:01:53.749> and<00:01:54.049> how<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.679> buy<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:54.979> now<00:01:55.189> for<00:01:55.490> one

waited it out I didn't go right for the
buy<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.480> now<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:11.690> got<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.140> half<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.440> price

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
buy it now I got it for half the price

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.150 
buy it now I got it for half the price
the<00:04:13.430> Buy<00:04:13.549> It<00:04:13.610> Now<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:14.000> was<00:04:14.180> 200<00:04:15.110> which<00:04:16.040> I

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
the Buy It Now and this was 200 which I

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.849 
the Buy It Now and this was 200 which I
think<00:04:16.340> still<00:04:16.609> if<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.570> was<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:17.810> white<00:04:18.079> clear<00:04:18.680> I

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
think still if this was a white clear I

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.240 
think still if this was a white clear I
might<00:04:19.850> have<00:04:20.060> jumped<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.720> but<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.320> just

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
might have jumped on it but I just

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.890 
might have jumped on it but I just
decided<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.760> kind<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.060> wait<00:04:23.210> for<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.479> auction

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
decided to kind of wait for the auction

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.870 
decided to kind of wait for the auction
and<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.380> know<00:04:24.530> no<00:04:24.740> one<00:04:24.890> else<00:04:24.979> bid<00:04:25.220> there's

a<00:04:32.510> lot<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:32.990> things<00:04:33.170> with<00:04:33.260> high<00:04:33.380> prices

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
a lot of the things with high prices

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.560 
a lot of the things with high prices

that<00:04:40.190> if<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.370> if<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.730> see<00:04:40.880> an<00:04:40.970> oxygen<00:04:41.330> just

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
that if you if you see an oxygen just

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.960 
that if you if you see an oxygen just
spend<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.470> time<00:04:42.710> wait<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.160> out<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.940> should

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
really exciting it's been several years

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.050

since<00:06:12.920> I've<00:06:13.160> been<00:06:13.280> trying<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.640> complete<00:06:13.910> that

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
collection so hopefully that should be

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.540

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
ordering for that because I you know

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.990 
ordering for that because I you know
most<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:21.020> my<00:06:21.080> slashes<00:06:21.500> came<00:06:21.680> later<00:06:21.950> but<00:06:22.040> I'm<00:06:22.790> so

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
most of my slashes came later but I'm so

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.070 
most of my slashes came later but I'm so
excited<00:06:23.300> about<00:06:23.420> that<00:06:23.570> I<00:06:23.690> think<00:06:23.840> I'm<00:06:23.990> gonna

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
excited about that I think I'm gonna

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.140 
excited about that I think I'm gonna
actually<00:06:24.290> break<00:06:24.680> that<00:06:24.860> out<00:06:24.950> sooner<00:06:25.220> so<00:06:25.520> I<00:06:25.730> hope

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
actually break that out sooner so I hope

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.250
