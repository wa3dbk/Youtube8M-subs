00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.670
 very good girls or good guys I am 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.740
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.590
 all very well as you are seeing then 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.180
 the camera has changed a lot what 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.840
 is the quality of the image is 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.009
 much better and good that's one of 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.720
 the things that in the main channel 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.119
 you have the unboxing of the new camera 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.949
 that we have and today we are going to talk about something 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.230
 super interesting we've been talking 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.010
 many times in several videos on the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.830
 hidden face of the moon and finally a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.110
 camera located on the discover satellite 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.050
 of NASA has captured a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.570
 impressive image of the hidden side of 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.510
 dark side of the hidden side of the moon 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.390
 when it was lit by the sun how many 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.059
 Eloquence not the photographs were 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.850
 taken at 1.6 million kilometers from 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.940
 the land on July 16 and you can 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.400
 see how the moon is moving over the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.920
 Pacific ocean near america 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.269
 north the north pole of the earth is 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.220
 finding is not found in the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.560
 upper corner to the left of the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.869
 image reflecting the inclination 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.190
 orbital of our planet from the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.130
 point of view of 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.480
 the satellites we must also say that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.670
 this is not the first time you observe 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.320
 the hidden side of the moon because the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.990
 first time it was in 1950 and 59 that the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.990
 lunar space probe 3 captured the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.850
 images of this sector not visible from 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.610
 our planet since then there 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.550
 several space missions in which 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.010
 they have been able to photograph in detail 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.410
 the zone is distant, however it is 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.660
 the first time it's achieved with 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.690
 so much lighting the images of the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.670
 moon created by the probe 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.620
 Discover have combined to be able to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.080
 create a 20-second video of 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.540
 duration that is what you have to the best 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.580
 there is a shoot so nothing guys without 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.850
 more delay I leave you and you know 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.390
 comment to see what you think this up 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.390
 the next
