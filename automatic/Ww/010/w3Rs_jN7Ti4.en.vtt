00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
covers the entire cake and it seals in

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.590 
covers the entire cake and it seals in
the<00:02:12.980> crumbs<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.790> your<00:02:13.880> final<00:02:14.120> coat<00:02:14.420> looks

over<00:02:23.630> with<00:02:23.780> your<00:02:23.930> offset<00:02:24.230> spatula<00:02:24.739> but<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.220> nice

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
over with your offset spatula but a nice

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.729 
over with your offset spatula but a nice
way<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:25.970> really<00:02:26.239> smooth<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:27.530> use<00:02:27.709> a

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
way to get it really smooth just use a

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.830 
way to get it really smooth just use a
piece<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> paper<00:02:28.750> cut<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.900> paper<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.410> this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
piece of paper cut the paper like this

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.150 
piece of paper cut the paper like this
curve<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> side<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.680> cake<00:02:33.920> and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
curve it to the side of the cake and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.120 
curve it to the side of the cake and
pull<00:02:34.970> straight<00:02:35.150> up<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> get<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> nice

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
pull straight up and you get a nice

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.590 
pull straight up and you get a nice
smooth<00:02:38.030> edge<00:02:40.000> continue<00:02:41.000> around<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.269> entire

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
smooth edge continue around the entire

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:52.570 
smooth edge continue around the entire
cake<00:02:50.170> okay<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.500> sides<00:02:51.769> look<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.280> smooth

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
cake okay the sides look really smooth

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.460 
cake okay the sides look really smooth
I'm<00:02:52.940> just<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.300> take<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.780> inside<00:02:54.170> and

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
I'm just going to take the inside and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.100 
I'm just going to take the inside and
spread<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> smooth<00:02:55.700> also<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.720> doesn't<00:02:56.959> matter

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
spread it smooth also it doesn't matter

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.090 
spread it smooth also it doesn't matter
how<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:57.440> going<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.650> look<00:02:57.739> because<00:02:57.950> it's

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
how that's going to look because it's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.150 
how that's going to look because it's
going<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> get<00:02:58.459> filled<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.880> later<00:02:59.920> now<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.100> I

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.020 
it on you can actually turn a pedestal
like<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.709> make<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:48.980> easier<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.579> frost<00:03:49.850> the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
like this to make it easier to frost the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:04:01.839 
like this to make it easier to frost the
cake

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.300 

okay<00:04:02.569> it's<00:04:02.749> all<00:04:02.870> covered<00:04:03.200> now<00:04:03.829> you<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.099> few

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
okay it's all covered now you have a few

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.190 
okay it's all covered now you have a few
choices<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:05.299> can<00:04:05.420> go<00:04:05.569> ahead<00:04:05.689> and<00:04:05.959> make<00:04:06.079> it

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
choices you can go ahead and make it

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.959 
choices you can go ahead and make it
smooth<00:04:06.469> again<00:04:06.769> with<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:07.069> same<00:04:07.310> technique<00:04:07.790> we

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:07.969 
smooth again with that same technique we

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.910 
smooth again with that same technique we
did<00:04:08.090> with<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.329> crumb<00:04:08.540> coat<00:04:08.749> and<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.019> paper<00:04:09.230> or

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
did with the crumb coat and the paper or

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.949 
did with the crumb coat and the paper or
you<00:04:10.069> can<00:04:10.159> give<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> little<00:04:10.549> texture<00:04:10.939> you<00:04:11.900> can

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
you can give it a little texture you can

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.800 
you can give it a little texture you can
do<00:04:12.170> lines<00:04:12.409> up<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:12.920> down<00:04:13.129> I<00:04:13.480> think<00:04:14.480> I'm<00:04:14.719> going

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
do lines up and down I think I'm going

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.099 
do lines up and down I think I'm going
to<00:04:14.870> give<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.170> some<00:04:15.200> little<00:04:15.620> swirls<00:04:16.930> just<00:04:17.930> take

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
to give it some little swirls just take

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.920 
to give it some little swirls just take
