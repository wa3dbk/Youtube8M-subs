00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
little forward and then lock it into
that<00:02:02.159> position<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.479> when<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.869> bring

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that position so that when you bring

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.859 
that position so that when you bring
your<00:02:04.170> camera<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.430> hand

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
your camera and you can do with one hand

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.479 
your camera and you can do with one hand
you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> actually<00:02:07.140> push<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.069> slide

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
you can actually push down and slide

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.669 
you can actually push down and slide
forward<00:02:08.519> and<00:02:08.970> it'll<00:02:09.209> lock<00:02:09.420> once<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.349> locked

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
forward and it'll lock once it's locked

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.589 
forward and it'll lock once it's locked
it's<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.099> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> maneuver<00:02:11.610> anywhere<00:02:11.970> now

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it's not going to maneuver anywhere now

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.509 
it's not going to maneuver anywhere now
if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.079> want<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.799> loosen<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
if you want you can loosen this all the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.119 
if you want you can loosen this all the
way<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.510> pivots<00:02:15.810> really<00:02:16.260> nice<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.799> smooth

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
way and it pivots really nice and smooth

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.880 
way and it pivots really nice and smooth
you<00:02:17.400> got<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> little<00:02:18.420> careful<00:02:18.540> because

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you got to be a little careful because

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.650 
you got to be a little careful because
it<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.880> weight<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.270> take<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
it will you know the weight will take it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.309 
it will you know the weight will take it
but

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
but

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.130 
but
if<00:02:22.499> you<00:02:22.859> just<00:02:23.099> twist<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.670> slightly<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.749> give

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
if you just twist this slightly and give

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.099 
if you just twist this slightly and give
it<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> little<00:02:25.499> tension<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:26.700> actually<00:02:27.209> will

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
it a little tension it actually will

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.679 
it a little tension it actually will
lock<00:02:28.859> up<00:02:28.889> and<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.549> actually<00:02:29.730> turn<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.299> and

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
lock up and you can actually turn it and

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.339 
lock up and you can actually turn it and
it<00:02:30.900> won't<00:02:30.989> fall<00:02:31.549> it'll<00:02:32.549> hold<00:02:32.760> its<00:02:32.969> position<00:02:33.349> so

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
it won't fall it'll hold its position so

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.399 
it won't fall it'll hold its position so
all<00:02:34.889> you<00:02:35.189> do<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.760> apply<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.599> little<00:02:36.840> tiny

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
all you do is just apply a little tiny

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.069 
all you do is just apply a little tiny
maneuverability<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.670> wheel<00:02:39.599> there<00:02:39.810> just

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
maneuverability on the wheel there just

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.440 
maneuverability on the wheel there just
turn<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.409> just<00:02:40.530> slightly<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.239> back

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
turn it just slightly and then it's back

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.949 
turn it just slightly and then it's back
to<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.739> know<00:02:43.859> being<00:02:44.099> very<00:02:44.129> fluent<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
to you know being very fluent and the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.409 
to you know being very fluent and the
movement<00:02:46.409> um<00:02:46.549> overall<00:02:47.549> really<00:02:47.969> nice<00:02:48.209> I'm

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
movement um overall really nice I'm

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.780 
movement um overall really nice I'm
going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.599> go<00:02:48.659> ahead<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.049> not<00:02:49.290> my<00:02:49.519> SLR<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.639> this

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
going to go ahead and not my SLR to this

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.000 
going to go ahead and not my SLR to this
and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.480> guys<00:02:51.599> can<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.079> how<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:52.859> handles

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and then you guys can see how it handles

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.179 
and then you guys can see how it handles
a<00:02:53.400> little<00:02:53.939> bit<00:02:54.030> larger<00:02:54.299> camera<00:02:54.769> okay<00:02:55.769> guys<00:02:55.980> I

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
got my tripod ready I locked it into

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.050 
got my tripod ready I locked it into
position<00:02:58.590> aimed<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.370> forward<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> little<00:02:59.819> bit

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
position aimed it forward a little bit

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
so you can use the way to the camera I

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.270 
so you can use the way to the camera I
got<00:03:01.560> my<00:03:01.650> Canon<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.000> my<00:03:03.209> Canon<00:03:03.900> t4i<00:03:04.169> I<00:03:04.590> went

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
weighs quite a bit I use it for sporting

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.189 
weighs quite a bit I use it for sporting
events<00:03:16.949> or<00:03:17.280> whatever<00:03:17.599> so<00:03:18.599> we're<00:03:18.750> go<00:03:18.900> ahead<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
events or whatever so we're go ahead and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.199 
events or whatever so we're go ahead and
mount<00:03:19.319> this<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.859> we<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:20.579> use<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.000> weight<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
mount this and we just use the weight of

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.360 
mount this and we just use the weight of
the<00:03:21.269> camera<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.689> help<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.959> slide<00:03:22.109> forward<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the camera to help it slide forward and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.179 
the camera to help it slide forward and
once<00:03:23.639> it<00:03:23.760> locks<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.719> in<00:03:24.959> position<00:03:25.439> and<00:03:25.620> it's

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
once it locks it's in position and it's

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.449 
once it locks it's in position and it's
good<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.489> go<00:03:26.699> of<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:28.379> mount<00:03:28.620> actually<00:03:29.040> holds

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
good to go of the mount actually holds

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.610 
good to go of the mount actually holds
the<00:03:29.549> weight<00:03:29.699> really<00:03:30.000> well<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:31.169> can<00:03:31.199> position

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
the weight really well you can position

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.439 
the weight really well you can position
it<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:32.250> whatever<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.819> want<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.419> can

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:41.759 
if I were to let it go right now with

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.390
