enough<00:01:15.570> common<00:01:15.869> sense<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.560> delete<00:01:17.009> game

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
enough common sense to delete game

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.109 
enough common sense to delete game
without<00:01:18.380> deleting<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.740> items<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
without deleting the items you know it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.289 
without deleting the items you know it
is<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.840> game<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.740> items<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.939> delete

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.530 
is the game and items or just delete
profile<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.340> figured<00:01:27.090> he<00:01:27.150> had<00:01:27.180> enough

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
profile only so I figured he had enough

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
profile only so I figured he had enough
sense<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:29.070> no<00:01:29.310> every<00:01:30.210> bit<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> my

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
sense to do that but no every bit of my

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.010 
sense to do that but no every bit of my
saves<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.200> every<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.100> games<00:01:32.960> may<00:01:33.960> it
