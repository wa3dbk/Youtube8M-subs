00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.570
 good morning from the kitchen you evolve and after 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.150
 the panettone proposed in two variants 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.120
 of raw food today we propose 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.190
 the hygienic aryan fruit panettone 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.520
 tool we need is a mixer 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.860
 equipped with s-shaped blade we pass 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.030
 to the ingredients three very red apples 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.240
 sweets 200 grams of dried apples 4 5 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.860
 spoons of raisins kept soaking e 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.470
 a dozen apricots drained 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.450
 dried dried apricots as 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.410
 besides the apples if you don't feel like it 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.059
 to prepare them before you can buy them 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.530
 online in the shops dedicated to raw food 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.400
 so this is the recipe extremely 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.260
 simple and fast we will not use 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.380
 spices and condiments as they are 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.850
 of a hygienist research accordingly 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.520
 also the ingredients we have 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.630
 selected are made up of three types 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 of sweet fruit 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.299
 well now let's move on to preparation 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.299
 we whisk the 200 grams of dried apples 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.540
 we got a grain of 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.270
 size not too small but 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.770
 enough to make a good dough 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.600
 add the sultanas as it is 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.790
 we do not have a hygienist recipe 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.850
 inserted between the orange ingredients e 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.980
 cedar as a sour fruit that is badly affected 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.320
 matches with the selected sweet fruit 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.840
 therefore as a base for the dough 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.540
 we will replace the candied fruit with diced 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.900
 dried fruit sweet apricots 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.060
 however visually similar to candied fruits i 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.020
 traditional classics from eco to cubes 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.440
 so we add our own so small 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:17.380
 candiedis we mix the three ingredients 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.380
 let's blend the pulp of the sails 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.200
 we incorporate fresh lamela into the mixture 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.200
 at this point we amalgamate everything well 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.400
 we whisked it at the last moment 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.300
 fresh sail because not being able to put 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.790
 the lemon oxidizes quickly then 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.450
 this is a panettone that like the gran 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.519
 part of the raw and above all dishes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.690
 Fruitarians should be consumed at the time 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:57.370
 let's now model the mixture a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.370
 form panettone 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.450
 the panettone and riana fruit hygienist is 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.069
 ready good, more evolutionary cooking a 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.069
 all to the next video recipe
