if<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.189> actually<00:02:16.340> think<00:02:16.730> why<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.239> they

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
if you actually think why would they

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.330 
if you actually think why would they
actually<00:02:17.659> have<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.019> sat<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.920> side<00:02:19.129> where

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
actually have this sat on the side where

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.399 
actually have this sat on the side where
they<00:02:19.489> actually<00:02:19.640> unboxed<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.989> juggernaut

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
they actually unboxed the juggernaut

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.890 
they actually unboxed the juggernaut
edition<00:02:21.860> mini<00:02:22.069> fridge<00:02:22.450> why<00:02:23.450> would<00:02:23.599> they<00:02:23.720> have

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
edition mini fridge why would they have

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.210 
edition mini fridge why would they have
this<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.500> side<00:02:24.650> why<00:02:24.860> would<00:02:25.010> they<00:02:25.099> have

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
this on the side why would they have

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.910 
this on the side why would they have
this<00:02:25.400> park<00:02:25.670> bottle<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.239> side<00:02:26.650> anyways<00:02:27.650> and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this park bottle on the side anyways and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.160 
this park bottle on the side anyways and
this<00:02:28.760> leads<00:02:29.000> us<00:02:29.180> on<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.420> think<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.959> there's<00:02:30.109> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this leads us on to think that there's a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.110 
this leads us on to think that there's a
brand<00:02:30.409> new<00:02:30.590> perk<00:02:30.859> for<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> shadow<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.609> evil<00:02:32.000> of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
brand new perk for the shadow of evil of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.750 
brand new perk for the shadow of evil of
course<00:02:32.390> none<00:02:32.629> of<00:02:32.659> this<00:02:32.900> has<00:02:33.140> been<00:02:33.470> confirmed

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
course none of this has been confirmed

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.220 
course none of this has been confirmed
this<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.970> all<00:02:35.090> speculation<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:35.900> i'm<00:02:36.019> pretty

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this is all speculation but i'm pretty

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.349 
this is all speculation but i'm pretty
sure<00:02:36.379> we<00:02:37.250> are<00:02:37.400> going<00:02:37.549> to<00:02:37.609> be<00:02:37.700> seeing<00:02:37.939> a<00:02:38.090> brand

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359
