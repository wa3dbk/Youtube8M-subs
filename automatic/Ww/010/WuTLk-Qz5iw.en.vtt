before<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.650> saw<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:29.700> they

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
before they saw it I don't think they

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.399 
before they saw it I don't think they
liked<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.180> too<00:01:30.329> much<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:31.110> didn't<00:01:31.350> do

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
liked it too much but they didn't do

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.270 
liked it too much but they didn't do
anything<00:01:31.530> about<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.920> didn't<00:01:32.100> ban

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
writing like that because I guess it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
writing like that because I guess it's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
own experience and that's what makes a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.390 
own experience and that's what makes a
PC<00:02:30.120> edition<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.540> Minecraft<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.200> good<00:02:31.590> compared

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to the Xbox 360 I know it's very hard to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.380 
to the Xbox 360 I know it's very hard to
run<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:34.860> computers<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.269> the

chance to play it's very very very fun

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.729 
chance to play it's very very very fun
because<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.940> how<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.599> can<00:02:39.810> custom<00:02:40.260> tailor<00:02:40.620> it

but it's going to be up to the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.699 
but it's going to be up to the
developers<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.120> implement<00:03:09.450> them<00:03:09.840> or<00:03:10.019> allow

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
them to be implemented by third party so

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.809 
them to be implemented by third party so
that<00:03:13.290> means<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.650> well<00:03:13.830> their<00:03:14.099> third<00:03:14.370> party

that means as well their third party

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.670 
that means as well their third party
policies<00:03:15.360> have<00:03:15.510> changed<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:16.019> well<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.560> can

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
policies have changed as well so you can

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.640 
policies have changed as well so you can
actually<00:03:16.859> um<00:03:17.540> install<00:03:18.540> certain<00:03:18.989> things<00:03:19.410> on

another<00:03:24.030> video<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.810> there's<00:03:24.959> gonna<00:03:25.049> be

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
another video I think there's gonna be

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.870 
another video I think there's gonna be
some<00:03:25.410> sort<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.680> file<00:03:25.890> sharing<00:03:26.160> service<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.760> know

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
some sort of file sharing service I know

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.970 
some sort of file sharing service I know
the<00:03:27.150> cloud<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.660> gonna<00:03:27.840> be<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.079> use<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the cloud is gonna be in use so that

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.620 
the cloud is gonna be in use so that
could<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> very<00:03:29.819> good<00:03:29.880> way<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.239> share

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
could be a very good way to share

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.300 
could be a very good way to share
texture<00:03:31.019> backs<00:03:31.200> share<00:03:31.500> maps<00:03:31.739> all<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.100> kind

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
texture backs share maps all that kind

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.720 
texture backs share maps all that kind
of<00:03:32.340> stuff

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
of stuff

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.400
