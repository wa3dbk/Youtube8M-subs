00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
 two things in this one when one sees the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.569
 Insolent threats from the empire 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.400
 American against our country 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.429
 the first thing he feels is indignation 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.500
 nobody in this world can come to dictate 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.080
 the guidelines to venezuela that time 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.029
 ended nobody can come to threaten 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.329
 venezuela nobody and we can not 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.340
 allow the companions to venezuela 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.680
 Respect venezuela a people of dignity 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.870
 of history 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.370
 not only can we allow them to 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.370
 nobody throw the voice to venezuela 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.050
 that touch of venezuela with the petal of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.699
 We can not afford a rose because 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 venezuela is our beloved girl 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.680
 our homeland in the first good 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
 you feel 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.579
 and the second is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.300
 repudiation 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.399
 the good empire is the empire but 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 I heard we were talking the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.480
 trip me now 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 the statements of the leaders of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 the call mud 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 here we had to pour enough water 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.010
 blessed because they left that 11 of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.750
 April here 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.160
 that I invited them here were 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.650
 sitting down that's why we change the table 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.380
 We put a new fresh table 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.170
 we put some branches or if it was left 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.020
 something out there and holy water but 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.690
 quite a few exits and smoke before 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.550
 come in for this to be 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.320
 pure blessed 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.320
 but really ashamed 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.710
 there are the two poles of strength 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.740
 when you see them 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.329
 to such an alias they call over there 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.009
 and see the statements of them 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.520
 supporting the sanctions of the government of 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.020
 us and asking for more peace sanctions and 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.170
 asking the United States to come 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.149
 here to govern the wta appropriate in 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.259
 our country one what it feels 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.909
 disgust and says without a doubt in 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.049
 Venezuela 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.520
 there are no 345 poles there are two poles the pole 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.619
 of the dignity of the homeland that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.500
 represents our Bolivarian people and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.560
 chavista and the pole of the indignity of 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.870
 the counterpart of those who are 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.319
 kneeling that the minority pole 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.319
 they are there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.330
 and this I say because we see the challenge 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.430
 challenges that we have 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.030
 the presidential councils of the government 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.120
 popular have to be tips 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.500
 presidential of the town really for 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.820
 defend dignity and independence 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.410
 from our country to build 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.900
 awareness of the battle that we are 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.460
 giving for the right to exist and to live 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.240
 from a homeland that is the homeland 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.900
 Venezuela faces threats and attempts 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.970
 of sanctions well you know that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.850
 we 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.310
 we have the conscience 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.730
 that we are defending what is 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.040
 fair 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.959
 and nobody will ever scare us 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 we look down at him or the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.709
 in front of nobody in this world to anyone in 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.709
 this world nobody owe you anything 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.840
 very sad the paper that has finished 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.790
 playing water sadder 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.770
 it's not because we made ourselves a great 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.810
 expectation never 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.410
 but sad especially for the people of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.360
 USA 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.080
 for the American youth that the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.080
 they are killing 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.680
 and do not ask yourself what is in the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.230
 can then 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
 obama has preferred to live as the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.640
 commander chÃ¡vez but to be in 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.010
 the power then 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.069
 to be an accomplice to the abuses of his 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.530
 own people president obama to be 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.700
 accomplice of the murder of the own 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.160
 young African-American people like you 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.730

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.319

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.660
 aggressions against this venezuela 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.400
 democratic and Bolivarian for that to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.910
 that is in the presidency of the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.910
 republic 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.980
 and these are the crunchiest topics 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.040
 present 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.359
