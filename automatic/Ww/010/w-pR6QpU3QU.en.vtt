00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello and welcome to the guide of 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.050
 Proteins for a new test product 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.330
 in this video I told you about the jack 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.769
 3d micro of the usb the front and also 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.420
 try to make the comparison between 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.750
 the old version and the new 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.670
 version 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.429
 so remember the old version of the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.199
 day 3 of the microphones contained dr at a 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.339
 very effective product but that is 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.289
 now banned because he's 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.999
 considered a doping product so 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.060
 this old version had the 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:31.399
 dm aa caffeine from the creatine of the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.050
 betanin and other ingredients there 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.260
 could have tested at the time when this 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.270
 product was allowed and so what 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.140
 I could feel it was 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.030
 the increase in energy and 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.950
 endurance so pretty much like 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.810
 arrive all booster with more 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.790
 a very significant effect at the level of 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.650
 muscle burn that is to say that 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.120
 on series where he used to 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.680
 to approach very strong feeling of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.270
 burn that he could even sometimes 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.650
 embarrass to focus well on the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.670
 movement 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.050
 so as a series of fifteen open 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.640
 the appetite on a pond 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.239
 course by testing the job 3d version with 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 from dr to 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.440
 I had more is burning there and did it 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.090
 the effect was really very very 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.890
 significant to the glassware on all 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.260
 the series from the warm up I 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.210
 felt this effect there so there was 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.640
 really an effect different from the others 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.830
 booster that I could test now 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 on the new version we no longer have the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.420
 starts is longer aline metal over 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.610
 creatine by cons we have arginine 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 we have citrulline so these two 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.450
 ingredients are there to improve the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.520
 congestion but knowing that on a dose 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.780
 we have just over 2 grams of these 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.190
 ingredients there so what's up to my 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.140
 notice a little do lift the congestion 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.429
 after in terms of stimulants we will see 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.270
 caffeine the sicafi khl knowing that 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.740
 to ask a little bit the question 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.119
 also kÃ¤fig coy because a priori 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.190
 so calm a little further north six 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.380
 that a stimulant varying from 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.640
 to do the test while hamburg week 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.210
 Norman products he fully under 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.619
 blister 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.710
 and then then there is also a small 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.090
 opercules so the pod take weighs 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.210
 the more than 3 g 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.409
 we will put 200 milliliters of water then 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:09.770
 here I am on a fruit scent 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:10.819
 ugly we do not need to mix 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.520
 a lot but there is no foam not 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.420
 hence the word is the same smell as the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.420
 most fried products board 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.300
 this very good the taste is very good so 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.620
 not we will pay a very good taste 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.150
 now i'm going to finish my check 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.410
 and then we meet again 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.650
 the gym to have the effects 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.450
 So this product to the gym 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.370
 at the end of the triceps biceps session 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.500
 for the rest of the test that jack roy's 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.239
 sp lab purpose mics then the effect the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.660
 more blatant for me what I could 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.849
 feel 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.290
 and contrary to what to what I 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.120
 was waiting for me to read the ingredients 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.769
 it's a very good question to report 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.510
 so usually on it was 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.489
 the pleasant surprise of this product after 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.230
 stimulation energy term a little 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.450
 more energy than usual but a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.739
 effect still much less pronounced 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.989
 that I have what I could have felt 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.910
 with the product that contained dr ah 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.579
 and then there is little and no more this effect 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.120
 anti burns that I could have with the 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.079
 previous version where chuck 3d so in 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.150
 test report 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.620
 I already have three microphones what I 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.959
 can say is that indeed I have 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.430
 felt a little improvement of art 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.440
 of energy as well in force as 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.360
 endurance a good improvement on 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.310
 congestion but actually there 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.049
 has no stimulating effect very 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.299
 important that we could have with the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.680
 previous version of the 3d jack nor the effect 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.170
 really impressive about the appearance 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.510
 draft muscle but also the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.400
 counterpart on it is that the fact 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.260
 of this stimulation a little less we 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.790
 also has less fatigue and the greenhouse 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.049
 unlike some industry 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.720
 hours after entering me I think them 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.400
 of backlash while with this 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 version I really felt like a 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.019
 very significant backlash after the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.600
 meeting 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.180
 so for me the points to remember from this 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.709
 produces a noticeable increase in energy 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.359
 better congestion and no 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.650
 backlash now I give you 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.630
 go on guy protein point 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.040
 org section tests and reviews to have 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.750
 all the details about this product and about 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.639
 this test our tips for use and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.639
 of course all our self test
