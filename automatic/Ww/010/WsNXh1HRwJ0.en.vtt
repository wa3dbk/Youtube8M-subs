 possible but rend sorry I'm not 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
 getting a job was very tiring 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.279
 week run are now much can 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.240
 bring you here I hope you 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.179
 do not understand 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.249
 but come another time is a mmo is ok 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.259
 a simultaneous play online is a game of 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.820
 massive online multiplayer of countless 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.309
 people can play at the same time 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.739
 example, almost 30 people are 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.870
 same time playing battle with each other 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.309
 I can and as the name says Rodolfo 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.750
 tanks is a multiplayer where you play 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.550
 with tanks, right? 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.190
 tanks between the first and second 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.660
 world war to date are the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.579
 tanks that find and have tanks 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.649
 more modern more ahead I do not know 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.120
 I did not get there but you blank 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.410
 control the tank you will win 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.179
 experience you're making money 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.609
 you will enable more and more 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.449
 upgrades plus special 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.789
 tanks 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.470
 I played very interesting and very addictive 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.720
 do not be fooled by the degree 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.820
 simple graphics of them even because the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.890
 intention is not you to hold cpi by 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.170
 graphic and the province with the game 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.299
 provides for being a multiplayer game 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.070
 so there's going to be a lot of people playing 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.170
 that you can be sure of that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.750
 It's a very interesting game, well done. 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.579
 interesting and cloud start is like this 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.619
 thing that I perceived as the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.049
 Cubans caught half of the game I found half 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.700
 of the commands but are not really 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.070
 the game commands without the commands of the 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.960
 tank I was controlling because 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.579
 each tank has the mobility party 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.200
 strong point a weakness then you 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.180
 have to know how to choose the one who 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.420
 adapt to what you want to play the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.950
 way of your game style and then 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.540
 Are you going to play more and more tanks? 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.070
 more skill, you're improving it 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.799
 will improving the game commands then in 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.869
 truth is not the controls of the game 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.490
 which are bad and the tank controls in 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.979
 specific you will be commanding 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.590
 and as said graph is not the strong point 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.780
 of the game but the fun the level of addiction 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 yes, it is certainly because it does not 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 put faith 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.050
 I started to play I started to win some 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.760
 battles there I started evolving in the game 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.410
 started to give me more and more interest 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.840
 to continue playing golf shoes for 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.640
 find out how far I can go 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.129
 What are the new tanks I can 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.120
 open what I can do this game 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.800
 interesting thing you can do is 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.580
 form a group and play a group you and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.530
 your friends or against us finally gives 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.989
 You do number and yes it 's with 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.430
 combinations of battle let's say if 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.290
 you can divide it into two teams you 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.989
 You can call inviting friends to play 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.480
 against the game very interesting well cool 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.310
 Even if it's free, do not take Brazil. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440
 the download is very small 70 meters 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.019
 just but after you're low 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.239
 game will download the maps there that it takes 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.970
 a little bit but nothing so exaggerated 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.890
 but it is a very interesting game, very cool 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.470
 Even as I said the battles are 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.630
 so you do not have the backing 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.470
 if you are destroyed your tank was 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.120
 destroyed 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.950
 Are you going back to the waiting room? 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.829
 will choose another tank for you 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.549
 wait in line until you are 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.019
 replaced in a room sometimes 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.680
 Instant sometimes have to wait a 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.329
 a little 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.819
 The masp and I waited a minute and a half 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.129
 to have almost 1500 people in the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.470
 my front to be able to be replaced 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.950
 in other matches and the goal of the game is 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.720
 It's really simple, it 's basically you. 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.760
 Destroy enemies as more friends 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.010
 you always score more and you win 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.319
 main goal is to get to the 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.150
 enemy base that is marked on the map by 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.700
 your red flag in the case of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.230
 green flag get there and master base 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.030
 of the enemy and if on the way you 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 get enough tanks better 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.810
 for you that you are winning every time 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.540
 more experience points more money 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.010
 so you can switch with the upgrade by 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.560
 new tank models 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.000
 but that's not all what you earn 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.700
 skill and experience points 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.139
 also in the game as it says 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.120
 tank has different mobility we have 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.940
 anti -tank lightweight tanks 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.560
 heavy artillery at last each one 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.569
 has his ability for example has a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.010
 observation tank if not 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.169
 I'm not kidding the tanks of genres in the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.180
 boy and he has a speed bonus 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.400
 of field of vision or be as you 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.470
 go walking map of you only because of 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.180
 you find other enemies 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.040
 You already gain experience that you will 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.349
 telling the team's friends 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.840
 position him level with attacking where 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.120
 attack them and it's cool, too. 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.920
 keep an eye on the crosshair of the mass 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.780
 about the game 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.670
 She and the team look good to you . 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.870
 according to the level of the tank you 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.490
 are playing 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.530
 as you look at an enemy at a 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.910
 retreat can stay white yellow orange 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.070
 or red 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.320
 each of these Indian colors 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.620
 damage you can cause an enemy and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.810
 Do not be smart, you have. 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.460
 countless ways you can make your 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.830
 for example you can try 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.180
 discover the weaknesses of each 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.980
 Each tank has a weak spot. 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.930
 every tank is a strong point like me 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.180
 said it's pretty cool, very interesting. 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.390
 simple game does not have much to think only 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.040
 you play like this and try to do 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.470
 your strategy us in your way you 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.390
 want to be the branch type you do if you 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.900
 you want to be the sneaky type you will have 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.430
 you can hide your tank and some 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.960
 of the many who have a game in the trees 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.460
 Do you hide the tank? 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.130
 you become more difficult to be 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.170
 detected you can make a player of 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.630
 team for example to call friends you 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.070
 will only open in the eleven thus a map in 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.040
 against enemies while your friends 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.750
 of the divine they or vice versa anyway a 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.280
 game very interesting, cool 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.900
 worth you're the son not 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.790
 more for being free, right? 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.890
 But I hope you liked it. 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.850
 of the video that background match was a 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.500
 The best of what I did explained 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.450
 leaving the game running for you is 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.860
 spread the year with a retail panzer 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.080
 It has three types of tank of the tank 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.240
 Americans from the Allies and Germans 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.310
 Nazis in the case in the beginning are the three 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.140
 factions you can choose from 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.090
 tanks so you can play né 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.340
 this program a panzer a German tank 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.290
 well cool, strong, so much pressure on 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.030
 start is not available only as 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.220
 You will be unlocking more and more 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.990
 ability you unlock is also a 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.360
 good start tank recommend 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.530
 play with it and that's what hope 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.120
 Did you like the video? 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.550
 thing I say I said with a bullshit 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.390
 Correct me there, please, and until the next 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.390
 we talked
