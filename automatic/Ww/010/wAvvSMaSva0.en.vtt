inside too and now here are your reeds

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.970 
inside too and now here are your reeds
as<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.390> can<00:03:50.540> see<00:03:50.780> minor<00:03:52.900> kind<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:54.049> honeycomb

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
as you can see minor kind of honeycomb

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.979 
as you can see minor kind of honeycomb
pattern<00:03:55.310> on<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.849> inside<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.390> looks<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.930> not

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
pattern on the inside it looks it's not

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.500 
pattern on the inside it looks it's not
a<00:04:00.140> good<00:04:00.379> thing<00:04:00.620> that's<00:04:00.830> just<00:04:01.010> teary<00:04:01.940> eration

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
a good thing that's just teary eration

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.320 
a good thing that's just teary eration
but<00:04:03.200> then<00:04:03.349> again<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.890> take<00:04:04.640> such<00:04:04.849> good<00:04:05.030> care<00:04:05.090> of

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
but then again I take such good care of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.740 
but then again I take such good care of
my<00:04:05.510> air<00:04:05.660> filter<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:07.160> no<00:04:07.879> dirt<00:04:08.180> ever<00:04:08.420> gets

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
my air filter that no dirt ever gets

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.619 
my air filter that no dirt ever gets
through<00:04:09.049> so<00:04:09.290> that's<00:04:09.470> all<00:04:09.739> perfect<00:04:10.329> then<00:04:11.329> again

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
through so that's all perfect then again

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.740 
through so that's all perfect then again
it's<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.379> old<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.769> all<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.040> gashes

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
it's just so old that all the gashes

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.729 
it's just so old that all the gashes
ruin<00:04:14.750> that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.260 

the<00:04:21.739> first<00:04:21.979> step<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.400> actually<00:04:22.550> getting<00:04:23.060> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the first step to actually getting the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.540 
the first step to actually getting the
reed<00:04:23.449> petals<00:04:23.870> off<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:25.400> want<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:26.210> see<00:04:26.449> how

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.800 

those<00:04:32.550> are<00:04:32.759> two<00:04:32.969> different<00:04:33.000> parts<00:04:33.479> right

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
those are two different parts right

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.529 
those are two different parts right

you have to do is really make it work
well<00:05:54.779> first<00:05:55.050> of<00:05:55.169> all<00:05:55.520> these<00:05:56.520> are<00:05:56.669> going<00:05:56.819> to<00:05:56.909> be

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
well first of all these are going to be

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.579 
well first of all these are going to be
split<00:05:57.539> apart

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
split apart

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.439 
split apart
you<00:05:58.740> got<00:05:58.919> to<00:05:59.039> split<00:05:59.219> these<00:05:59.400> apart<00:05:59.789> so<00:06:00.029> put<00:06:00.330> it

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
you got to split these apart so put it

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.260 
you got to split these apart so put it
in<00:06:00.539> with<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.409> short<00:06:01.860> side<00:06:02.159> down<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.759> split<00:06:03.150> it

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
in with a short side down to split it

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.730 
in with a short side down to split it
down<00:06:04.139> spread<00:06:04.919> it<00:06:05.069> apart<00:06:05.339> and<00:06:05.550> then<00:06:06.740> once

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
down spread it apart and then once

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.920 
down spread it apart and then once
that's<00:06:08.699> down<00:06:09.150> all<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.539> way

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
that's down all the way

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.990 
that's down all the way
what<00:06:10.469> it's<00:06:10.620> going<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.800> do<00:06:11.039> is<00:06:11.219> it's<00:06:11.430> this<00:06:12.419> is

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
what it's going to do is it's this is

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.420 
what it's going to do is it's this is
going<00:06:15.000> to<00:06:15.180> flush<00:06:15.569> up<00:06:15.810> against<00:06:16.349> it<00:06:16.500> it's<00:06:17.250> going

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
going to flush up against it it's going

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.519 
going to flush up against it it's going
to<00:06:17.520> pop<00:06:17.729> into<00:06:18.000> place<00:06:18.150> like<00:06:18.719> it's<00:06:18.900> supposed<00:06:19.319> to

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
to pop into place like it's supposed to

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:25.429 
to pop into place like it's supposed to
and<00:06:19.770> then<00:06:20.759> once<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.150> happens<00:06:24.289> once<00:06:25.289> it's

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:25.439 
and then once that happens once it's

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.610 
and then once that happens once it's
popped<00:06:25.710> into<00:06:25.949> place<00:06:26.509> then<00:06:27.509> you<00:06:28.139> make<00:06:28.349> sure

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
popped into place then you make sure

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.450 
popped into place then you make sure
that<00:06:28.919> you<00:06:29.039> put<00:06:29.279> it<00:06:29.310> down<00:06:29.750> before<00:06:31.099> that<00:06:32.099> tab

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
that you put it down before that tab

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.890 
that you put it down before that tab
right<00:06:32.729> there<00:06:32.759> and<00:06:33.500> push<00:06:34.500> it<00:06:35.270> right<00:06:36.270> across<00:06:36.539> it

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
right there and push it right across it

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.279 
right there and push it right across it
because<00:06:37.710> if<00:06:37.919> you<00:06:38.069> go<00:06:38.279> too<00:06:38.789> far<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.419> you<00:06:39.509> go<00:06:40.139> on

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
because if you go too far and you go on

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.340 
because if you go too far and you go on
top<00:06:40.560> of<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.860> tab<00:06:41.130> and<00:06:41.520> try<00:06:41.819> pushing<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.389> down

top of the tab and try pushing it down

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.650 
top of the tab and try pushing it down
it's<00:06:43.470> not<00:06:43.980> going<00:06:44.280> to<00:06:44.370> go<00:06:44.520> it<00:06:45.060> won't<00:06:45.390> go<00:06:45.630> in

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
between that tab so make sure you pry

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.120 
between that tab so make sure you pry
them<00:06:49.530> apart

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
them apart

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.360 
them apart
push<00:06:50.670> down<00:06:50.940> 45<00:06:51.480> degrees<00:06:51.810> and<00:06:52.140> then<00:06:52.830> bring<00:06:53.250> it
