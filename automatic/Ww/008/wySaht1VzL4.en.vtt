sometimes I do notice that that the AI

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.610 
sometimes I do notice that that the AI
will<00:01:46.060> step<00:01:46.330> over<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.690> blue<00:01:46.840> line<00:01:46.870> before<00:01:47.530> the

it<00:02:03.100> going<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.970> prevent<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.110> AI<00:02:05.140> from<00:02:05.619> going

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
it going to prevent the AI from going

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.600 
it going to prevent the AI from going
off<00:02:06.369> side<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:07.750> gonna<00:02:07.900> say<00:02:08.200> no<00:02:08.440> but<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.190> think

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
off side I'm gonna say no but I think

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.910 
off side I'm gonna say no but I think
it's<00:02:09.790> going<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.179> prevent<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.869> AI<00:02:10.899> from<00:02:11.350> going

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
it's going to prevent the AI from going

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.210 
it's going to prevent the AI from going
offside<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.270> rush<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.860> rush<00:02:15.070> it

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
offside on the rush so on the rush it

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.790 
offside on the rush so on the rush it
hasn't<00:02:15.580> happened<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.000> me<00:02:16.030> too<00:02:16.480> often<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.260> day

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
hasn't happened to me too often that day

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.949 
hasn't happened to me too often that day
I<00:02:17.830> will<00:02:18.610> go<00:02:18.790> outside<00:02:18.940> like<00:02:19.390> said<00:02:19.660> but

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
I will go outside like said but

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.520 
I will go outside like said but
hopefully<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.709> new<00:02:20.980> mechanic<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> game

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
hopefully this new mechanic in the game

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.130 
hopefully this new mechanic in the game
well<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.560> know<00:02:23.860> permit<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.550> because<00:02:24.790> it's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
well you know permit that because it's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.900 
well you know permit that because it's
you<00:02:26.140> never<00:02:26.410> want<00:02:26.830> something<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.430> happen<00:02:27.610> in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
play you want that to reflect in the AI

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.320 
play you want that to reflect in the AI
also<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.040> don't<00:02:48.250> want<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> AI<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.760> basically

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
also you don't want the AI to basically

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.930 
also you don't want the AI to basically
be<00:02:49.570> dragging<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.049> down<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.489> second

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
now that may be a hard word for me to

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.430 
now that may be a hard word for me to
say<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:59.880> anticipation<00:03:00.880> AI<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.660> basically

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
say but anticipation AI is basically

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.670 
say but anticipation AI is basically
what<00:03:02.590> they<00:03:02.709> call<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:04.360> all<00:03:04.570> about<00:03:04.840> how

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
what they call it and it's all about how

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.229 
what they call it and it's all about how
the<00:03:05.739> AI<00:03:06.190> plays<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:08.110> AI<00:03:08.350> basically<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.670> NHL<00:03:10.150> 11

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
the AI plays the AI basically in NHL 11

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.479 
the AI plays the AI basically in NHL 11
they<00:03:10.660> give<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.959> comparison<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.739> this<00:03:11.830> video

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
they give you a comparison in this video

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.750 
they give you a comparison in this video
NHL<00:03:13.180> 11<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:14.080> was<00:03:14.320> programmed<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:15.130> my<00:03:15.459> knowledge

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
NHL 11 it was programmed to my knowledge

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.170 
NHL 11 it was programmed to my knowledge
that<00:03:16.450> when<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.959> got<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.260> puck<00:03:17.500> your<00:03:18.160> AI<00:03:18.370> said

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
that when you got the puck your AI said

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
that when you got the puck your AI said
okay<00:03:19.540> we<00:03:19.840> have<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.110> puck<00:03:20.320> let's<00:03:20.739> go

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
okay we have the puck let's go

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.720 
okay we have the puck let's go
there's<00:03:22.200> no<00:03:22.470> uh<00:03:22.500> there<00:03:22.920> was<00:03:23.010> no<00:03:23.130> mechanic<00:03:23.640> in

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
there's no uh there was no mechanic in

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.790 
there's no uh there was no mechanic in
the<00:03:23.849> game<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.239> said<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.660> right<00:03:24.720> my<00:03:25.500> player

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
the game that said all right my player

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.400 
the game that said all right my player
is<00:03:26.040> close<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.700> puck<00:03:26.910> he's<00:03:27.540> most<00:03:27.930> likely

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
is close to the puck he's most likely

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.400 
is close to the puck he's most likely
gonna<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.920> poxy<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.550> 95%<00:03:30.420> chance<00:03:31.020> of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
gonna get the poxy have a 95% chance of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.800 
gonna get the poxy have a 95% chance of
getting<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> puck<00:03:32.010> let's<00:03:32.760> turn<00:03:33.150> around<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
getting the puck let's turn around and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
getting the puck let's turn around and
let's<00:03:33.989> skate<00:03:34.349> up<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> ice<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.430> didn't

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
let's skate up the ice that didn't

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.339 
let's skate up the ice that didn't
happen<00:03:36.239> man<00:03:36.810> HL<00:03:37.170> 11<00:03:37.349> which<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.280> believe<00:03:38.610> you

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
happen man HL 11 which I believe you

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.140 
happen man HL 11 which I believe you
know<00:03:40.349> kind<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.709> hinders<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.220> breakaways<00:03:41.790> cuz

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
know kind of hinders the breakaways cuz

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.300 
know kind of hinders the breakaways cuz
there<00:03:42.330> there's<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.019> lot<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.560> break<00:03:43.950> wait<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
there there's not a lot of break wait a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.949 
there there's not a lot of break wait a
minute<00:03:44.700> I'll<00:03:44.849> let<00:03:45.120> them<00:03:45.239> compare<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.720> NHL<00:03:47.959> but

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
minute I'll let them compare the NHL but

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.190 
minute I'll let them compare the NHL but
in<00:03:49.830> NHL<00:03:50.400> 12<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.239> give<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.510> an<00:03:51.599> example<00:03:51.989> of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
in NHL 12 to give you an example of

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.229 
in NHL 12 to give you an example of
Ovechkin<00:03:52.830> okay<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.250> defenseman<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.120> know

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
Ovechkin okay the defenseman is you know

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.690 
Ovechkin okay the defenseman is you know
ten<00:03:55.110> feet<00:03:55.380> away<00:03:55.470> from<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> puck<00:03:56.100> with<00:03:56.310> no<00:03:56.519> one

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
ten feet away from the puck with no one

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
ten feet away from the puck with no one
around<00:03:56.819> them<00:03:57.209> okay<00:03:57.810> well<00:03:58.080> he's<00:03:58.709> most<00:03:58.920> likely

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
around them okay well he's most likely

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.190 
around them okay well he's most likely
gonna<00:03:59.340> get<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.670> puck<00:03:59.880> sole<00:04:00.480> engine<00:04:00.720> turns

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
gonna get the puck sole engine turns

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.559 
gonna get the puck sole engine turns
around<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.769> starts<00:04:02.069> speeding<00:04:02.880> up<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.420> ice

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
around and starts speeding up the ice
