00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
about the cube and I think what Brandon

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
about the cube and I think what Brandon
Lily<00:00:28.260> pushes<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> practicing<00:00:29.699> your<00:00:29.789> sport

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you know we we deadlift with a straight

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
you know we we deadlift with a straight
wait<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.100> swap<00:00:35.640> straight<00:00:35.910> wait<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.270> bench<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
wait we swap straight wait we bench the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.760 
wait we swap straight wait we bench the
straight<00:00:36.750> wait<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
straight wait and that was one of the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.990 
straight wait and that was one of the
biggest<00:00:37.890> things<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.640> deadlift

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
biggest things that how my deadlift

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
biggest things that how my deadlift
shoot<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.540> their<00:00:39.809> own<00:00:39.930> spin<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.320> things

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
shoot up was their own spin on things

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.010 
shoot up was their own spin on things
but<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:42.030> cube<00:00:42.360> method<00:00:42.809> when<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
but I like about the cube method when I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.819 
but I like about the cube method when I
like<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:44.000> lily<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.480> even<00:00:46.050> west<00:00:46.289> side<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
like about lily and even west side and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.650 
like about lily and even west side and
things<00:00:47.070> Louise<00:00:47.370> brought<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.300> getting

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
things Louise brought up it just getting

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940 
things Louise brought up it just getting
more<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.050> people<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
more and more people out there to think

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
more and more people out there to think
about<00:00:50.100> their<00:00:50.430> training<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:51.930> how

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
about their training and think about how

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
about their training and think about how
they<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.469> execute<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.719> mold<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> these

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
they can execute and mold some of these

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.939 
they can execute and mold some of these
things<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.390> their<00:00:57.539> own<00:00:57.750> training<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.800> make

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
things to their own training and to make

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
things to their own training and to make
their<00:00:59.129> own<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> refine<00:00:59.820> their<00:01:00.059> own<00:01:00.210> training

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
their own to refine their own training

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.229 
their own to refine their own training
to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> optimal<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.129> themselves<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> think

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to be optimal for themselves and I think

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
to be optimal for themselves and I think
that's<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.840> key<00:01:04.049> you're<00:01:04.739> talking

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that's really the key you're talking

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.200 
that's really the key you're talking
about<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.220> different<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.820> pushing<00:01:06.150> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
about these different I be pushing it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
about these different I be pushing it
too<00:01:06.420> hard<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:07.020> somehow<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.159> recovering

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
too hard right somehow not recovering

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
too hard right somehow not recovering
very<00:01:08.790> well<00:01:08.970> well<00:01:09.360> you're<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> impede<00:01:10.049> on

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
very well well you're going to impede on

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
very well well you're going to impede on
the<00:01:10.409> intent<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> day<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.729> when

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the intent of the day and that's when

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
the intent of the day and that's when
you<00:01:12.030> will<00:01:12.119> say<00:01:12.299> about<00:01:12.479> power<00:01:13.200> lifters<00:01:13.500> not

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you will say about power lifters not

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050 
you will say about power lifters not
comparing<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.280> mean<00:01:14.490> part<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> things<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
comparing I mean part of the things of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
comparing I mean part of the things of
sport<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> why<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.500> take<00:01:16.740> things

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
sport and why don't they take things

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
sport and why don't they take things
from<00:01:17.070> other<00:01:17.250> sports<00:01:17.549> obviously<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
from other sports obviously you don't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899 
from other sports obviously you don't
