00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
fit inside this so that will fit in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
fit inside this so that will fit in
there<00:01:21.869> let's<00:01:22.259> say<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> knife<00:01:23.610> or

together and maybe a knife and that's
going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.720> bundle<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.520> take<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

say<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.670> doing<00:01:35.909> these<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.240> take

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
say I'm just doing these two take

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.700 
say I'm just doing these two take
picture<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> both<00:01:37.799> these<00:01:38.009> items<00:01:38.400> together<00:01:39.710> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
picture of both these items together and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
picture of both these items together and
then<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> take<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> picture<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.729> each<00:01:42.210> one

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
then I take a picture of each one

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.719 
then I take a picture of each one
separately<00:01:42.810> maybe<00:01:43.590> even<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> backs<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.460> I'm

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
separately maybe even the backs if I'm

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.670 
separately maybe even the backs if I'm
creating<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.149> new<00:01:45.299> listing<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
creating a new listing for it so that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
creating a new listing for it so that
the<00:01:47.009> buyer<00:01:47.310> has<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:48.299> idea<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> exactly<00:01:48.869> what

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the buyer has an idea of exactly what

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.149 
the buyer has an idea of exactly what
they're<00:01:49.680> getting

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
they're getting

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.219 
they're getting
obviously<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> take<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> tags<00:01:51.750> off<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.140> they

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
obviously I take the tags off so they

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.580 
obviously I take the tags off so they
don't<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> price<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.040> paid<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.590> so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
don't know the price I paid for but so

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
don't know the price I paid for but so
first<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.450> all

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
first I do that so then I have it all

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.050 
first I do that so then I have it all
ready<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.460> need<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> cover<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.909> the
