hi I'm Tim art and we just successfully

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.860 
hi I'm Tim art and we just successfully
took<00:00:09.340> down<00:00:09.580> a<00:00:09.610> tree<00:00:09.940> placing<00:00:10.420> it<00:00:10.510> almost

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
took down a tree placing it almost

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.500 
took down a tree placing it almost
exactly<00:00:11.350> where<00:00:11.650> we<00:00:11.770> wanted<00:00:12.040> it<00:00:12.190> to<00:00:12.280> be<00:00:12.549> two

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
exactly where we wanted it to be two

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.330 
exactly where we wanted it to be two
things<00:00:13.750> very<00:00:14.050> important<00:00:14.679> when<00:00:14.800> we<00:00:14.920> start<00:00:15.190> to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
things very important when we start to

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.010 
things very important when we start to
look<00:00:15.370> at<00:00:15.580> taking<00:00:15.820> down<00:00:16.029> a<00:00:16.090> tree<00:00:16.420> first<00:00:16.750> of<00:00:16.900> all

safety and a good plan let's take a look
at<00:00:20.200> some<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.560> basics<00:00:21.099> to<00:00:21.490> where<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.789> too

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
at some of the basics to where you too

during the fall we're going to go back

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.760 
during the fall we're going to go back
through<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.510> steps<00:00:37.809> of<00:00:38.020> establishing<00:00:38.739> that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
through the steps of establishing that

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.270 
through the steps of establishing that
hinge<00:00:39.219> by<00:00:39.730> creating<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.300> face<00:00:40.510> notch<00:00:40.809> by<00:00:41.680> making

of<00:00:45.430> this<00:00:45.550> works<00:00:45.879> off<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.329> plan<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:47.140> we

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
of this works off of the plan that we

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.799 
of this works off of the plan that we
make<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.860> be<00:00:47.980> able<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.219> get<00:00:48.430> our<00:00:48.550> results<00:00:48.809> our

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
make to be able to get our results our

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.360 
make to be able to get our results our
first<00:00:50.079> step<00:00:50.320> will<00:00:50.500> be<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.649> look<00:00:50.950> for<00:00:51.160> hazards

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
first step will be to look for hazards

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.940 
first step will be to look for hazards
or<00:00:51.760> obstacles<00:00:52.360> on<00:00:52.539> this<00:00:52.660> tree<00:00:52.989> if<00:00:53.410> we<00:00:53.590> plan<00:00:53.800> to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
or obstacles on this tree if we plan to

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.279 
or obstacles on this tree if we plan to
place<00:00:54.129> it<00:00:54.309> on<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.550> ground<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.090> first<00:00:56.050> thing

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
place it on the ground so first thing

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.680 
place it on the ground so first thing
these<00:00:56.590> vines<00:00:56.949> definitely<00:00:57.579> have<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.910> go<00:00:58.090> next

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
these vines definitely have to go next

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.420 
these vines definitely have to go next
we<00:00:58.930> want<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.170> look<00:00:59.230> for<00:00:59.559> any<00:00:59.739> types<00:01:00.100> of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
we want to look for any types of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.180

obstacles<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.539> might<00:01:01.719> be<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.170> way<00:01:02.320> we<00:01:03.039> have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
obstacles it might be in the way we have

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.010 
obstacles it might be in the way we have
a<00:01:03.219> house<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.850> this<00:01:04.000> side<00:01:04.300> look<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:04.750> any

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
a house to this side look for any

a house to this side look for any
powerline<00:01:05.680> situations<00:01:06.520> but<00:01:07.060> basically<00:01:07.539> we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
powerline situations but basically we

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.240 
powerline situations but basically we
want<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:07.930> try<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.170> put<00:01:08.440> this<00:01:08.590> tree<00:01:08.860> between

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
want to try to put this tree between

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.580 
want to try to put this tree between
those<00:01:09.520> two<00:01:09.760> trees<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.630> place<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.110> marker<00:01:11.560> out

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
those two trees we place the marker out

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.160 
those two trees we place the marker out
just<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.310> right<00:01:12.549> side<00:01:12.970> we'll<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.659> using

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
just to the right side we'll be using

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.429 
just to the right side we'll be using
that<00:01:14.320> for<00:01:14.380> our<00:01:14.740> target<00:01:15.250> reference<00:01:16.140> step<00:01:17.140> two

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
that for our target reference step two

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.160 
that for our target reference step two
we<00:01:17.979> must<00:01:18.189> establish<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:19.060> lien<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.659> this<00:01:19.900> tree

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
we must establish the lien of this tree

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.469 
we must establish the lien of this tree
in<00:01:20.490> relationship<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.790> position<00:01:22.299> that

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
in relationship to the position that

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.560 
in relationship to the position that
we'd<00:01:22.659> like<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.869> place<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:24.580> do<00:01:24.759> that<00:01:25.000> I'd

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
we'd like to place it and to do that I'd

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.539 
we'd like to place it and to do that I'd
like<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.960> place<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.380> center<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.070> crown<00:01:27.340> of

direction of the target or away so we do

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.260

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
line it to the ground in this case that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.390 
line it to the ground in this case that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.420 
line falls behind our hinge area of our
tree<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:39.080> comes<00:02:39.440> back<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.709> about<00:02:40.130> two

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
tree and it comes back to about two

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.390 
tree and it comes back to about two
two-and-a-half<00:02:40.910> feet<00:02:41.350> behind<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.590> tree<00:02:42.800> so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
two-and-a-half feet behind the tree so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.199 
two-and-a-half feet behind the tree so
that<00:02:43.430> means<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.910> tree<00:02:44.150> has<00:02:44.480> back<00:02:45.020> lean<00:02:46.209> step

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
that means this tree has back lean step

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.060 
that means this tree has back lean step
three<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:47.720> we<00:02:47.930> need<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.200> plan<00:02:48.470> our<00:02:48.890> escape

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
three now we need to plan our escape

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.490 
three now we need to plan our escape
route<00:02:49.610> our<00:02:49.910> planned<00:02:50.209> retreat<00:02:50.690> path<00:02:50.959> once<00:02:51.320> this

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
route our planned retreat path once this

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.310 
route our planned retreat path once this
tree<00:02:51.800> starts<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.250> move<00:02:52.489> so<00:02:53.360> we<00:02:53.810> want<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.140> try<00:02:54.260> to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
tree starts to move so we want to try to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.040 
tree starts to move so we want to try to
move<00:02:54.590> away<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.580> away<00:02:55.880> from<00:02:56.150> lean<00:02:56.360> side<00:02:56.720> our

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
move away on the away from lean side our

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.500 
move away on the away from lean side our
good<00:02:57.290> side<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.770> tree<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.250> minimum<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.060> 15

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.870 
good side of the tree a minimum of 15
feet<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.709> do<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.370> must<00:03:01.400> make<00:03:01.820> sure

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
feet and to do that we must make sure

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.729 
feet and to do that we must make sure
there's<00:03:02.180> no<00:03:02.270> trip<00:03:02.540> hazards<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.590> have

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
there's no trip hazards and that we have

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.090 
there's no trip hazards and that we have
our<00:03:03.920> plans<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:04.610> our<00:03:04.760> steps<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.930> here<00:03:06.380> out<00:03:06.830> in

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
our plans for our steps so here out in

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.790 
our plans for our steps so here out in
this<00:03:07.250> direction<00:03:07.459> 45<00:03:08.450> degrees<00:03:08.900> would<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.650> our

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
this direction 45 degrees would be our

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.120 
this direction 45 degrees would be our
planned<00:03:10.070> retreat<00:03:10.489> path<00:03:11.230> okay<00:03:12.230> step<00:03:12.530> 4<00:03:12.770> we<00:03:12.980> need

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
planned retreat path okay step 4 we need

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.220 
planned retreat path okay step 4 we need
to<00:03:13.250> take<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> look<00:03:13.700> at<00:03:13.940> establishing<00:03:14.750> our<00:03:14.900> hinge

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
to take a look at establishing our hinge

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.229 
to take a look at establishing our hinge
and<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.520> need<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> face

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
and to do that we need to have a face

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.140 
and to do that we need to have a face
notch<00:03:17.540> industry<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.350> allow<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.890> work<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.730> we

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
notch industry to allow it to work so we

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.720 
notch industry to allow it to work so we
need<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.360> notch<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.900> 70<00:03:21.320> degrees<00:03:21.350> open<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.190> it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
need a notch of 70 degrees open and it

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.130 
need a notch of 70 degrees open and it
needs<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.030> be<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.269> length<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.930> knotch

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
needs to be a length of the knotch

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.740 
needs to be a length of the knotch
roughly<00:03:24.890> 80%<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.790> diameter<00:03:26.120> of<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.510> tree

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
roughly 80% of the diameter of the tree

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.780 
roughly 80% of the diameter of the tree
so<00:03:27.350> here<00:03:27.560> we<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:27.860> about<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.160> hundred<00:03:28.610> percent

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so here we have about a hundred percent

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.380 
so here we have about a hundred percent
and<00:03:29.560> somewhere<00:03:30.560> around<00:03:30.709> through<00:03:31.400> here<00:03:31.459> would

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
and somewhere around through here would

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.160 
and somewhere around through here would
be<00:03:32.570> about<00:03:32.840> 80%<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.830> that<00:03:33.920> diameter<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.480> we<00:03:35.810> want

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
be about 80% of that diameter so we want

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.890 
be about 80% of that diameter so we want
to<00:03:36.290> make<00:03:36.470> our<00:03:36.709> cut<00:03:37.160> down<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.760> our<00:03:38.390> cut<00:03:38.630> up

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
to make our cut down and our cut up

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.320 
to make our cut down and our cut up
creating<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.680> notch<00:03:39.890> with<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.610> two<00:03:40.850> corners

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
creating that notch with the two corners

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.110 
creating that notch with the two corners
approximately<00:03:42.110> this<00:03:42.260> position<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.310> do<00:03:43.670> our

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
approximately this position a to do our

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.090 
approximately this position a to do our
face<00:03:44.390> notch<00:03:44.690> now<00:03:45.019> we<00:03:45.079> need<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.530> make<00:03:45.680> sure<00:03:45.890> that

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
face notch now we need to make sure that

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.630 
face notch now we need to make sure that
we<00:03:46.220> have<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> cut<00:03:46.730> coming<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.329> from<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> top<00:03:47.750> and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
we have a cut coming in from the top and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.940 
we have a cut coming in from the top and
a<00:03:49.640> cut<00:03:49.970> coming<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.480> from<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.840> bottom<00:03:51.049> to

reactive<00:05:55.030> forces

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.030 

we<00:06:07.610> place<00:06:07.820> the<00:06:07.970> wedge<00:06:08.150> in<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.450> back<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:09.860> hold

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
we place the wedge in the back to hold

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.880 
we place the wedge in the back to hold
the<00:06:10.310> weight<00:06:10.460> of<00:06:10.760> the<00:06:11.030> tree<00:06:11.330> now<00:06:11.540> we<00:06:12.440> have<00:06:12.740> the

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
the weight of the tree now we have the

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.860 
the weight of the tree now we have the
wedge<00:06:13.070> in<00:06:13.370> that<00:06:13.880> will<00:06:14.030> help<00:06:14.120> to<00:06:14.300> support<00:06:14.600> that

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
wedge in that will help to support that

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.870 
wedge in that will help to support that

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.130 

the<00:06:42.490> important<00:06:42.910> part<00:06:43.150> of<00:06:43.240> any<00:06:43.390> plan<00:06:43.720> is<00:06:43.990> to

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
the important part of any plan is to

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.890 
the important part of any plan is to
check<00:06:44.350> out<00:06:44.530> the<00:06:44.680> results<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.310> as<00:06:45.370> you<00:06:45.460> can<00:06:45.610> see

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
check out the results and as you can see

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.810 
check out the results and as you can see
our<00:06:46.900> plan<00:06:47.140> was<00:06:47.380> to<00:06:47.500> put<00:06:47.680> this<00:06:47.860> tree<00:06:48.160> top<00:06:48.400> in<00:06:48.730> the

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
our plan was to put this tree top in the

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.310 
our plan was to put this tree top in the
middle<00:06:49.120> between<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.630> two<00:06:49.660> other<00:06:49.960> trees

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.700 
middle between the two other trees
pretty<00:06:51.040> good<00:06:51.220> shot<00:06:51.480> we<00:06:52.480> utilized<00:06:52.930> our<00:06:53.140> target

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
pretty good shot we utilized our target

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.290 
pretty good shot we utilized our target
and<00:06:53.920> you<00:06:54.010> can<00:06:54.130> see<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.400> offset<00:06:54.850> to<00:06:54.970> be<00:06:55.090> able<00:06:55.240> to

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
and you can see the offset to be able to

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.350 
and you can see the offset to be able to
do<00:06:55.420> that<00:06:55.630> but<00:06:56.110> in<00:06:56.230> real<00:06:56.530> results<00:06:57.520> this<00:06:58.120> is

do that but in real results this is

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.990 
do that but in real results this is

the tree would move about this far the

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.280 
the tree would move about this far the
face<00:07:24.820> notch<00:07:25.060> would<00:07:25.270> close<00:07:25.570> our<00:07:25.870> hinge<00:07:26.110> would

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
face notch would close our hinge would

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.280 
face notch would close our hinge would

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
before our hinge is stressed so it

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.590 
before our hinge is stressed so it
enables<00:07:36.310> work<00:07:36.520> just<00:07:36.730> like<00:07:36.880> the<00:07:37.090> hinge<00:07:37.330> on<00:07:37.540> a

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.070 
reaction time in certain situations so

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.940 
reaction time in certain situations so
make<00:07:57.820> sure<00:07:57.850> that<00:07:58.300> your<00:07:58.479> face<00:07:58.690> notch<00:07:59.020> is<00:07:59.380> open

make sure that your face notch is open

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.740 
make sure that your face notch is open
enough<00:08:00.190> to<00:08:00.220> allow<00:08:00.610> that<00:08:00.880> hinge<00:08:01.150> to<00:08:01.360> work<00:08:01.540> the
