00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
februari 6 which is a very powerful and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.020 
februari 6 which is a very powerful and
widely<00:01:58.740> felt<00:01:58.890> earthquake<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> region

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
widely felt earthquake for the region

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179 
widely felt earthquake for the region
now<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> important<00:02:01.350> aspect<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.979> time

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now the important aspect is this time

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.370 
now the important aspect is this time
round<00:02:02.430> things<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.299> opposite<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.049> actually

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
round things are opposite we actually

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.230 
round things are opposite we actually
have<00:02:04.590> Jupiter<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.340> direct<00:02:05.610> after<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
have Jupiter going direct after the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.089 
have Jupiter going direct after the
retrograde<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.810> Saturn<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
retrograde of Saturn now we have a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.999 
retrograde of Saturn now we have a
shorter<00:02:08.520> time<00:02:08.700> span<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.209> time<00:02:09.420> around<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
shorter time span this time around in

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.040 
shorter time span this time around in
2014<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.280> only<00:02:11.400> four<00:02:11.520> days<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.060> separation

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
2014 with only four days of separation

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.720 
2014 with only four days of separation
but<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:13.320> also<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.590> an<00:02:13.830> extra<00:02:14.280> retrograde

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
but we also have an extra retrograde

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.060 
but we also have an extra retrograde
cycle<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> consider<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.110> Mars<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.040> I

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
cycle to consider and that is Mars so I

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.110 
cycle to consider and that is Mars so I
feel<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.730> very<00:02:18.000> strong

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
feel that there is a very strong

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.390 
feel that there is a very strong
potential<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.840> very<00:02:19.260> large<00:02:19.440> earthquake<00:02:19.890> during

this time frame or the first week of
March<00:02:22.910> when<00:02:23.910> I'm<00:02:24.030> going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.210> look<00:02:24.270> at<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
March when I'm going to look at this a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.880 
March when I'm going to look at this a
little<00:02:24.720> bit<00:02:24.900> more<00:02:25.050> closely<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.590> look<00:02:25.710> at<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
little bit more closely and look at the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
little bit more closely and look at the
past<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.850> only<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.240> have<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> magnitude<00:02:27.870> 8.0

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500

but<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.060> look<00:02:33.240> this<00:02:33.750> occurs<00:02:34.050> roughly

but we have a look this occurs roughly

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410 
but we have a look this occurs roughly
every<00:02:34.680> 20<00:02:35.040> years<00:02:35.070> due<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.700> orbits<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> both

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
important feature in this work and

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.610 
important feature in this work and

at<00:03:46.980> solar<00:03:47.640> watch<00:03:47.850> net<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:50.060> finally<00:03:51.060> taking

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
at solar watch net and finally taking

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.120 
at solar watch net and finally taking
this<00:03:51.480> one<00:03:51.720> step<00:03:51.750> further<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.560> looking<00:03:53.010> more

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
this one step further and looking more

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.130 
this one step further and looking more
closely<00:03:53.310> into<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:53.970> Mars<00:03:54.300> retrograde<00:03:54.450> cycle

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
closely into the Mars retrograde cycle

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.140 
closely into the Mars retrograde cycle
with<00:03:55.380> respect<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.920> Jupiter's<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.520> satins<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
with respect to Jupiter's and satins and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.330 
with respect to Jupiter's and satins and
we<00:03:57.840> do<00:03:57.959> see<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.260> when<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.650> Mars<00:03:59.040> retrograde

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
we do see that when the Mars retrograde

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.000 
we do see that when the Mars retrograde
cycles<00:04:00.060> begins<00:04:00.450> there<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.260> an<00:04:01.410> uptick<00:04:01.830> in

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
cycles begins there is an uptick in

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.040 
cycles begins there is an uptick in
volcanic<00:04:02.520> activations<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
volcanic activations and that is the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.199 
volcanic activations and that is the
important<00:04:04.410> aspect<00:04:04.770> of<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.100> watch<00:04:05.400> there<00:04:06.090> may

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
important aspect of this watch there may

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.000 
important aspect of this watch there may
be<00:04:06.239> strong<00:04:06.660> volcanic<00:04:07.170> activity<00:04:07.650> or

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
be strong volcanic activity or

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.340 
be strong volcanic activity or

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
significant rise in volcanic unrest

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.140 
significant rise in volcanic unrest
during<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.920> first<00:04:11.130> week<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.640> month<00:04:11.850> of

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.690 
March and now for the forecast for this
period<00:04:15.570> I<00:04:15.870> do<00:04:16.080> feel<00:04:16.230> as<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> potential<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.130> a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
period I do feel as a potential and a

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.659 
period I do feel as a potential and a
very<00:04:17.910> high<00:04:18.120> possibility<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.169> 7.2<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.830> 7.5

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
very high possibility of a 7.2 to 7.5

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.640 
very high possibility of a 7.2 to 7.5

latitudes in the southern hemisphere and
that's<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.289> assessment<00:04:25.800> for<00:04:25.979> this

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
that's the assessment for this
