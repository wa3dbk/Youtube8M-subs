ivory because you just have that film on

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
ivory because you just have that film on
your<00:01:28.020> skin<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.920> guess<00:01:29.490> they're<00:01:29.729> telling

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
your skin which I guess they're telling

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.800 
your skin which I guess they're telling
you<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.829> milk<00:01:31.829> or<00:01:32.159> whatever<00:01:32.460> type<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> moisture

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you is milk or whatever type of moisture

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
you is milk or whatever type of moisture
they<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.290> there<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.920> doesn't

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
they have in there but it just doesn't

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.760 
they have in there but it just doesn't
feel<00:01:35.369> clean<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.290> referred

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
feel clean so I think I just referred

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
feel clean so I think I just referred
out<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.790> skin<00:01:39.090> feels<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
out because my skin feels more like

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.190 
out because my skin feels more like
stripped<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.939> clean<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.240> anyways<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
stripped down clean but anyways that's a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.690 
stripped down clean but anyways that's a
whole<00:01:43.380> nother<00:01:43.740> story<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.850> um<00:01:46.220> yeah<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.549> for

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
whole nother story but um yeah so for

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.429 
whole nother story but um yeah so for
the<00:01:47.790> longest<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.590> using<00:01:50.899> purity<00:01:51.899> by

the longest time I was using purity by

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.209 
the longest time I was using purity by
philosophy<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:54.030> clean<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.840> skin<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.500> it's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
philosophy to clean my skin because it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.700 
philosophy to clean my skin because it's
supposed<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.149> gentle<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> face

does and I probably used it for have a
piece<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> hair<00:02:08.330> okay<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.619> were<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
piece of hair okay I know you were a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.290 
piece of hair okay I know you were a
little<00:02:10.979> girls<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.580> then<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.760> get<00:02:11.879> stuck<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
little girls and then you get stuck to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.210 
little girls and then you get stuck to
your<00:02:12.450> lips<00:02:12.599> but

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
your lips but

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.440 
your lips but
just<00:02:13.550> thinking<00:02:13.730> about<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.970> between<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.360> can

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
just thinking about that between you can

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.620 
just thinking about that between you can
say<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.200> I'm<00:02:15.470> not<00:02:15.620> an<00:02:15.770> opinion<00:02:16.010> or

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
say it because I'm not an opinion or

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.540 
say it because I'm not an opinion or
rerecord<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.710> this<00:02:19.070> does<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:19.490> all

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
rerecord in this but this does get all

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.460 
rerecord in this but this does get all
of<00:02:19.700> your<00:02:19.820> makeup<00:02:19.970> off<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.660> has<00:02:20.930> never<00:02:21.140> caused

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
of your makeup off it has never caused

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.990 
of your makeup off it has never caused
me<00:02:21.590> any<00:02:21.770> problems<00:02:21.980> doesn't<00:02:22.640> make<00:02:22.730> me<00:02:22.820> break

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
me any problems doesn't make me break

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.230 
me any problems doesn't make me break
out<00:02:23.090> at<00:02:23.240> all<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:25.160> think<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:26.000> does

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
out at all but it's I think this does

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.960 
out at all but it's I think this does
this<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.380> 30<00:02:27.800> ounce<00:02:27.980> bottle<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.760> think

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
this is a 30 ounce bottle and I think

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.930 
this is a 30 ounce bottle and I think
this<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.210> like<00:02:29.330> $40<00:02:30.200> from<00:02:30.920> Sephora<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:31.700> it's

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
this is like $40 from Sephora if it's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.360 
this is like $40 from Sephora if it's
not<00:02:32.090> 48<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:32.720> pretty<00:02:32.900> close<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.260> 48<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.250> I've

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
not 48 it's pretty close to 48 but I've

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.040 
not 48 it's pretty close to 48 but I've
been<00:02:34.580> using<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.940> for<00:02:35.150> years<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.930> can

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
been using this for years and as you can

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.720 
been using this for years and as you can
see<00:02:36.110> I'm<00:02:36.320> almost<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.890> only<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> little<00:02:37.640> bit

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
see I'm almost I only have a little bit

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.140 
see I'm almost I only have a little bit

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
left

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.600 
left
and<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.810> normally<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.830> know<00:02:39.980> reorder

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
and I normally just you know reorder

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.880 
and I normally just you know reorder
right<00:02:41.330> before<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.660> run<00:02:41.870> out<00:02:41.900> but<00:02:42.440> I've<00:02:42.650> been

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
right before I run out but I've been

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.790 
right before I run out but I've been
hearing<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.460> lot<00:02:43.490> of<00:02:43.670> people<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.240> YouTube<00:02:44.800> talk

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
hearing a lot of people on YouTube talk

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.670 
hearing a lot of people on YouTube talk
about<00:02:46.190> Cetaphil<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.240> how<00:02:47.630> good<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.900> was<00:02:48.290> for

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
about Cetaphil and how good it was for

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.300 
about Cetaphil and how good it was for
very<00:02:49.610> sensitive<00:02:50.090> skin<00:02:50.770> but<00:02:51.770> this<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.190> know

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
very sensitive skin but this you know

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
very sensitive skin but this you know
you<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.580> get<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.850> at<00:02:53.180> any<00:02:53.510> drugstore<00:02:53.959> pretty

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
you can get it at any drugstore pretty

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.390 
you can get it at any drugstore pretty
much<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:56.150> 16<00:02:56.630> ounce<00:02:56.810> bottle<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.560> this

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
much this is a 16 ounce bottle and this

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.060 
much this is a 16 ounce bottle and this
was<00:02:58.670> about<00:02:59.360> $10<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.080> think<00:03:00.350> which<00:03:00.650> obviously

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
was about $10 I think which obviously

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.440 
was about $10 I think which obviously
the<00:03:01.280> price<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.610> going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.850> vary<00:03:02.030> depending<00:03:02.209> on

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the price is going to vary depending on

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.070 
the price is going to vary depending on
what<00:03:02.600> drug<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.080> get<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.290> from<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:05.750> is

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
what drug so you get it from so this is

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.040 
what drug so you get it from so this is
you<00:03:06.530> know<00:03:06.650> half<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.220> amount<00:03:07.430> as<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:08.630> bottle

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
you know half the amount as this bottle

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.020 
you know half the amount as this bottle
but<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.800> know<00:03:09.920> almost<00:03:10.160> 15<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:10.880> this

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
but this is you know almost 15 and this

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.480 
but this is you know almost 15 and this
was<00:03:11.209> ten<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.200> obviously<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.740> sorta<00:03:13.010> feel<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.459> a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
was ten so obviously I sorta feel is a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.120 
was ten so obviously I sorta feel is a
lot<00:03:13.730> cheaper<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.260> was<00:03:15.620> worried<00:03:16.010> about

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
lot cheaper but I was worried about

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.229 
lot cheaper but I was worried about
using<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.850> because<00:03:16.970> um<00:03:18.340> one<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:19.940> get<00:03:20.120> it

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
using it because um one you can get it

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.360 
using it because um one you can get it
from<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.600> drugstore<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.800> don't<00:03:22.100> have

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
from the drugstore and I just don't have

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.180 
from the drugstore and I just don't have
a<00:03:22.820> whole<00:03:23.209> lot<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.690> faith<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.260> anything<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:24.980> I

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
a whole lot of faith and anything that I

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.550 
a whole lot of faith and anything that I
can<00:03:25.400> get<00:03:25.489> from<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.760> drugstore<00:03:26.230> if<00:03:27.230> it's<00:03:27.410> not

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
can get from the drugstore if it's not

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.979 
can get from the drugstore if it's not
you<00:03:28.190> know<00:03:28.310> at<00:03:28.489> least<00:03:28.700> somewhat<00:03:29.390> difficult<00:03:29.600> to

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
you know at least somewhat difficult to

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.370 
you know at least somewhat difficult to
come<00:03:30.170> by<00:03:31.570> assume<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:32.780> not<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.110> work<00:03:33.230> as

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
to have been working so well for me I

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.920 
to have been working so well for me I
didn't<00:03:40.970> want<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.180> switch<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.510> try<00:03:41.570> anything

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
didn't want to switch and try anything

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.420 
didn't want to switch and try anything
else<00:03:42.140> because<00:03:42.380> once<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.890> found<00:03:43.070> something<00:03:43.340> I

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
else because once I found something I

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.729 
else because once I found something I
liked<00:03:43.730> or<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.630> works<00:03:44.810> for<00:03:44.989> me<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.380> pretty<00:03:45.560> much

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
liked or that works for me I pretty much

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.530 
liked or that works for me I pretty much
stick<00:03:46.010> with<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.400> unless<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.790> have<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> reason<00:03:47.299> to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
stick with it unless I have a reason to

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.140 
stick with it unless I have a reason to
switch<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:48.860> since<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.430> many<00:03:49.640> people<00:03:50.000> on

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
switch but since so many people on

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.580 
switch but since so many people on
YouTube<00:03:50.510> talked<00:03:50.750> about<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.170> figured<00:03:51.530> I

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
YouTube talked about it I figured I

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.699 
YouTube talked about it I figured I
would<00:03:51.739> try<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.250> not<00:03:52.810> reorder<00:03:53.810> my<00:03:54.110> purity

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
would try it and not reorder my purity

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.009 
would try it and not reorder my purity
like<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.040> normally<00:03:55.160> do<00:03:55.489> so<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:56.239> try<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.510> and

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
like I normally do so I try this and

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.600 
like I normally do so I try this and
this<00:03:57.680> works<00:03:57.920> just<00:03:58.400> as<00:03:58.580> well<00:03:58.760> as<00:03:59.060> purity<00:03:59.540> I<00:04:00.610> will

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
this works just as well as purity I will

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.940 
this works just as well as purity I will
not<00:04:01.820> be<00:04:02.180> repurchasing<00:04:02.989> period<00:04:03.320> in<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.590> future

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
not be repurchasing period in the future

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.060 
not be repurchasing period in the future

Cetaphil gets my makeup off just as well
as<00:04:07.400> purity<00:04:08.269> I'm<00:04:08.510> not<00:04:09.140> what<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.350> normally<00:04:09.470> do<00:04:10.010> is

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
as purity I'm not what I normally do is

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.670 
as purity I'm not what I normally do is
I<00:04:10.459> use<00:04:10.700> on<00:04:10.910> like<00:04:11.810> one<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.110> those<00:04:12.200> pre-moistened

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
I use on like one of those pre-moistened

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.810 
I use on like one of those pre-moistened
wipes<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.549> get<00:04:13.790> my<00:04:14.360> makeup<00:04:14.720> off<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:14.930> then<00:04:15.410> as

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
wipes to get my makeup off and then as

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.340 
wipes to get my makeup off and then as
much<00:04:16.820> as<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.150> can<00:04:17.209> get<00:04:17.450> off<00:04:17.570> with<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.900> wipe<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.290> do

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
much as I can get off with the wipe I do

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.400 
much as I can get off with the wipe I do
that<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.919> then<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.640> wash<00:04:19.880> my<00:04:20.090> face<00:04:20.260> with<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
that and then I wash my face with the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.250 
that and then I wash my face with the
facial<00:04:21.620> wash<00:04:21.979> as<00:04:22.970> far<00:04:23.300> as<00:04:23.390> comparing<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.020> two

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
facial wash as far as comparing the two

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.070 
facial wash as far as comparing the two
I<00:04:24.729> would<00:04:25.729> say<00:04:25.789> they<00:04:26.030> both<00:04:26.300> do<00:04:26.599> exact

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
I would say they both do exact

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.379 
I would say they both do exact
the<00:04:27.169> same<00:04:27.379> thing<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:27.949> really<00:04:28.099> the<00:04:28.940> price<00:04:29.180> is

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
the same thing so really the price is

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.640 
the same thing so really the price is
the<00:04:29.539> main<00:04:29.720> difference<00:04:29.960> both<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.860> them<00:04:31.039> have

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
the main difference both of them have

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.619 
the main difference both of them have
like<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:34.599> white<00:04:36.039> creamy<00:04:37.039> type<00:04:37.639> consistency<00:04:38.419> to

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
like a white creamy type consistency to

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.589 
like a white creamy type consistency to
them<00:04:38.949> neither<00:04:39.949> one<00:04:40.520> creates<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.090> whole<00:04:41.270> lot<00:04:41.479> of

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
them neither one creates a whole lot of

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:42.700 
them neither one creates a whole lot of
leather<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.990> have<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.139> little<00:04:42.470> bit<00:04:42.590> more

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
leather you have a little bit more

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.700 
leather you have a little bit more
lather<00:04:42.979> with<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.580> one<00:04:43.870> but<00:04:44.870> don't<00:04:45.139> expect<00:04:45.289> a

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
lather with this one but don't expect a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.260 
lather with this one but don't expect a
whole<00:04:45.860> lot<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:46.250> bubbles<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:48.169> know<00:04:48.289> when<00:04:48.500> you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
whole lot of bubbles you know when you

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.689 
whole lot of bubbles you know when you
apply<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.330> with<00:04:50.690> water<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.919> your<00:04:52.069> face

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
apply it with water to your face

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.200 
apply it with water to your face
so<00:04:53.240> with<00:04:54.110> both<00:04:54.409> I<00:04:54.770> don't<00:04:55.069> feel<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.849> I'm

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
so with both I don't feel like I'm

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.659 
so with both I don't feel like I'm
really<00:04:56.479> cleaning<00:04:56.900> my<00:04:57.020> face<00:04:57.229> at<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.530> time<00:04:57.919> um

really cleaning my face at a time um
even<00:04:59.210> though<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.389> know<00:04:59.599> you<00:04:59.659> rub<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.080> in<00:05:00.199> for<00:05:00.349> a

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
even though you know you rub it in for a

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.320 
even though you know you rub it in for a
few<00:05:00.530> minutes<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:01.039> then<00:05:01.129> rinse<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.490> off<00:05:01.639> it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
few minutes and then rinse it off it

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.730 
few minutes and then rinse it off it
