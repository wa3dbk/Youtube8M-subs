suspects the Camry in the chord and the
fusion<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> they<00:00:38.399> wanted<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> make

this<00:00:39.120> car<00:00:39.420> jump<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> consumers<00:00:41.370> told

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this car jump out now the consumers told

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190 
this car jump out now the consumers told
them<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:42.120> didn't<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> styling

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
them they didn't really like the styling

them they didn't really like the styling
of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> car<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.800> they've<00:00:43.950> updated<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> it's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of the car so they've updated that it's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.979 
of the car so they've updated that it's
a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:44.969> bit<00:00:45.149> longer<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> little<00:00:45.570> wider

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
a little bit longer a little wider

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
a little bit longer a little wider
they've<00:00:46.530> lowered<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> roofline<00:00:47.879> give<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
they've lowered the roofline give it a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.029 
they've lowered the roofline give it a
steeper<00:00:48.780> raked<00:00:49.020> windshield<00:00:49.200> front<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.890> back

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
steeper raked windshield front and back

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
steeper raked windshield front and back
they<00:00:50.370> move<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> a-pillar<00:00:51.239> farther<00:00:51.660> forward

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they move the a-pillar farther forward

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
they move the a-pillar farther forward
that<00:00:52.230> enabled<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> put<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> mirror<00:00:53.520> onto

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that enabled them to put the mirror onto

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
that enabled them to put the mirror onto
the<00:00:54.149> door<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> window<00:00:55.230> made<00:00:55.770> much

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the door and not on the window made much

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.040 
the door and not on the window made much
greater<00:00:56.399> glass<00:00:57.030> area<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.780> outward

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
greater glass area for outward

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.200 
greater glass area for outward
visibility<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> car<00:00:59.460> definitely<00:00:59.730> does

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
visibility so the car definitely does

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
visibility so the car definitely does
pop<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.809> all<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.109> them<00:01:01.260> come<00:01:01.469> standard<00:01:01.859> with

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pop and all of them come standard with

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
pop and all of them come standard with
alloy<00:01:02.370> wheels<00:01:02.699> even<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.239> base<00:01:03.420> model<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.320> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
alloy wheels even the base model so it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
alloy wheels even the base model so it
looks<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.920> dynamic<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.060> sure<00:01:06.270> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
looks more dynamic that's for sure in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.929 
looks more dynamic that's for sure in
addition<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.650> consumers<00:01:08.400> told<00:01:08.640> them<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
addition the consumers told them that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
addition the consumers told them that
they<00:01:09.030> worried<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.479> buying<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.900> all-wheel

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
they worried about buying an all-wheel

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.990 
they worried about buying an all-wheel
drive<00:01:10.409> car<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> fuel<00:01:11.490> consumption

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
drive car because of a fuel consumption

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.260 
drive car because of a fuel consumption
penalty<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.350> Subaru<00:01:13.920> went<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> town<00:01:14.520> improving

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
penalty so Subaru went to town improving

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.420 
penalty so Subaru went to town improving
the<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> car<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.320> made<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.189> way<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the way the car is made and the way it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
the way the car is made and the way it
drives<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.119> produce<00:01:18.299> fuel<00:01:18.810> economy<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
drives to produce fuel economy that is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
drives to produce fuel economy that is
bumped<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.070> over<00:01:20.610> ten<00:01:20.880> percent<00:01:21.299> from<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bumped up over ten percent from the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
bumped up over ten percent from the
previous<00:01:22.020> model<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.799> we're<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.070> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
previous model so we're here in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
previous model so we're here in
Lafayette<00:01:23.369> Indiana<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> test<00:01:24.960> track

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Lafayette Indiana go on the test track

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
Lafayette Indiana go on the test track
behind<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.710> facility<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.310> drive<00:01:26.790> around<00:01:27.119> the

behind the facility and drive around the
rural<00:01:27.540> countryside<00:01:30.170> now<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> mentioned<00:01:31.740> off

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
rural countryside now as I mentioned off

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
rural countryside now as I mentioned off
the<00:01:31.890> beginning<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> updates<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.180> car

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the beginning the updates for this car

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
the beginning the updates for this car
had<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> serve<00:01:33.930> two<00:01:34.380> purposes<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
had to serve two purposes one was to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.600 
had to serve two purposes one was to
make<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.560> recognizable<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.710> also<00:01:38.549> to

take it up a notch though you can get

it really takes off and you can actually

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.009 
it really takes off and you can actually
mimic<00:03:11.859> up<00:03:12.159> to<00:03:12.280> eight<00:03:12.730> different<00:03:13.060> gear<00:03:13.540> ratios
