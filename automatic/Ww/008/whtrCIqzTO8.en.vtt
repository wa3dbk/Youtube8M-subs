00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.280 
apply a bit confused at the man scrum
was<00:05:30.889> pretty<00:05:31.099> good<00:05:31.279> from<00:05:31.430> Somalia

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.600 

featured<00:05:36.290> going<00:05:36.500> backwards<00:05:37.010> and<00:05:37.160> I<00:05:37.250> think<00:05:37.490> the

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
featured going backwards and I think the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.250 
featured going backwards and I think the
walls<00:05:37.820> come<00:05:39.490> their<00:05:40.490> favor<00:05:40.730> and<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.210> as<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.389> try

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
walls come their favor and so as a try

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.810 
walls come their favor and so as a try
you<00:05:42.560> see<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:42.889> here<00:05:44.410> taking<00:05:45.410> chances<00:05:45.650> head<00:05:45.980> and

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
you see it here taking chances head and

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.000 
you see it here taking chances head and
probably<00:05:47.570> my<00:05:47.660> getting<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:48.080> was<00:05:48.350> if<00:05:48.530> I<00:05:48.710> was<00:05:48.740> the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
probably my getting it was if I was the

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:55.210 
probably my getting it was if I was the
bait<00:05:49.190> in<00:05:49.340> his<00:05:49.460> career<00:05:51.520> tired<00:05:52.520> defeats<00:05:54.220> step

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
bait in his career tired defeats step

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.230

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
through these kicked as a cool one

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.920 
through these kicked as a cool one
skewed<00:06:00.139> and<00:06:00.380> Crossfield<00:06:01.180> now<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:02.419> now<00:06:02.569> had

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
skewed and Crossfield now so now had

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.430 
skewed and Crossfield now so now had
some<00:06:03.500> counter-attacking<00:06:04.220> ability<00:06:05.289> to<00:06:06.289> go

down the way defense woke me up to it I

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.260 
down the way defense woke me up to it I
think<00:06:10.009> the<00:06:10.069> trials<00:06:10.490> can<00:06:10.699> be<00:06:10.759> given<00:06:11.240> here
