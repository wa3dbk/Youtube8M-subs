00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.279 
know they have future pairs coming out
it's<00:02:05.609> probably<00:02:06.060> too<00:02:06.240> late<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.719> address<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> on

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
it's probably too late to address it on

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's probably too late to address it on
those<00:02:07.530> pairs<00:02:07.910> because<00:02:08.910> uh<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.259> they're

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
