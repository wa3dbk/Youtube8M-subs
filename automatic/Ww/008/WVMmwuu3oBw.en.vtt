00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
the concept of the flow now it's a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.670 
the concept of the flow now it's a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
we're trying to cover five levels and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
we're trying to cover five levels and
things<00:00:10.200> are<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.620> feel<00:00:10.800> different

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
make sure that leveling up through the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.540 
make sure that leveling up through the
classic<00:00:15.929> zones<00:00:16.139> felt<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> new<00:00:16.980> experience

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
classic zones felt like a new experience

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.490 
classic zones felt like a new experience
and<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.880> really<00:00:18.090> fit<00:00:18.420> with<00:00:18.930> what's<00:00:19.170> happening

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500

that due to everyone not only in just
the<00:00:26.820> quest<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> way<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> zones<00:00:28.080> look

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the quest but in the way the zones look

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.999 
the quest but in the way the zones look
and<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.619> feel<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.439> we're<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:31.890> into

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and they feel so we're going to go into

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.620 
and they feel so we're going to go into
a<00:00:32.099> few<00:00:32.309> details<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> some<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> actual

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
a few details now in some of the actual

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.250 
a few details now in some of the actual
zones<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.230> start<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> Barons<00:00:36.260> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
zones will start with the Barons so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
zones will start with the Barons so
here's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> look<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> Barons<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> exists

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
here's a look at the Barons as it exists

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.260 
here's a look at the Barons as it exists
right<00:00:38.940> now<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:40.430> then<00:00:41.430> here's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> shot<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
right now and then here's a shot of it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.340 
right now and then here's a shot of it
after<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.860> cataclysm<00:00:43.860> attack<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> basically

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
after a cataclysm attack so basically

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.620 
after a cataclysm attack so basically
it's<00:00:46.500> split<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> Barons<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.550> half

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.260 

there's<00:00:52.260> another<00:00:52.440> view<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:52.920> south<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
there's another view to the south and I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.370 
there's another view to the south and I
think<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.540> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.810> might<00:00:54.900> remember<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
think a lot of you might remember a

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.680 
think a lot of you might remember a
character<00:00:55.890> called<00:00:56.160> nah<00:00:56.430> relax<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.150> wailing

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
character called nah relax from wailing

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
character called nah relax from wailing
caverns<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.770> his<00:00:58.860> goals<00:00:59.040> he<00:00:59.310> was<00:00:59.430> trying

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
caverns one of his goals he was trying

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.030 
caverns one of his goals he was trying
to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.150> actually<00:01:00.360> trying<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.140> regrow<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
to do is actually trying to regrow the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.620 
to do is actually trying to regrow the
Barons<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.060> looks<00:01:03.240> like<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.450> might<00:01:03.600> have

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
Barons well it looks like you might have

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.650 
Barons well it looks like you might have
been<00:01:03.780> successful<00:01:04.320> finally<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> always

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
been successful finally and you always

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.850 
been successful finally and you always
thought<00:01:06.930> he<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.200> trying<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
thought he was just trying to get you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
thought he was just trying to get you
lost<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.370> wailing<00:01:08.670> caverns<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.230> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
lost and wailing caverns the actually I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
lost and wailing caverns the actually I
plan<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.280> could<00:01:11.430> ever<00:01:11.580> find<00:01:11.790> his<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.180> out

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
plan if you could ever find his way out

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
plan if you could ever find his way out
he<00:01:12.930> might<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.260> able<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> desolace

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
he might be able to do this so desolace

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.040 
he might be able to do this so desolace
has<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> couple<00:01:18.060> looks<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.330> desolace<00:01:18.660> so

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
has a couple looks at desolace so

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.900 
has a couple looks at desolace so
desolace<00:01:19.410> is<00:01:19.530> always<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.800> dark<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> dreary

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
desolace is always a dark kind of dreary

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.930 
desolace is always a dark kind of dreary
zone<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:22.410> cataclysm<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.520> cracked

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
zone the cataclysm is actually cracked

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.850 
zone the cataclysm is actually cracked
open<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.300> shore<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.140> lot<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> water<00:01:25.560> into

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
open the shore and a lot of water into

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
open the shore and a lot of water into
the<00:01:26.070> zone<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.460> new<00:01:26.610> ways<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> allowed<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the zone in new ways which is allowed it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.340 
the zone in new ways which is allowed it
to<00:01:27.960> regrow<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> you're<00:01:30.690> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:31.020> really

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
to regrow so you're going to see really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.780 
to regrow so you're going to see really
big<00:01:31.530> changes<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.310> zones<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.729> are

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
big changes in these zones that are

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.160 
big changes in these zones that are
really<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.300> affect<00:01:33.360> things<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
really going to affect things that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
really going to affect things that
you've<00:01:34.290> never<00:01:34.410> never<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> been<00:01:35.550> there

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you've never never kind of been there

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
you've never never kind of been there
and<00:01:35.850> never<00:01:35.970> had<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.300> experience<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and never had that experience in this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.390 
and never had that experience in this
place<00:01:37.229> before<00:01:39.800> now<00:01:40.800> another<00:01:41.009> thing<00:01:41.100> we're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
place before now another thing we're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
place before now another thing we're
doing<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.940> Cataclysm<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.509> actually

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
doing this the Cataclysm is actually

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.210 
doing this the Cataclysm is actually
bringing<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.229> new<00:01:43.410> pieces<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.830> land<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bringing up new pieces of land that
