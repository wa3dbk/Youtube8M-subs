00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:25.283
The First Christmas

00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:28.033
Retold by Eliane Pinheiro

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:36.867
and Maura Hurley

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.367
Around the month of December,

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:42.950
children like to imagine

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.367
what happened on the very first Christmas ever,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.950
what happened on the very first Christmas ever,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.533
even before Santa Claus.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.117
I know the story well,

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:58.200
for I was watching it all from above –

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
for I was watching it all from above –

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.700
in the dark sky

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.033
on the evening of December 24th, oh so many years ago.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:14.617
I am the Star of Bethlehem.

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:18.117
I was requested by angels

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:18.867
to shine brighter than all the other stars that night,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:24.867
to shine brighter than all the other stars that night,

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.533
to tell the whole world

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.283
that a very special child

00:01:29.283 --> 00:01:31.700
had been born

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.450
to spread goodwill and peace.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:47.117
And this is the story of the first Christmas.

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:50.283
All was quiet that night

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:51.950
as I watched

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.450
the Three Kings traveling slowly on camel back

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.367
through desert lands.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.283
Just then, I beamed brightly,

00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:03.617
as the angels had told me to.

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:07.533
The Kings noticed me in the East.

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.117
They couldn’t resist my brilliance.

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:11.367
They couldn’t resist my brilliance.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:13.450
Perhaps they had heard

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.867
that a star like me was going to

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:21.117
show the way to the son of God.

00:02:21.117 --> 00:02:23.867
Traveling through the night,

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.450
the Kings met shepherds

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.117
watching over their flock.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.450
We are following

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.033
that incredibly beautiful star there in the East,

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.033
that incredibly beautiful star there in the East,

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.283
to find the place

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:44.450
where the son of God has just been born.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.450
From there

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.283
they all traveled together,

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:49.950
watching me, the brightest star in the sky.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.867
watching me, the brightest star in the sky.

00:02:56.867 --> 00:03:01.450
Finally, they arrived at a small town

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.283
called Bethlehem,

00:03:05.283 --> 00:03:08.617
and saw that I was gleaming

00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:14.033
radiantly above the barnyard

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:19.617
All was quiet and peaceful.

00:03:19.617 --> 00:03:23.783
Their caravan entered the barnyard

00:03:23.783 --> 00:03:27.117
to see the tender little baby

00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:28.617
fluffed with hay.

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:33.200
fluffed with hay.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.950
Next to the baby

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.200
were Mary and Joseph,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.200
his mother and father, and many farm animals.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.617
The Kings offered the precious gifts

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:51.283
they’d carried from afar

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:53.783
for baby Jesus:

00:03:53.783 --> 00:04:01.867
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.283
The shepherds kneeled on the ground to pray;

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:06.950
The shepherds kneeled on the ground to pray;

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.450
they were grateful for the gift of love and the purity

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.950
they were grateful for the gift of love and the purity

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.617
the baby brought.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.117
the baby brought.

00:04:14.117 --> 00:04:15.700
Many people offered gifts after that –

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.783
Many people offered gifts after that -

00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:22.700
I suppose this is why

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.533
on Christmas Day,

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.283
people around the world

00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:27.700
enjoy offering gifts as a sign of love and hope.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.200
enjoy offering gifts as a sign of love and hope.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.533
And they try their best

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:37.617
to bring happiness to others,

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:44.033
as Jesus did all his life.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.117
Now I’d like to wish you

00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:49.617
a holiday season that shines as brightly

00:04:49.617 --> 00:04:53.283
as the Star of Bethlehem!
