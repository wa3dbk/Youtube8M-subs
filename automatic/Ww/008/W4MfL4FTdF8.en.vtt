00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
them for both sides of the trip so that

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.870 
them for both sides of the trip so that
way<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:33.740> kind<00:04:33.920> of<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.070> surprise<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.640> holds

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
way it's kind of a surprise it holds

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.130 
way it's kind of a surprise it holds
their<00:04:35.000> attention<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.420> that<00:04:35.540> sort<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.780> thing

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
their attention to that sort of thing

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.630 
their attention to that sort of thing
and<00:04:36.260> that's<00:04:36.590> worked<00:04:36.830> really<00:04:37.040> well<00:04:37.160> as<00:04:37.400> far<00:04:37.610> as

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
and that's worked really well as far as

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.320 
and that's worked really well as far as
entertainment<00:04:38.770> we<00:04:39.770> did<00:04:40.100> opt<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.940> bring<00:04:41.210> our

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
entertainment we did opt to bring our

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.840 
entertainment we did opt to bring our
own<00:04:41.480> car<00:04:41.720> seats<00:04:41.990> with<00:04:42.200> us<00:04:42.380> instead<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.220> trying

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
own car seats with us instead of trying

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.490 
own car seats with us instead of trying
to<00:04:44.030> figure<00:04:44.330> out<00:04:44.390> car<00:04:44.630> seats<00:04:44.870> on<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.020> end<00:04:45.380> we

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
to figure out car seats on that end we

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.050 
to figure out car seats on that end we
do<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.650> rental<00:04:46.040> car<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.340> all<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.610> so

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
do a rental car and all that so

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.580 
do a rental car and all that so
something<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.450> think<00:04:47.600> of<00:04:47.780> if<00:04:48.020> you're<00:04:48.170> going<00:04:48.380> to

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
that were used to and then you know then

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.950

you'll<00:05:01.910> have<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.120> rip<00:05:02.300> anything<00:05:02.630> on<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.840> it

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.480 
you'll have to rip anything on that it
as<00:05:03.080> well<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.770> if<00:05:04.130> you're<00:05:04.280> using

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
as well and if you're using

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.010 
as well and if you're using
transportation<00:05:05.270> like<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.510> shuttles<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:05.960> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
transportation like the shuttles and the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.450 
transportation like the shuttles and the
buses<00:05:06.410> then<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.770> would<00:05:06.980> be<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.100> little<00:05:07.370> bit

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
buses then that would be a little bit

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.490 
buses then that would be a little bit
different<00:05:07.850> but<00:05:07.940> we<00:05:08.120> do<00:05:08.660> stay<00:05:08.840> off<00:05:08.960> property<00:05:09.320> at

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
slightly different for us so then as far

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.330 
slightly different for us so then as far
as<00:05:15.050> packing<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.770> know<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.950> have<00:05:16.130> all<00:05:16.220> the

smaller Airport
the<00:06:24.819> other<00:06:24.939> thing<00:06:25.150> I<00:06:25.240> would<00:06:25.330> say<00:06:25.389> going<00:06:25.779> to

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
the road from oh I a from the regular

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:39.779 
the road from oh I a from the regular
Orlando<00:06:37.360> International<00:06:37.509> Airport<00:06:38.520> it<00:06:39.520> was

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
Orlando International Airport it was

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.850 
Orlando International Airport it was
wonderful<00:06:40.419> I<00:06:40.479> mean<00:06:40.659> it's<00:06:40.809> a<00:06:40.930> small<00:06:41.199> airport<00:06:41.650> it

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
wonderful I mean it's a small airport it

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.409 
wonderful I mean it's a small airport it
was<00:06:41.949> so<00:06:42.129> easy<00:06:42.339> to<00:06:42.460> move<00:06:42.639> around<00:06:42.789> you<00:06:43.180> didn't

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
was so easy to move around you didn't

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.299 
was so easy to move around you didn't
have<00:06:43.509> to<00:06:43.659> hike<00:06:44.199> across<00:06:44.379> these<00:06:44.770> huge<00:06:45.099> long

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:45.309 
have to hike across these huge long

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.399 
have to hike across these huge long
terminals<00:06:45.789> it<00:06:46.150> worked<00:06:46.449> really<00:06:46.960> great<00:06:47.199> with

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409 
terminals it worked really great with

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:48.749 
terminals it worked really great with
pre<00:06:47.559> scroller<00:06:47.889> so<00:06:48.099> I'd<00:06:48.189> say<00:06:48.370> if<00:06:48.430> that's<00:06:48.610> an

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
pre scroller so I'd say if that's an

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.179 
pre scroller so I'd say if that's an
option<00:06:48.879> you<00:06:49.360> may<00:06:49.569> consider<00:06:50.349> that<00:06:50.589> it's

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:51.189 
option you may consider that it's

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:52.290 
option you may consider that it's
something<00:06:51.460> that<00:06:51.550> worked<00:06:51.699> out<00:06:51.849> great<00:06:51.999> for<00:06:52.120> us

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
something that worked out great for us

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.420 
something that worked out great for us
and<00:06:52.659> we<00:06:52.809> will<00:06:52.960> continue<00:06:53.139> to<00:06:53.439> do<00:06:53.559> it<00:06:53.680> for<00:06:53.979> the

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430
