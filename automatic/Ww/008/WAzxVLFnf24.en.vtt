00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello in this video I want you 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.639
 show how to make tealight holder made of concrete 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:16.770
 itself produces the following 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:23.119
 material needs two equal size 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:32.779
 Milk cartons one piece styrodur plate 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:32.779
 this is 50 meters thick a cutter knife 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:47.750
 a pen two day glasses tool 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.750
 to condense the concrete 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350
 water 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.540
 and concrete as concrete I use finished 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.780
 It's the same in any hardware store 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.000
 buy there first would be the garbage 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 chairs with the hangover on the appropriate 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 size cut 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.240
 important is that the bottom of the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.240
 mint is removed 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.200
 I like the same with the second one 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.300
 stage where I make sure that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.300
 a different size cutting edge 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:43.709
 next i draw the outline of the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:45.209
 Milk bag on the styrodur plate this 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:55.140
 is placed at the second 0 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:56.670
 then repeat who the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.130
 marked line with the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.130
 cutter knife cut out 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.230
 this work can also be done with a 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.230
 jigsaw 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.330
 Now I put both milk bags in the 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.330
 prefabricated styrodur plate 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.830
 the styrodur plate gives the chairs 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.660
 the necessary stability that is needed 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:06.720
 if the concrete is filled so the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.330
 Concrete is already in the bucket is now 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.330
 mix the whole with enough water 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.300
 the whole thing is mixed as long as that is 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:43.760
 achieved a nice free consistency 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:43.760
 so shall the consistency with which we are 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.770
 Now the molds with concrete 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.770
 filled 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.110
 between filling it is important the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:28.139
 condense concrete 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:29.970
 I like this with the holzstab so now 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.500
 Both forms are different 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.440
 height filled now become the tea table 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.120
 glasses in the middle of the molds or in the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.120
 concrete pressed 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:51.230
 The glasses are still handed over 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.230
 about one centimeter from the concrete 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.230
 protrude 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:05.400
 so now both glasses are in the concrete 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:07.290
 pressed in with the glasses 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.520
 Drying process does not go up 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:22.560
 they will be wandered 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:29.880
 Write complains the whole thing has to be 48 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:32.010
 hours of drying after 48 hours is the 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:38.040
 Concrete so far hardened that he continues 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:39.990
 Can be processed around the candles 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:52.740
 to get children out of shape cutting edge 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:54.450
 I have a side of garbage chairs on both 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.220
 candlesticks are now out of theirs 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.610
 shapes free and can continue 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.470
 are processed 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:07.530
 I use for further processing 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:09.930
 sandpaper in different ways 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.310
 you can sting the edges and 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.310
 compensate for unevenness 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.210
 the processing with the sandpaper 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.610
 It's a dusty affair, therefore 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.080
 after processing the candlesticks 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:38.940
 Rinse briefly under water 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.740
 so now the candles in and 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.040
 made the terraces lights for the 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.040
 summer 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:59.780
 These two candlesticks are still going 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:04.310
 with deco ribbon and decoration material 

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:07.449
 I will choose you on the result 

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.449
 present immediately 

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:14.210
 and here I present the final result 

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:16.840
 you should have liked my video 

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.840
 thumbs up
