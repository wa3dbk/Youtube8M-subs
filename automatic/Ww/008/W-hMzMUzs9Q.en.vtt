now small digital amps were once the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
now small digital amps were once the
laughing<00:00:54.600> stock<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.350> amplifier<00:00:55.739> industry

laughing stock of the amplifier industry

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
laughing stock of the amplifier industry
after<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.300> could<00:00:57.510> such<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> small<00:00:58.079> amp

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
after all how could such a small amp

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.920 
after all how could such a small amp
chassis<00:00:58.770> produce<00:00:59.129> such<00:00:59.370> big<00:00:59.579> power<00:00:59.809> amps<00:01:00.809> had

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
chassis produce such big power amps had

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.869 
chassis produce such big power amps had
to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.140> big<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.800> aggressive<00:01:02.250> heat<00:01:02.430> sinks<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to be big have aggressive heat sinks and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
to be big have aggressive heat sinks and
run<00:01:03.120> hot<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.629> order<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.229> lots<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.739> sound

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
run hot in order to make lots of sound

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.940 
run hot in order to make lots of sound
or<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.580> most<00:01:05.850> thought<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> mid<00:01:07.290> 2000s

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
or so most thought now in the mid 2000s

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.380 
or so most thought now in the mid 2000s
digital<00:01:08.369> amps<00:01:08.580> came<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:08.909> their<00:01:09.090> own<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
digital amps came into their own and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
digital amps came into their own and
Alpine<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> forefront<00:01:10.860> of

shutting off it just rolls back the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.110 
shutting off it just rolls back the
