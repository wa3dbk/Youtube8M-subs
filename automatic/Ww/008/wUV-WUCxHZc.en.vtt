 hello such a welcome to the blue blog 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
 today I bring you a mini album 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.019
 of girl 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.019
 I hope you like it 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.470
 Look, I show you an album that is made 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.890
 with the same structure as the mini 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.349
 child album 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.560
 as the photomontage was a bit of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.119
 that way then I show you this 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.340
 the structure is the same this is a 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.410
 bit bigger but good so that 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 see the effect that remains in the end I 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.240
 I think it can serve you 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.740
 is unfinished because in this 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.480
 pocket for example I would miss a 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:46.680
 but it serves little card which 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 it unfolds to the left and it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 unfold this album to the right 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.449
 I really like doing it to put pictures of 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.720
 children of babies because you can go putting 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 photos month by month and see how they grow 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.860
 you have it all in one swipe of sight like 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.970
 you see here there is another pocket 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 it also unfolds towards 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.250
 left and it unfolds towards the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.890
 right you see here we can put a month 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.369
 two three four and at a glance 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.369
 you see the evolution in four months 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.000
 here is also a pocket 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.310
 and this is the last page that opens 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.290
 upside down 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.120
 unfolds unfolds and unfolds 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 Well, this is what I wanted 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.980
 show you that in the photomontage already 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.400
 I say it did not look very good and I knew 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.830
 bad that you would not have expected it 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.470
 have already liked to see if you like this way 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.470
 if you do it, it 's like chao chao
