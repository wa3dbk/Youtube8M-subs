where<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.130> given<00:01:20.549> an<00:01:20.820> attack<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.950> nobody

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
where you're given an attack and nobody

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.690 
where you're given an attack and nobody
comes<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:26.010> like<00:01:26.670> it's

always the last note of a piece that's a
piano<00:01:29.010> solo<00:01:29.250> entrance<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> it'll<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.270> like

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I don't I have no idea I still have no

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.709 
I don't I have no idea I still have no
idea<00:01:45.600> how<00:01:46.399> we<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> come<00:01:48.359> in<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
idea how we all know when to come in and

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.709 
idea how we all know when to come in and
it's<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:50.750> there<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:53.479> formula<00:01:54.479> where

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
it's not here there is a formula where

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.349 
it's not here there is a formula where
the<00:01:55.320> top<00:01:55.560> voice<00:01:55.799> leads<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> articulation<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
the top voice leads the articulation so

if there's an oboe playing with us we we

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.749 
if there's an oboe playing with us we we
let<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.420> lead<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.689> articulation<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.859> if<00:02:02.520> for

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
like how do you know where to put it and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.160 
like how do you know where to put it and
I<00:02:19.350> said<00:02:19.560> well<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.330> moment<00:02:21.600> right<00:02:22.140> before

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
I said well it's the moment right before

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I said well it's the moment right before
-<00:02:22.950> wait<00:02:23.130> another<00:02:23.490> moment<00:02:23.790> would<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.180> absurd

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.990 

there's<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.670> resonance<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:33.430> play<00:02:33.970> with

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
there's a resonance that we play with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.970 
there's a resonance that we play with
and<00:02:34.540> when<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.959> say<00:02:35.170> play<00:02:35.379> with<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.590> mean<00:02:35.830> like

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and when I say play with I mean like

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.009 
and when I say play with I mean like
kids<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> sandbox<00:02:36.610> play<00:02:37.120> with<00:02:37.299> okay<00:02:37.780> not

kids in the sandbox play with okay not

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.210 
kids in the sandbox play with okay not
if<00:02:38.230> there's<00:02:38.409> playing<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.860> then<00:02:38.950> there's<00:02:39.099> like

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
that the roasting of the coffee beans is

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.189 
that the roasting of the coffee beans is
a<00:04:47.009> wonderful<00:04:48.110> place<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.159> explore<00:04:51.199> what's

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
a wonderful place to explore what's

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.129 
a wonderful place to explore what's
available<00:04:52.500> from<00:04:53.449> from<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.570> flavor<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:54.990> the

being like I find that for example beans
from<00:04:59.550> Ethiopia<00:05:00.150> are<00:05:00.720> not<00:05:00.930> so<00:05:01.770> well

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
from Ethiopia are not so well

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.020 
from Ethiopia are not so well

if you go with a Vienna roast or even of
a<00:05:09.000> French<00:05:09.270> roast<00:05:09.889> it<00:05:10.889> doesn't<00:05:11.190> really<00:05:11.340> work

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
a French roast it doesn't really work

a French roast it doesn't really work
quite<00:05:11.940> as<00:05:12.090> well<00:05:12.270> as<00:05:12.509> just<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.780> really<00:05:13.050> light

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
quite as well as just a really light

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.620 
quite as well as just a really light
roast<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.979> it's<00:05:14.099> kind<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.610> fun<00:05:15.000> process<00:05:15.509> to

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
roast and it's kind of a fun process to

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.510 
roast and it's kind of a fun process to
watch<00:05:15.780> what<00:05:16.020> happens<00:05:16.169> to<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.680> beans<00:05:16.889> as<00:05:17.250> they

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
watch what happens to the beans as they

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.670 
watch what happens to the beans as they
go<00:05:17.699> through<00:05:17.970> their<00:05:18.120> roasting<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.229> they

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
go through their roasting the they

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.709 
go through their roasting the they
expand<00:05:20.190> they<00:05:20.400> cast<00:05:21.000> off<00:05:21.210> their<00:05:21.389> shell<00:05:21.690> they

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
expand they cast off their shell they

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.480 
expand they cast off their shell they
start<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.229> turn<00:05:22.380> darker<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:22.949> darker<00:05:23.070> Brown

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
start to turn darker and darker Brown

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.459 
start to turn darker and darker Brown
and<00:05:23.520> then<00:05:23.849> they'll<00:05:24.060> get<00:05:24.360> flecks<00:05:24.719> of<00:05:24.930> what

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
and then they'll get flecks of what

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.050 
and then they'll get flecks of what
looks<00:05:25.650> like<00:05:25.710> oily<00:05:26.159> shiny<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.699> then<00:05:26.789> they<00:05:26.909> turn

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
looks like oily shiny and then they turn

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.480 
looks like oily shiny and then they turn
all<00:05:27.300> shiny<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.930> at<00:05:28.440> every<00:05:28.710> stage<00:05:29.039> in<00:05:29.370> that

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
all shiny and at every stage in that

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.540 
all shiny and at every stage in that
they<00:05:29.550> taste<00:05:30.120> different<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.460> think

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
they taste different and and I think

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.450 
they taste different and and I think
that<00:05:32.820> if<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.719> get<00:05:33.960> into<00:05:34.199> coffee<00:05:34.440> roasting<00:05:35.009> one

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
that if you get into coffee roasting one

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.249 
that if you get into coffee roasting one
thing<00:05:35.669> that's<00:05:35.820> really<00:05:36.060> fun<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.539> is<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:37.050> take

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
thing that's really fun to do is to take
