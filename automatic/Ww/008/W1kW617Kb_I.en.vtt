converter what I've got going on here is

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.830 
converter what I've got going on here is
I've<00:00:10.070> left<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.340> guitar<00:00:11.759> controls<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.750> way

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
I've left my guitar controls the way

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.600 
I've left my guitar controls the way
that<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.049> usually<00:00:13.200> set<00:00:13.650> them<00:00:13.769> up<00:00:13.889> volume<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
that I usually set them up volume and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.099 
that I usually set them up volume and
tone<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> way<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.839> everything

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
tone are all the way up on everything

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.109 
tone are all the way up on everything
and<00:00:16.500> I'm<00:00:16.859> using<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.220> combination<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> neck

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and I'm using a combination of the neck

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.170 
and I'm using a combination of the neck
and<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.420> middle<00:00:18.660> pickup<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.789> signals

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and the middle pickup so that signals

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.810 
and the middle pickup so that signals
going<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.680> couple<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> things<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.670> are

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
going out to a couple of things that are

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.210 
going out to a couple of things that are
all<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.269> right<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> frequency

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
all off right now but the frequency

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
all off right now but the frequency
analyzer<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.210> has<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> two<00:00:28.170> outputs

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
analyzer that I have has a two outputs

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.040 
analyzer that I have has a two outputs
on<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.519> I'm<00:00:29.670> splitting<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.779> two

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
on it so I'm splitting that into two

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.580 
on it so I'm splitting that into two
unique<00:00:31.769> channels<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> mixer<00:00:33.469> one<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
unique channels into a mixer one of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.229 
unique channels into a mixer one of
those<00:00:34.710> channels<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.399> rolled<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
those channels that rolled off all the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.560 
those channels that rolled off all the
highs<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> mids<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:39.059> set<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
highs and all the mids and have set that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.560 
highs and all the mids and have set that
to<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.739> low<00:00:40.980> volume<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.850> high<00:00:42.270> level

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to a really low volume but a high level

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.560 
to a really low volume but a high level
of<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> effects<00:00:43.350> send<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.149> trying<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of the effects send so I'm trying to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.610 
of the effects send so I'm trying to
send<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.829> good<00:00:47.610> signal<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> bring<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.110> channel

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
send a good signal to bring that channel

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.729 
send a good signal to bring that channel
to<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.950> sonís<00:00:50.370> which<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.739> Yamaha

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to the sonís which is going into Yamaha

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
to the sonís which is going into Yamaha
tone<00:00:53.039> generator<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.750> that's<00:00:54.930> going

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
tone generator and then that's going

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.069 
tone generator and then that's going
back<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> aux<00:00:56.100> return<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> mixer

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
back into the aux return of the mixer

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.970 
back into the aux return of the mixer
the<00:00:58.079> other<00:00:58.309> channel<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> mixer<00:01:00.530> is<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the other channel of the mixer is just a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.630 
the other channel of the mixer is just a
dry<00:01:02.250> signal<00:01:02.550> I've<00:01:02.879> done<00:01:03.359> noe<00:01:03.570> cueing<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.010> I've

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
dry signal I've done noe cueing and I've

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
dry signal I've done noe cueing and I've
not<00:01:05.939> sent<00:01:06.299> any<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.960> information<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
not sent any of that information to the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640 
not sent any of that information to the
effects<00:01:08.790> loop<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.689> channel

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
effects loop so I have one channel

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
effects loop so I have one channel
basically<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.369> wet<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
basically as wet as I can get it in the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.740 
basically as wet as I can get it in the
effects<00:01:13.110> loop<00:01:13.729> running<00:01:14.729> through<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> MIDI

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
effects loop running through the MIDI

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
effects loop running through the MIDI
converter<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.189> totally<00:01:17.820> dry

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
converter and the other one totally dry

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.109 
converter and the other one totally dry
so<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.200> result<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> you'll<00:01:20.220> hear<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so the result is that you'll hear this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:30.920 
so the result is that you'll hear this
is<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> dry<00:01:21.780> signal<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> turn

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
is just the dry signal so when I turn

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
is just the dry signal so when I turn
the<00:01:31.049> mixer<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> loop<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.340> you'll<00:01:32.700> hear

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the mixer into the loop then you'll hear

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.260 
the mixer into the loop then you'll hear
that<00:01:33.299> signal<00:01:33.869> mixed<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.579> MIDI

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that signal mixed with the MIDI

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.060 
that signal mixed with the MIDI
converter<00:01:36.720> signals<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.380> you'll<00:01:37.650> hear<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
converter signals so you'll hear the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
converter signals so you'll hear the
attack<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> guitar<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.930> you'll<00:01:40.049> be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
attack of the guitar and then you'll be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.240 
attack of the guitar and then you'll be
able<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.530> judge<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.100> latency<00:01:42.350> by<00:01:43.350> hearing<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
able to judge the latency by hearing the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
able to judge the latency by hearing the
attack<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.820> guitar<00:01:45.149> versus<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> attack

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
attack of the guitar versus the attack

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.690 
attack of the guitar versus the attack
of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.890> mini<00:01:47.729> converter<00:01:48.180> signals<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.700> there's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of the mini converter signals so there's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.929 
of the mini converter signals so there's
a<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> delay<00:01:51.840> I've<00:01:52.170> selected

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
a little bit of a delay I've selected

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.060 
a little bit of a delay I've selected
general<00:01:53.939> MIDI<00:01:54.149> patch<00:01:54.780> number<00:01:55.200> 81<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
general MIDI patch number 81 which is a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.240 
general MIDI patch number 81 which is a
square<00:01:56.549> lead<00:01:57.290> which<00:01:58.290> has<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.829> solid

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
square lead which has a pretty solid

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
square lead which has a pretty solid
attack<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.689> doesn't<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
attack on it so it doesn't like have a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
attack on it so it doesn't like have a
fade<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.860> sound<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.610> any<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> woodwinds

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
fade in sound like any of the woodwinds

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.060 
fade in sound like any of the woodwinds
or<00:02:03.509> something<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.140> here's<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.619> sounds

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
or something so here's what that sounds

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.159 
or something so here's what that sounds
like

see<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.099> know<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.280> pitch<00:02:36.459> tracking<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
see you know the pitch tracking is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.640 
see you know the pitch tracking is
actually<00:02:37.299> really<00:02:37.629> good<00:02:37.930> when<00:02:38.230> I've<00:02:38.349> turned

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
actually really good when I've turned

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.680 
actually really good when I've turned
the<00:02:38.890> highs<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.700> mids<00:02:39.940> all<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.360> way<00:02:40.480> down

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the highs and the mids all the way down

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.050 
the highs and the mids all the way down
even<00:02:41.170> though<00:02:41.349> everything<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.430> guitar<00:02:42.790> is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
even though everything on my guitar is

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.360 
even though everything on my guitar is
set<00:02:43.329> up<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.720> my<00:02:43.989> dry<00:02:44.500> signal<00:02:44.829> my<00:02:45.129> clean

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
set up so that my dry signal my clean

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.300 
set up so that my dry signal my clean
signal<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.849> actually<00:02:46.420> usable<00:02:46.870> guitar<00:02:47.290> sound

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.920 

so<00:02:51.310> now<00:02:51.489> if<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.700> turn<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.480> loop<00:02:52.690> back<00:02:52.900> on

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
so now if I turn that that loop back on

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.720 
so now if I turn that that loop back on
and<00:02:53.319> then<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.500> add<00:02:53.769> some<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.310> know<00:02:54.400> delay

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
and then I can add some you know delay

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.290 
and then I can add some you know delay
after<00:02:54.940> that

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.810 

if<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.870> wet<00:03:03.170> up<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.620> sound<00:03:03.890> like<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.550> if<00:03:04.700> you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
if you wet up the sound like that if you

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.370 
if you wet up the sound like that if you
make<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.420> could<00:03:05.570> get<00:03:05.720> some<00:03:05.930> delay<00:03:06.230> or

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
make the you could get some delay or

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.050 
make the you could get some delay or
reverb<00:03:06.620> or<00:03:07.100> some<00:03:07.610> sort<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:07.880> mouth

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
reverb or some sort of mouth

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.410 
reverb or some sort of mouth
knowledgeable<00:03:08.870> sorry<00:03:09.530> modulation<00:03:10.130> after<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
knowledgeable sorry modulation after the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.510 
knowledgeable sorry modulation after the
mini<00:03:11.960> signal<00:03:12.200> then<00:03:12.470> that'll<00:03:12.890> mask<00:03:13.190> the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
mini signal then that'll mask the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.270 
mini signal then that'll mask the
latency<00:03:14.060> issues<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.450> little<00:03:14.840> bit<00:03:15.050> but<00:03:15.710> it's

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
latency issues a little bit but it's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.310 
latency issues a little bit but it's
pretty<00:03:16.520> good<00:03:16.730> actually<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.360> was<00:03:17.810> pretty

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
pretty good actually I was pretty

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.590 
pretty good actually I was pretty
surprised<00:03:18.680> at<00:03:18.830> how<00:03:19.060> quick<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.300> tracking

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
surprised at how quick the tracking

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.190 
surprised at how quick the tracking
actually<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.460> the<00:03:22.460> official<00:03:23.030> line<00:03:23.240> is<00:03:23.540> 16<00:03:24.020> to

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
actually is the official line is 16 to

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.350 
actually is the official line is 16 to
30<00:03:24.410> milliseconds<00:03:25.130> latency<00:03:25.760> depending<00:03:25.910> on<00:03:26.270> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
30 milliseconds latency depending on the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.990 
30 milliseconds latency depending on the
signal<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.770> by<00:03:27.890> giving<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.340> totally<00:03:28.730> rolled

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
signal so by giving it a totally rolled

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.840 
signal so by giving it a totally rolled
off<00:03:29.500> low-pass<00:03:30.500> signal<00:03:31.130> that<00:03:31.400> way<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.790> really

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
off low-pass signal that way it really

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:53.890 
off low-pass signal that way it really
helps<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:52.340> hopefully<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.970> can<00:03:53.030> hear<00:03:53.300> that<00:03:53.480> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
helps so hopefully you can hear that the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.680 
helps so hopefully you can hear that the
good-good<00:03:55.030> translation<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.180> latency

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
good-good translation of the latency

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.210 
good-good translation of the latency
with<00:03:57.260> two<00:03:57.620> signals<00:03:58.100> mixed<00:03:58.340> together<00:03:58.580> here

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
with two signals mixed together here

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.770
