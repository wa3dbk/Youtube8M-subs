back in there we go

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.780 
back in there we go
and<00:02:41.110> your<00:02:41.350> new<00:02:41.470> air<00:02:41.620> filters<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.610> like

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that it's pretty easy I probably made it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.410 
that it's pretty easy I probably made it
look<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.820> lot<00:02:45.940> harder<00:02:46.180> than<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.540> really<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.989> but
