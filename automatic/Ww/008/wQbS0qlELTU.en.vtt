00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.990
 probability calculation chapter 4 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 Blame feels like his face 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 a wide grin without forgetting 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.809
 he would have consciously contributed or 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.650
 even though it should not 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.680
 why does that make him so happy that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 It should not but how should he do that in 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 teach his heart if he does that in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.260
 one year did not work then goes 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.219
 certainly not in a few moments 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.140
 especially with something like them 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.420
 just indirectly called his brother 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 that was always the highest that they were 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.040
 before they came together 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.809
 the highest compliment my brother 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 and now he says it like 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.890
 of course after a year as 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 you leave the station building 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.640
 the stupid grin finally starts 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.820
 his face disappear and one 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.670
 to make room for nervous stuff 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 manuela knows aldi she almost knows 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 All videos about him from 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.580
 stories probably know 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.380
 nothing from her 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.510
 unless he has is on Facebook 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 there and what's the worst she is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.290
 should not really have anything about him 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.170
 Anyway, do not know more than out 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.350
 No one can be so good at his videos 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.430
 all this in one act has to do this 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.500
 visit to a disaster 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.229
 it will fly up 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 this beautiful shield of lies and one 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.659
 pretend relation to him 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 is strapped the breast 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.890
 shatter and leave only him 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 him with nothing between his heart 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.500
 and the public how should he do that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.500
 only create 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.939
 all these thoughts are crowded into the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 foreground with each step the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.579
 both to go to the car because there 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.070
 manuela siegrist stands as the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.719

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.540

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.340
 you always have black rings around your eyes 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.909
 The breed obviously uncertain with the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.649
 shoulder 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.009
 God makes you that bit 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.709
 frankly, that's how I am 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.300
 my mother was born when panda opinion 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.410
 grins even wider and sticks to it 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.420

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.700

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.660
 Surprised and boxing fist against her 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.640
 paddles umbrella beats saltos the love 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.250
 his life and his girlfriend 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.150
 just per moored what is wrong 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.150
 with this world 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.350
 but arrived in the apartment 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.670
 First on the sofa after a few 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.620
 seconds you can snore softly 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.450
 hear manu giggles blame sighs oh 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.460
 Come on, it's really cute 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 that's the problem 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.120
 with what he and she sees the completely 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.170

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.360

 he is here with you he sleeps up 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.510
 Why is your sofa so beautiful? 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.020
 what does not come to you just too 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.760
 to let 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.590
 you 've broken it before 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 and this game is not just about 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.520
 your heart is thinking about the science rebuke 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.810
 and raises his hands reassuringly 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.280
 hey stock something I have here 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.150
 missed you are now about him 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 or what manuela shakes his head no 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.370
 days and you know exactly I get up 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.920
 him completely different but adidas is me 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.780
 you always thought you were exaggerating 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.250
 yet how much more wonderful than you him 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.480
 have described and now I can 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.580
 even less like you imagine him 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.550
 could leave just because you are scared 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.440
 before you or better always 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.610
 still hate censure lowers the view 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.150
 I do not expect you that either 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.600
 understand 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.800
 I do not understand it myself but it 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.480
 has become much better 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.890
 I have it in public today 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.970
 she hugs an eyebrow 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.260
 Well, that was good, too 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.020
 but not at least it is a start 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.060
 or not herself and stroke him 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.160
 on the cheek as cautious as if 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.160
 rather fragile blame 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.150
 right now you are ringing 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.900
 Mobile phone in your pocket she grumbles 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.310
 and today out and accept calls yes 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.880
 she turns red 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.950
 Felix had twisted his eyes yes we 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.610

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.050
 I'll ask 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.450
 She holds the phone and sees eagle 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.950
 apologetic to those up there 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.710
 seen that we brought someone 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.520
 and want to know who that is 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.290
 want to come down then it swallows 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.419
 In short, you only hear the phone 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.750
 scold that it does not take so long 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.630
 times snores still wait a minute 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.220
 Blame turns jerkily to the sofa 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.440
 which of course no longer sleeps 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.940
 christin broad and so I mean 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.240

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.220

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.490

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.010
 just before anything blame 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.760
 can say against it 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.700
 she takes her hand off the phone felix yes 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.200
 nobody mind if you are accommodated 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.170
 ask the mum drinking from the phone 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.890

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.840

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.840
 Get ready for a surprise 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.890
 hey people so i did not just want it 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.710
 just a moment thoughts are still 98 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.790
 Subscribers that I do 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.440
 probably also 100 subscribers 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.090
 special was a bit puny in the 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.890
 compared to other super great 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.090
 People 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.320
 but well, I do not know what exactly 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.520
 You can give her suggestions in the 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.430
 Comments may also be written 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.400
 if I do a field and I wanted it 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.930
 still mention and ask because still 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.270
 better had written a comment 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.430
 that I saved in a comment 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:04.130
 that would be an effectual relationship 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.840
 between babbel and his mannen because 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.180
 Actually, I thought that was it 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.440
 already come over in the parts 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.760
 because it has already been mentioned several times 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.130
 because of that, that they are as his 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.470
 he has even spent girlfriend 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.090
 Literally said and so and it is 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.190
 but actually already become clear so 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.960
 I always wanted to say that officially 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.090
 is actually an effect drawing and 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.810
 so still get along why if that 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.490
 not somehow clear and yes 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.690

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.980
