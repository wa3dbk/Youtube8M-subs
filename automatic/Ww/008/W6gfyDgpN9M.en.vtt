00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
doing the old universe Harley Quinn I

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.619 
doing the old universe Harley Quinn I
was<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.710> oh<00:00:40.950> she<00:00:41.460> didn't<00:00:41.700> really<00:00:41.730> star

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
was a bit like oh she didn't really star

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.630 
was a bit like oh she didn't really star
in<00:00:42.870> anything<00:00:43.200> until<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> new<00:00:43.829> 52<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.520> she

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
in anything until the new 52 like she

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.279 
in anything until the new 52 like she
kind<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.850> fell<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.180> obscurity<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> old

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
kind of fell into obscurity in the old

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
kind of fell into obscurity in the old
universe<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> bit<00:00:47.460> risky<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
universe this is a bit risky but it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
universe this is a bit risky but it
could<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.230> could<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.770> many

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
could be good there could be so many

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.260 
could be good there could be so many
things<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.430> could<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.879> Harley

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
things that you could do with Harley

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.260 
things that you could do with Harley
being<00:00:51.449> trapped<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> dome<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.670> quite<00:00:54.000> bad

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
being trapped in a dome it was quite bad

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
being trapped in a dome it was quite bad
honestly<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.500> wasted<00:00:55.920> opportunity

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
honestly a really wasted opportunity

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
honestly a really wasted opportunity
basically<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.649> Harley<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
basically we just see that Harley was a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
basically we just see that Harley was a
bit<00:00:59.489> crazy<00:00:59.640> before<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.329> dome<00:01:00.539> went<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
bit crazy before the dome went up and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.110 
bit crazy before the dome went up and
I'm<00:01:01.770> after<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> dome<00:01:02.399> went<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.760> she<00:01:03.000> got

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I'm after the dome went up she got

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
I'm after the dome went up she got
therapy<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.110> isn't<00:01:04.350> crazy<00:01:04.500> anymore<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
therapy and isn't crazy anymore and it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.310 
therapy and isn't crazy anymore and it
follows<00:01:05.880> her<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.270> being<00:01:06.420> crazy<00:01:07.130> that's<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
follows her not being crazy that's it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.450 
follows her not being crazy that's it
there's<00:01:10.320> nothing<00:01:10.470> else<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> say<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.130> i
