prefer hand-drawn animation / computer
animation<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.849> here's<00:02:27.090> why<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.629> feel<00:02:28.200> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
animation and here's why I feel that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.839 
animation and here's why I feel that
hand<00:02:28.590> drawn<00:02:28.770> animation<00:02:28.800> engrosses<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
hand drawn animation engrosses the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.640 
hand drawn animation engrosses the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
viewer more to the story because of how

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.520 
viewer more to the story because of how

detailed and polished the background

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.589 
detailed and polished the background
characters<00:02:34.530> are<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.950> said<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.909> grosses<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.480> of

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
characters are I said it grosses more of

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.479 
characters are I said it grosses more of
the<00:02:36.689> viewer<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.260> because<00:02:37.799> it's<00:02:37.980> easier<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
the viewer in because it's easier to

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.309 
the viewer in because it's easier to
imagine<00:02:38.609> yourself<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.329> scenery<00:02:39.629> like<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
imagine yourself in scenery like the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.649 
imagine yourself in scenery like the
movie<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:41.549> done<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.760> CG<00:02:42.239> I'm

not saying shows me the CGI are bad I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.789 
not saying shows me the CGI are bad I
just<00:02:45.420> prefer<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.780> hand-drawn<00:02:46.200> animation

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.089 
care for there is one flaw but it's the
longest<00:03:41.219> one<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.359> plot<00:03:42.719> holes<00:03:43.019> kind<00:03:43.469> of<00:03:43.650> her<00:03:43.829> I

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
longest one the plot holes kind of her I

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.039 
longest one the plot holes kind of her I
know<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.609> complimented<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.389> story<00:03:45.689> earlier

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
know I complimented the story earlier

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.990 
know I complimented the story earlier
but<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.739> doesn't<00:03:46.979> mean<00:03:47.129> there<00:03:47.340> aren't<00:03:47.579> plot

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
but that doesn't mean there aren't plot

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.059 
but that doesn't mean there aren't plot
holes<00:03:48.299> in<00:03:48.509> it<00:03:48.629> first<00:03:49.409> one<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.769> more<00:03:49.919> of<00:03:50.009> a

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
holes in it first one is more of a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.770 
holes in it first one is more of a
nitpick<00:03:50.699> but<00:03:50.729> how<00:03:51.180> did<00:03:51.239> some<00:03:51.569> of<00:03:51.689> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
nitpick but how did some of the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.539 
nitpick but how did some of the
characters<00:03:52.290> parents<00:03:52.709> make<00:03:52.919> it<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.159> the<00:03:53.280> Great

surprised yes but not sobbing this was

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.850 
surprised yes but not sobbing this was
