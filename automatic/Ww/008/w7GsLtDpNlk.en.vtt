00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.069
 Hello everybody 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.830
 Today I show you my inlaid 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.450
 Fathers he is made quickly and leaves 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.469
 well a while in the refrigerator 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.480
 store 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 so you also have one fix 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.439
 small appetizer prepared as ingredients 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.980
 I have fathers of fresh garlic here 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:29.939
 a chilli pepper allspice something 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.109
 oil then salt and a dried one 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.420
 herbal mixture 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 I chose Italian herbs 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320
 because they taste the best 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.360
 First, I'll get the error out of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.820
 then take the chili wash 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.719
 and about a third of it in fine 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.059
 cut rings 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.070
 I'll peel two of the garlic 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.239
 But you should take that after yours 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 taste decide 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.230
 it's best you take a good one 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.539
 lockable plastic box in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 Fathers fit into it as closely as possible 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.210
 you will need less oil later on 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.420
 to water 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.290
 I put the father in the plastic box 1 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.659
 you see he fits in well 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 me the spices 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.820
 the garlic I cut through and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.680
 then put it with the bowl in the press 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.159
 gently press and with the knife 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.110
 abolish when you are on the garlic 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.939
 you can turn that off then 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.869
 later simply out of the press 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.210
 pull out 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.650
 the advantage is it almost stays 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 nothing back in the press 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.390
 It is also allowed to garlic 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 be quite fresh is namely mild and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.619
 I do not smell that strong 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.509
 about a quarter teaspoon salt of the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.340
 herbs should be one to two teaspoons 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.500
 all you have to do is pour it on with oil 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 the fathers should be completely covered 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 Therefore choose the smallest possible box 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.189
 that's enough garlic 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 rub the cheese with the oil 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.920
 can be well distributed underneath 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.079
 and you're done, that's it 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.969
 from now only close 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.459
 in the fridge should the fathers 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.129
 Pull through well for at least four days 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.240
 the father had a short week time 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.220
 and is well marinated 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.980
 is now ready serve you can him 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.030
 crumble over the salad or so your 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.310
 spice up pasta 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.830
 or you can have it as a starter 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.660
 I serve one here 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.170
 starter plate with dried 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.690
 tomatoes olives hot peppers and of course 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.150
 so prepared for the inserted father 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 see my pickled sheep cheese ready 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.390
 A flatbread fits very well with this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.440
