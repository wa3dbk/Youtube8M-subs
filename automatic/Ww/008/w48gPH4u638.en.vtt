00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.250
 ah 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.500
 very good kids we started with a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 new minecraft video and good today I'm going 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.740
 to show you what you will have to do 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 both to reverse the redstone signal 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 as to raise it the most 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.830
 compact possible ok let's start 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.170
 by the principle that is the inverted 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.119
 order redstone to make an inverted 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.059
 network with what you are going to need is what 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.190
 next a stone a torch of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.409
 this torch type of the redstone and now 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 let's make a network cable stones by 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:43.830
 this side and another one for this other then 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 we do like that and that's the way it is and how do you see if 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.940
 one side of the inverted the signal is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 lit on the other side is off 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 so if we put a switch and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.089
 we light this side as you see 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 it automatically shuts down on the other side of 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.850
 What is the use of this, I am going to give you a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.229
 practical case of this mechanism that already 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 you will have seen it in the title of this 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.939
 video that are the lamps or the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 lampposts basically then we 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.990
 we use this block here which is called 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.409
 sunlight sensor 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.750
 and at the other end we connect a 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.810
 Reston lamp as you see when 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.509
 sunlight because this block activates the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
 redstone signal the inverted the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.470
 invests and therefore on the other side 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.220
 it is off so when it is day 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.370
 the lamp is off if we 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.860
 we do night 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.810
 as you see from this side now the signal 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.090
 is off this side is on 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.570
 and consequently we have lit the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.250
 lamps ok let's put it back on 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.510
 day the best some you will have 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.220
 asked about these mechanisms 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.720
 here to tell you that I have 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.420
 just the previous video we're going from this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.070
 series in that video I explain how it's done 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.890
 and I'll leave you in the description of 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.960
 this other video a link to himself for 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.900
 that you can see it since in it he explained 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.060
 perfectly how do you have to do to 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.340
 build gadgets of this type or well 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.560
 to put day of night activate or 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.370
 turn off the rain then we go with 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.770
 the second part of the video that was how 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.750
 upload a red stones signal from the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.580
 as compact as possible for it what 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 first thing we have to do is thus a 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.110
 stone pirulus and now we eliminate os 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.560
 we leave one we eliminate we leave another 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.410
 we eliminate and so it is worth and now what 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.440
 let's do they are really what they are 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.709
 are successive and invested from redstone 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.970
 then let's put torches like that 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.620
 ok and we have achieved the effect that I 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.900
 I wanted it to be that when the signal is 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.290
 active on this side here at the tip of 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.019
 the lamp is not lit it because 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.450
 so if we put a lamp here 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.579
 we connect it when it gets dark 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.310
 Well, if it's turned up here, it'll be 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.629
 on and backwards we are all going to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.269
 prove it is worth as you see it has been turned on 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.220
 and as you can see it has been extinguished, and with 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.829
 this I'm going to say goodbye here has been a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.540
 short video but I think that pretty 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.420
 interesting since the possibilities of 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.549
 this machine here are huge and nothing 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.859
 that we see in future videos that already 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.870
 you will see new gadgets using this 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.639
 from here the inverted and that I hope that you 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.069
 have liked this video and that any 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:26.040
 doubt or what you want then you leave 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.870
 comments and nothing said what I hope that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.669
 you liked this video and see you 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.669
 in coming goodbye videos
