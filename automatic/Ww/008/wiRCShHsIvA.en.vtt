gonna hop over the back I'll make myself
a<00:01:12.170> quick<00:01:12.350> pencil<00:01:12.800> sketch<00:01:16.810> well<00:01:17.810> I've<00:01:17.900> wandered

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
a quick pencil sketch well I've wandered

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.290 
a quick pencil sketch well I've wandered
around<00:01:18.380> looking<00:01:19.280> for<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> good<00:01:19.640> position<00:01:20.000> I

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
around looking for a good position I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.630 
around looking for a good position I
think<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:20.810> like<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.229> one<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:22.460> got<00:01:22.610> a

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
think I like this one because it's got a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.820 
think I like this one because it's got a
little<00:01:22.820> bit<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.180> everything<00:01:23.450> I'm<00:01:24.410> now<00:01:24.649> going

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
little bit of everything I'm now going

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
little bit of everything I'm now going
to<00:01:24.950> make<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.790> short<00:01:26.060> pencil<00:01:26.780> sketch<00:01:27.550> okay<00:01:28.550> so

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
to make a short pencil sketch okay so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.960 
to make a short pencil sketch okay so
the<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.840> main<00:01:30.500> thing<00:01:30.800> with<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.009> scene<00:01:31.340> like

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
the the main thing with a scene like

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.730 
the the main thing with a scene like
this<00:01:32.180> which<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.540> quite<00:01:32.780> complex<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.619> there's

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
this which is quite complex and there's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.330 
this which is quite complex and there's
a<00:01:33.770> lot<00:01:33.890> happening<00:01:34.330> it's<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:35.570> get<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
a lot happening it's to just get the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.889 
a lot happening it's to just get the
main<00:01:37.340> shapes<00:01:37.869> established<00:01:38.869> quite<00:01:39.410> early<00:01:39.710> on

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
main shapes established quite early on

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.270 
main shapes established quite early on
but<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.020> rocks<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.500> background<00:01:42.950> which

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
but the rocks on the background which

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.109 
but the rocks on the background which
are<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.450> pencil<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.020> outline<00:01:45.530> first<00:01:46.119> to

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
are just pencil in the outline first to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.529 
are just pencil in the outline first to
do<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.450> before<00:01:47.600> putting<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.320> any<00:01:48.530> serious

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
do this before putting in any serious

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:59.830 
do this before putting in any serious
details<00:01:55.179> drawing<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:57.740> outer<00:01:57.920> shape<00:01:58.840> of

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
details drawing the the outer shape of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.859 
details drawing the the outer shape of
the<00:02:00.050> rocks<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.819> preliminary<00:02:02.270> sketch

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
the rocks this as a preliminary sketch

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.820 
the rocks this as a preliminary sketch
it's<00:02:03.649> got<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.130> means<00:02:05.000> something<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.810> me<00:02:05.840> when<00:02:06.770> I

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's got so means something to me when I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.100 
it's got so means something to me when I
get<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.130> back<00:02:07.280> into<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.670> studio<00:02:08.149> they're

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
get it back into the studio they're

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.719 
get it back into the studio they're
gonna<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:09.349> careful<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.950> put<00:02:10.069> too<00:02:10.190> much<00:02:10.520> in

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
gonna be careful not to put too much in

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.610 
gonna be careful not to put too much in
and<00:02:10.880> not<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.300> confuse<00:02:12.140> myself<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:15.050> gonna<00:02:15.349> use

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and not to confuse myself I'm gonna use

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.520 
and not to confuse myself I'm gonna use
some<00:02:15.790> Prussian<00:02:16.790> blue<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.530> French

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
some Prussian blue and French

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
some Prussian blue and French
ultramarine<00:02:18.770> for<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.790> sky<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.750> push

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
ultramarine for the sky it's the push

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.170 
ultramarine for the sky it's the push
and<00:02:21.319> blue<00:02:21.500> first<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.190> get<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> little<00:02:22.760> bit<00:02:22.940> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
and blue first I get a little bit of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.510 
and blue first I get a little bit of
French<00:02:23.630> ultramarine<00:02:23.870> mixed<00:02:24.709> as<00:02:24.830> well<00:02:25.069> so<00:02:25.370> it's

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
French ultramarine mixed as well so it's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.309 
French ultramarine mixed as well so it's
ready<00:02:26.440> okay<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.709> goes<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.720> there<00:02:32.959> we<00:02:33.110> have

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
ready okay here goes so there we have

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.000 
ready okay here goes so there we have
the<00:02:33.830> finished<00:02:34.099> painting<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.900> waterfall

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.910 

the<00:02:40.010> whole<00:02:40.220> impact<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.480> waterfall<00:02:41.960> comes

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
the whole impact of a waterfall comes

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.670 
the whole impact of a waterfall comes
from<00:02:43.220> its<00:02:43.370> contrast<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.330> light<00:02:44.360> tones<00:02:45.050> against

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
from its contrast of light tones against

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.270 
from its contrast of light tones against
dark<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.480> imperative<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.740> retain

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
dark so it's imperative that you retain

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.490 
dark so it's imperative that you retain
those<00:02:49.580> highlights<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.630> go<00:02:50.810> along

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.199 

so<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.890> most<00:02:59.069> important<00:02:59.790> thing<00:02:59.849> when

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
so the most important thing when

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.960 
so the most important thing when
painting<00:03:00.720> crags<00:03:01.200> were<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.620> fact<00:03:01.920> rocks<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.670> any

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
painting crags were in fact rocks of any

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.949 
painting crags were in fact rocks of any
sort<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> maintain<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:05.150> random<00:03:06.150> quality<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
sort is to maintain a random quality to

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.490 
sort is to maintain a random quality to
it<00:03:07.140> also<00:03:07.530> use<00:03:08.400> tone<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.269> color<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:10.019> create

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it also use tone and color to create

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.399 
it also use tone and color to create
depth<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.310> your<00:03:11.459> painting<00:03:11.970> distant<00:03:12.750> objects

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
depth in your painting distant objects

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.399 
depth in your painting distant objects
such<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:13.950> distant<00:03:14.579> mountings<00:03:15.150> should<00:03:15.989> appear
