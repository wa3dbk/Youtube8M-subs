when<00:00:00.120> you<00:00:00.210> learn<00:00:00.420> these<00:00:00.570> scales<00:00:00.840> you<00:00:01.050> know

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:01.199 
when you learn these scales you know

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.950 
when you learn these scales you know
your<00:00:04.910> and<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.089> doesn't<00:00:06.359> really<00:00:06.509> sound<00:00:06.810> like

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
your and it doesn't really sound like

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.930 
your and it doesn't really sound like
anything<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.649> think<00:00:08.040> maybe<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
anything and I think maybe the the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.180 
anything and I think maybe the the
challenge<00:00:09.389> might<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.679> take<00:00:10.920> something

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
challenge might be is to take something

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
challenge might be is to take something
let's<00:00:11.730> say<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> was<00:00:12.240> doing<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.570> lesson<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.110> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
let's say for I was doing a lesson and a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.570 
let's say for I was doing a lesson and a
student<00:00:13.679> could<00:00:13.950> play<00:00:16.220> goodnight<00:00:17.220> say<00:00:17.400> well

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
student could play goodnight say well

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.410 
student could play goodnight say well
let's<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:17.880> take<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.180> same<00:00:18.510> riff<00:00:18.990> right

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
let's just take that same riff right

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
let's just take that same riff right
instead<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:25.260> suddenly<00:00:25.590> changed<00:00:25.680> it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
instead and that suddenly changed it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.930 
instead and that suddenly changed it
that's<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> simple<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:29.670> maybe<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.949> go

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.430 

and<00:00:35.940> suddenly<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.870> weird<00:00:37.079> down

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and suddenly it's kind of a weird down

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.950 
and suddenly it's kind of a weird down
slightly<00:00:37.860> ahead<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.129> me<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.180> subtle<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
slightly ahead of me it's so subtle and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
slightly ahead of me it's so subtle and
it<00:00:40.410> stays<00:00:40.649> within<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.160> eleven<00:00:41.610> note<00:00:41.790> thing

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it stays within that eleven note thing

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
it stays within that eleven note thing
so<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.770> you're<00:00:43.980> playing<00:00:44.520> over

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
so it's not like if you're playing over

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.180 
so it's not like if you're playing over
this<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.300> going

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.549 

that's<00:00:49.640> just<00:00:49.940> totally<00:00:50.420> out<00:00:50.450> there

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.630 

it<00:00:55.559> still<00:00:55.800> sounds<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.100> you're<00:00:56.339> kind<00:00:56.519> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
it still sounds like you're kind of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.149 
it still sounds like you're kind of
doing<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> blues<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.980> taking<00:00:58.980> some

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
doing a blues thing and just taking some

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.009 
doing a blues thing and just taking some
liberties<00:00:59.339> with<00:00:59.609> some<00:00:59.969> extra<00:01:00.329> notes<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.839> so

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
liberties with some extra notes and so

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.830 
liberties with some extra notes and so
first<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.460> thing<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.390> lot

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
we'll just play the symmetrical scale

we'll just play the symmetrical scale
down<00:01:11.759> on<00:01:11.969> them<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.749> tall<00:01:12.990> tang<00:01:13.289> with<00:01:13.499> the<00:01:13.590> open

from<00:01:17.939> playing<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.359> a<00:01:18.479> trio<00:01:19.020> quite<00:01:19.409> often<00:01:19.649> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
from playing with a trio quite often a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
from playing with a trio quite often a
like<00:01:20.579> idea<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> using<00:01:21.329> open<00:01:21.450> strings<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.049> much

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
like idea of using open strings as much

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.209 
like idea of using open strings as much
as<00:01:22.380> possible<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.249> so<00:01:23.819> rich<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.539> that<00:01:25.039> if<00:01:26.039> you

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
as possible and so rich like that if you

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.480 
as possible and so rich like that if you
can<00:01:26.399> use<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.819> or<00:01:26.880> less<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.390> few<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.079> same

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
can use more or less a few the same

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.649 
can use more or less a few the same
remaining

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.450 

there<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.530> things<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.009> fun<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
there are things that are just fun to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
there are things that are just fun to
look<00:01:35.609> at<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.329> about<00:01:36.479> play<00:01:41.420> any<00:01:42.420> scale

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
look at and think about play any scale

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.779 
look at and think about play any scale
that<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.319> of<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> has<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.130> common

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
that you know of that has got common

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.279 
that you know of that has got common
tones<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.329> reflected<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.020> open

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
tones that are reflected in the open

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.929 
tones that are reflected in the open
strings<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.829> work<00:01:47.159> into<00:01:47.369> something<00:01:47.789> like

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
strings you can work into something like

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.510 
strings you can work into something like

not to me that's really spooky because
