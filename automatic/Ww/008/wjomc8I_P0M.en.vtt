to be a significant DPS increase if you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.700 
to be a significant DPS increase if you
switch<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.520> these<00:01:02.760> talents<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.589> always

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
we're going to go with these glyphs here

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.179 
we're going to go with these glyphs here
there's<00:01:14.189> no<00:01:14.340> other<00:01:14.460> glyphs<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.000> frost<00:01:15.509> and

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
there's no other glyphs for frost and

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
there's no other glyphs for frost and
that's<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.659> into

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that's that and we're going to get into

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
that's that and we're going to get into
our<00:01:18.930> rotation<00:01:19.320> rotation<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:19.979> simple<00:01:20.299> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
our rotation rotation is very simple we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.260 
our rotation rotation is very simple we
have<00:01:21.509> prox<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.770> level<00:01:22.979> 100<00:01:23.310> major<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
have prox if you are level 100 major I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.080 
have prox if you are level 100 major I
think<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> should<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.320> prox<00:01:25.650> are

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
think you should know what prox are

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
think you should know what prox are
we're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.360> frost<00:01:27.659> fireball<00:01:28.110> proxim

we're going to get frost fireball proxim
we're<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:28.950> ice<00:01:29.009> Lance<00:01:29.430> prox<00:01:29.869> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
we're going to get ice Lance prox and

we're going to get ice Lance prox and
our<00:01:30.990> priorities<00:01:31.530> use<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.130> frost<00:01:32.460> firebolt

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
our priorities use the frost firebolt

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.319 
our priorities use the frost firebolt
prox<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:35.009> our<00:01:35.340> next<00:01:35.400> priority<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.090> use
