couple things to keep in mind here I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.120 
couple things to keep in mind here I
have<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> 10-man<00:00:33.989> version<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.980> are

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
have it on the 10-man version there are

have it on the 10-man version there are
more<00:00:35.309> mobs<00:00:35.550> than<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> 25-man<00:00:36.510> version<00:00:36.960> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
character when you reset the instance

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
character when you reset the instance
they<00:01:16.439> won't<00:01:16.650> respond<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> only<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> do

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
they won't respond so you only got to do

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.070 
they won't respond so you only got to do
that<00:01:17.909> once<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.600> they're<00:01:18.869> really

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
that once and you know they're really

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480 
that once and you know they're really
easy<00:01:19.140> there's<00:01:19.500> nothing<00:01:19.770> special<00:01:19.979> about<00:01:20.250> them

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
easy there's nothing special about them

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969 
easy there's nothing special about them
and<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.689> pretty<00:01:21.750> good<00:01:22.049> you'll<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.650> me<00:01:22.799> get

but<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> bosses<00:01:42.930> should<00:01:43.320> reset<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.070> just

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
but the bosses should reset and you just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.819 
but the bosses should reset and you just
do<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.520> over<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:44.970> over<00:01:45.030> again<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> only

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
do that over and over again the only

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.639 
do that over and over again the only
downside<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.549> run<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.360> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> try

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
downside to this run is that if you try

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
downside to this run is that if you try
to<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.310> than<00:01:50.340> five<00:01:50.759> times<00:01:51.090> every

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to do this more than five times every

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149 
to do this more than five times every
hour<00:01:51.479> you'll<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> message<00:01:52.470> saying<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
hour you'll get a message saying that

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.039 
hour you'll get a message saying that
you<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.820> entered<00:01:54.149> too<00:01:54.299> many<00:01:54.479> instances

you have entered too many instances

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.760

recently<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.180> downside<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:58.500> not

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
recently so that's one downside I'm not

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.100 
recently so that's one downside I'm not
exactly<00:01:59.399> sure<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> exact<00:02:00.360> number<00:02:00.750> because
