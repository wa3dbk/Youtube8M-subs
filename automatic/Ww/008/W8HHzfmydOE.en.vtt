with<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> 12<00:00:01.140> hour<00:00:01.970> journey<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.360> nine<00:00:04.049> hour

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
with a 12 hour journey and nine hour

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.860 
with a 12 hour journey and nine hour
time<00:00:04.680> difference<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.819> if<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.540> follow<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
time difference so if you follow the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.839 
time difference so if you follow the
textbooks<00:00:07.379> really<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.830> should<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:08.250> really

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
textbooks really we should be really

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.839 
textbooks really we should be really
adjusting<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.870> new<00:00:10.200> hours<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:11.219> about<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
adjusting to the new hours in about a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.089 
adjusting to the new hours in about a
week<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.870> had<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.049> play<00:00:13.259> our<00:00:13.469> first<00:00:13.620> game<00:00:13.889> in

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
week we had to play our first game in

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.369 
week we had to play our first game in
four<00:00:14.280> days<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.330> came<00:00:15.480> from<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.780> game<00:00:15.929> which

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
four days and we came from a game which

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.290 
four days and we came from a game which
was<00:00:16.529> Sunderland<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.250> then<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.880> strained<00:00:18.150> her

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
was Sunderland and then got strained her

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.870 
was Sunderland and then got strained her
flight<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> has<00:00:19.050> been<00:00:19.080> quite<00:00:19.410> hard<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
flight so it has been quite hard and a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.359 
flight so it has been quite hard and a
schedule<00:00:21.810> that's<00:00:22.020> been<00:00:22.320> hard<00:00:22.740> too<00:00:22.949> much<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
schedule that's been hard too much for

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.950 
schedule that's been hard too much for
any<00:00:23.490> other<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.300> I've<00:00:24.390> ever<00:00:24.539> heard<00:00:24.750> about

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
any other that I've ever heard about

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
any other that I've ever heard about
before<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> nine<00:00:26.369> hour<00:00:26.609> difference<00:00:26.880> we

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
before with the nine hour difference we

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.490 
before with the nine hour difference we
worked<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.720> well<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.080> never<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
worked out well we're never going to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.040 
worked out well we're never going to
acclimatize<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.599> try<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> do

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
acclimatize to it so what we try to do

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
acclimatize to it so what we try to do
is<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> work<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.219> five<00:00:32.700> hour<00:00:32.910> time

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
is to work out a five hour time

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.540 
is to work out a five hour time
difference<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.829> did<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.309> got<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
difference so what we did was we got the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.360 
difference so what we did was we got the
players<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.210> adjust<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> new<00:00:36.930> time<00:00:37.230> zone

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
players to adjust to the new time zone

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.830 
players to adjust to the new time zone
but<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.670> we'd<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.000> doing<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
but what we'd actually doing is going to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
but what we'd actually doing is going to
bed<00:00:39.960> quite<00:00:40.200> late<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.829> working<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.340> quite

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
bed quite late and working out quite

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.700 
bed quite late and working out quite
late<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.059> we're<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.270> working<00:00:43.079> roughly

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
late so we're actually working roughly

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
late so we're actually working roughly
45<00:00:44.129> hours<00:00:44.340> hundreds<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> former<00:00:44.910> London<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
45 hours hundreds of former London and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.610 
45 hours hundreds of former London and
that's<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.989> were<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.350> their<00:00:46.469> body

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that's what we were just in their body

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
that's what we were just in their body
clocks<00:00:46.920> too<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.450> gives<00:00:48.600> us<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> little

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
clocks too and that gives us a little

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
clocks too and that gives us a little
bit<00:00:49.079> more<00:00:49.230> leeway<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> really

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
bit more leeway this is a really

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
bit more leeway this is a really
individual<00:00:51.360> thing<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.500> does<00:00:52.710> vary

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
individual thing so it really does vary

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160 
individual thing so it really does vary
from<00:00:53.250> Player<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> Player<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.020> been

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
from Player to Player and we have been

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
from Player to Player and we have been
using<00:00:55.199> some<00:00:55.530> medical<00:00:55.890> aids<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:57.420> sort<00:00:57.539> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
using some medical aids and to sort of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.000 
using some medical aids and to sort of
help<00:00:57.809> adjustable<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.649> occasions

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
help adjustable there are occasions

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.170 
help adjustable there are occasions
where<00:00:59.129> people<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.520> wide<00:00:59.789> awake<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
where people are just wide awake and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.490 
where people are just wide awake and
have<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> play<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> game<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> following<00:01:01.199> day<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
have to play a game of following day and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
have to play a game of following day and
it's<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:01.920> acceptable<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.609> sobriety<00:01:03.510> or

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it's just not acceptable and sobriety or

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
it's just not acceptable and sobriety or
that<00:01:03.930> yeah<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.280> thing<00:01:05.519> would<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.729> using

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that yeah the other thing would be using

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
that yeah the other thing would be using
is<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.119> light<00:01:06.479> exposure<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.619> exposing

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is actually light exposure it's exposing

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.789 
is actually light exposure it's exposing
them<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> light<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.960> some<00:01:10.200> good<00:01:10.380> evidence<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
them to light the some good evidence to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.500 
them to light the some good evidence to
say<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> light<00:01:11.520> exposure<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.000> retinas<00:01:12.450> are

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
say that light exposure to retinas are

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.109 
say that light exposure to retinas are
actually<00:01:12.840> changes<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.470> body<00:01:13.560> clock<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
actually changes your body clock and and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
actually changes your body clock and and
we've<00:01:15.570> been<00:01:15.689> using<00:01:15.840> sort<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.200> actual<00:01:16.500> body

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we've been using sort of an actual body

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
we've been using sort of an actual body
home<00:01:17.130> called<00:01:17.400> melatonin<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.970> well<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
home called melatonin as well which is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
home called melatonin as well which is
another<00:01:18.570> sleeping<00:01:19.049> aid<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> try<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.650> sort<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
another sleeping aid to try and sort of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
another sleeping aid to try and sort of
again<00:01:20.549> regulate<00:01:21.270> their<00:01:21.540> sleeping<00:01:22.259> patterns

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
again regulate their sleeping patterns

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.730 
again regulate their sleeping patterns
so<00:01:23.250> combination<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> above<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
so combination of all of the above and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.870 
so combination of all of the above and
it<00:01:25.740> does<00:01:25.920> help<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.280> an<00:01:26.460> experienced

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it does help to have an experienced

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.940 
it does help to have an experienced
manager<00:01:27.330> who<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.990> support<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.829> the

manager who can support you in the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.520 
manager who can support you in the
decision-making<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.110> pack<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
decision-making and pack all the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
decision-making and pack all the
conditioner<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> very

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
conditioner is actually a very

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.980 
conditioner is actually a very
experienced<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.659> done<00:01:33.930> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
experienced that have all done this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
experienced that have all done this
