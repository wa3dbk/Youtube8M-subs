00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.040
 very good everyone here we are 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.650
 minecraft and today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.719
 make a portal to the moon without having to 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.019
 use any good mode what 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:18.610
 we will need dynamite obsidian 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:25.800
 sponge lighter and emeralds we will begin 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.800
 Carlos and Diana will put 1 2 3 4 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.300
 two 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 down here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.630
 for we will break twice and put 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.280
 sponges 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.280
 there there 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.450
 and here we will put obsidian 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.930
 OK 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.320
 now also we will fill all 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.390
 we will surround sponge 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.430
 since sponges what is used to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.430
 go to the moon or what's the student 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.680
 now we will make a little path since we are going to 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.680
 activate a 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.430
 challenge now we will take restore 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.400
 A) Yes 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.400
 and a lever 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.790
 we will take the rest we will put 2 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.360
 and we will do 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.330
 I do it like this in this way but you can 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.330
 do it however you want 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.379
 it's worth what you have to do now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.930
 with the emerald 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.969
 we will have to do here 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.969
 so we remove this 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.650
 OK 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.090
 it's perfect once we've put everything 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:56.610
 all this I did not follow you from above 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.500
 so calm that it will not explode nor 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.490
 nothing like that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.520
 since it's a way to go to some 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.230
 best 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.209
 OK 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.290
 now we have to put here 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 just below 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.180
 we will get under 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.500
 under 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.470
 where we see the range of 0 because if not 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 it does not work 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 we will give the white one and it will take us 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.040
 direct to the moon 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.900
 good as you see those who have followed 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.260
 my steps you finish that sunny no 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.810
 could there be no portal to the moon or 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.210
 it's good that it was activated that has 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:00.100
 been all ha 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.100
