so<00:00:05.500> to<00:00:05.560> answer<00:00:05.800> the<00:00:05.980> question<00:00:06.370> what<00:00:06.670> is<00:00:06.700> the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:06.940 
so to answer the question what is the

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.120 
so to answer the question what is the
best<00:00:07.060> way<00:00:07.210> to<00:00:07.330> fertilize<00:00:07.840> we<00:00:08.530> have<00:00:08.650> to<00:00:08.770> really

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
best way to fertilize we have to really

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.820 
best way to fertilize we have to really
address<00:00:09.340> two<00:00:09.700> things<00:00:09.969> one<00:00:10.600> is<00:00:10.870> what's<00:00:11.530> in<00:00:11.710> the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
address two things one is what's in the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.450 
address two things one is what's in the
fertilizer<00:00:12.220> and<00:00:12.580> two<00:00:13.980> what<00:00:14.980> is<00:00:15.100> it<00:00:15.220> that<00:00:15.309> we're

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
fertilizer and two what is it that we're

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.760 
fertilizer and two what is it that we're
planning<00:00:15.790> to<00:00:15.820> fertilize<00:00:16.270> so<00:00:17.020> starting<00:00:17.619> with

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
planning to fertilize so starting with

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.500 
planning to fertilize so starting with
what's<00:00:17.980> in<00:00:18.099> the<00:00:18.130> fertilizer<00:00:18.640> it's<00:00:19.000> important

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
what's in the fertilizer it's important

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.410 
what's in the fertilizer it's important
to<00:00:19.660> note<00:00:19.900> that<00:00:20.830> any<00:00:21.160> bag<00:00:21.490> fertilize<00:00:22.180> really

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
to note that any bag fertilize really

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.720 
to note that any bag fertilize really
look<00:00:22.600> at<00:00:22.780> has<00:00:22.990> three<00:00:23.410> numbers<00:00:23.800> on<00:00:24.010> it<00:00:24.160> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050 

those<00:00:27.730> three<00:00:28.000> numbers<00:00:28.359> represent<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:28.990> nitrogen

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
those three numbers represent a nitrogen

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.519 
those three numbers represent a nitrogen
phosphorus<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.210> potassium<00:00:31.300> in<00:00:32.020> that<00:00:32.260> worker

it's<00:00:33.010> always<00:00:33.430> in<00:00:33.580> that<00:00:33.610> order<00:00:33.940> those<00:00:34.210> three

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it's always in that order those three

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.330 
it's always in that order those three
nitrogen<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:37.680> responsible<00:00:38.680> mainly<00:00:39.040> for<00:00:39.220> the

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
plant so touch for us fertilizers as a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.880 
plant so touch for us fertilizers as a
general<00:01:05.890> rule<00:01:05.920> are<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.119> rough<00:01:08.020> ratio<00:01:08.649> of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
general rule are in a rough ratio of

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.990 
general rule are in a rough ratio of
about<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.610> three<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.440> one<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.950> two<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.550> meaning

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
about a three to one to two so meaning

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.790 
about a three to one to two so meaning
that<00:01:13.509> there's<00:01:13.750> about<00:01:13.840> three<00:01:14.200> times<00:01:14.440> as<00:01:14.619> much

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
that there's about three times as much

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.980 
that there's about three times as much
nitrogen<00:01:15.429> as<00:01:15.610> there<00:01:15.819> is<00:01:15.940> phosphorus<00:01:16.569> and

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
nitrogen as there is phosphorus and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.520 
nitrogen as there is phosphorus and
about<00:01:17.740> two<00:01:17.950> times<00:01:18.220> as<00:01:18.369> much<00:01:19.140> potassium<00:01:20.140> as

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
about two times as much potassium as

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.820 
about two times as much potassium as
phosphorus<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.810> always<00:01:22.959> important<00:01:23.770> to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
phosphorus now it's always important to

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.889 
phosphorus now it's always important to
start<00:01:23.979> with<00:01:24.069> a<00:01:24.190> soil<00:01:24.459> test<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:25.390> really<00:01:25.720> know

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
start with a soil test to really know

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.139 
start with a soil test to really know
what<00:01:26.200> your<00:01:26.770> turf<00:01:27.009> press<00:01:27.220> needs<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:27.910> again

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
what your turf press needs but again

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.499 
what your turf press needs but again
this<00:01:28.300> would<00:01:28.479> be<00:01:28.539> a<00:01:28.630> very<00:01:28.929> common<00:01:29.470> ratio<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
this would be a very common ratio and

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.589 
this would be a very common ratio and
it's<00:01:32.140> really<00:01:33.119> important<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.179> note<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.360> it's

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
it's really important to note that it's

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's really important to note that it's
about<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.899> ratio<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.470> not<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.619> sir<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.190> actual

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
about the ratio and not a sir the actual

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.260 
about the ratio and not a sir the actual
numbers<00:01:36.910> on<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.149> bag<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:38.130> example<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:40.060> might

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
numbers on the bag so example you might

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.139 
numbers on the bag so example you might
see<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:40.569> fertilizer<00:01:41.110> that's<00:01:41.500> 24<00:01:43.740> 312<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.940> might

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
see a fertilizer that's 24 312 you might

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.779 
see a fertilizer that's 24 312 you might
see<00:01:46.420> one<00:01:46.660> that's<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.080> twenty<00:01:47.410> four<00:01:48.209> five<00:01:49.739> eleven

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
see one that's a twenty four five eleven

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.040 
see one that's a twenty four five eleven
but<00:01:51.789> roughly<00:01:52.119> speaking<00:01:52.209> those<00:01:52.810> are<00:01:52.959> about

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
but roughly speaking those are about

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.050 
but roughly speaking those are about
them<00:01:53.349> that<00:01:53.500> three<00:01:53.800> one<00:01:53.979> two<00:01:54.160> ratio<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.640> very

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
them that three one two ratio a very

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.680 
them that three one two ratio a very
common<00:01:55.509> fertilizer<00:01:55.929> for<00:01:56.259> turf<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:58.149> we<00:01:58.599> were

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
common fertilizer for turf if we were

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.440 
common fertilizer for turf if we were
starting<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:59.110> new<00:01:59.319> lawn<00:01:59.649> though<00:02:00.009> or<00:02:00.450> starting

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
starting a new lawn though or starting

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.499 
starting a new lawn though or starting
sod<00:02:02.399> again<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:03.580> phosphorus<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.239> metal

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
sod again that phosphorus that metal

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.059 
sod again that phosphorus that metal
number<00:02:04.720> becomes<00:02:05.020> really<00:02:05.229> important<00:02:05.830> those

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
number becomes really important those

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.130 
number becomes really important those
seedlings<00:02:06.369> can't<00:02:06.880> reach<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.720> available

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
seedlings can't reach the available

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.469 
seedlings can't reach the available
phosphorus<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.860> soil<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.429> that's<00:02:10.209> where

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
phosphorus in the soil so that's where

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.919 
phosphorus in the soil so that's where
you<00:02:10.599> might

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
you might

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.289 
you might
see<00:02:11.549> something<00:02:12.549> like<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> 6<00:02:14.099> 2010<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.489> again

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
see something like a 6 2010 and again

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.670 
see something like a 6 2010 and again
maybe<00:02:16.569> it's<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:17.109> than<00:02:17.290> 6<00:02:18.780> 2020<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:20.349> not<00:02:20.500> so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
maybe it's more than 6 2020 it's not so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.110 
maybe it's more than 6 2020 it's not so
much<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.829> be<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.189> exact<00:02:21.549> numbers<00:02:21.939> but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
much to be about the exact numbers but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.690 
much to be about the exact numbers but
just<00:02:22.180> recognizing<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.170> will<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.439> see<00:02:23.709> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
just recognizing that will you see this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.670 
just recognizing that will you see this
Center<00:02:25.239> number<00:02:25.569> being<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:26.079> high<00:02:26.379> in

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
Center number being very high in

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.250 
Center number being very high in
comparison<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> other<00:02:27.639> two<00:02:27.969> that<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.019> most

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
comparison to the other two that is most

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.559 
comparison to the other two that is most
likely<00:02:29.469> meant<00:02:29.829> for<00:02:30.069> starting<00:02:30.609> a<00:02:30.730> new<00:02:30.760> lawn

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
likely meant for starting a new lawn

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.220 
likely meant for starting a new lawn
when<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.959> saw<00:02:33.299> landscape<00:02:34.299> ornamentals<00:02:34.959> on

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
when you saw landscape ornamentals on

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.599 
when you saw landscape ornamentals on
the<00:02:35.409> other<00:02:35.560> hand<00:02:35.859> typically<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.579> more

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
the other hand typically are more

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.129 
the other hand typically are more
balanced<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:37.629> their<00:02:38.319> ratio<00:02:38.590> would<00:02:39.099> be

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
balanced so their ratio would be

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.170 
balanced so their ratio would be
oftentimes<00:02:41.139> a<00:02:41.290> 1<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.769> 1<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:41.980> 1<00:02:42.159> equal<00:02:42.609> parts

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
oftentimes a 1 to 1 to 1 equal parts

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.470 
oftentimes a 1 to 1 to 1 equal parts
nitrogen<00:02:43.780> phosphorus<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.650> potassium<00:02:45.480> so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.229 
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium so
again<00:02:46.750> very<00:02:47.250> common<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> see<00:02:48.400> products<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
again very common to see products like a

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.670 
again very common to see products like a
triple<00:02:49.659> 15<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:52.200> triple<00:02:53.200> nine<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.469> so<00:02:56.469> while

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
triple 15 a triple nine and so while

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.959 
triple 15 a triple nine and so while
those<00:02:56.829> numbers<00:02:57.310> might<00:02:57.519> be<00:02:57.700> slightly

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
those numbers might be slightly

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.360 
those numbers might be slightly
different<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.840> ratio<00:02:59.349> is<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.680> same<00:03:00.040> that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
different the ratio is the same that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.759 
different the ratio is the same that
fertilizer<00:03:00.939> contains<00:03:01.389> equal<00:03:01.780> parts<00:03:02.109> of

nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and so

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.629 
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and so
