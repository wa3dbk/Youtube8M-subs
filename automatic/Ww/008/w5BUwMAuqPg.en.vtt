 Hi subscribers and / or the people who are 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.799
 watching the video from youtube looking 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.219
 the solution to the problem of how to put 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.790
 music on the playstation3 menu 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 it's very easy simple fast ok let's go 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.530
 to do a test so they can see how it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.950
 It's not a lie, we're going to put 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.620
 play 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.220
 let's hope it looks 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.050
 well we are listening to a one topic from 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.460
 the playstation speaker output 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.230
 normal TV as everyone knows for 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.680
 access the menu and all those things and 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.540
 press button ps 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.070
 us every time we press the button 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.960
 ps will not ask us to leave the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.270
 player or directly have the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.310
 music will go from the menu in this case 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.500
 thugs and so we do the tutorial well 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.890
 Well, the only thing we have to do is 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.780
 go to what are the adjustments to go down 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.360

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.430
 music setting 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.250
 and we will go down to frequency of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.010
 exit where if we are going to enter and we are going to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 put it on let's leave it at 48 or the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.690

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.010

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.930

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.760
