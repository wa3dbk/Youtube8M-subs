they had some other cards at the demo
station<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.439> none<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.619> them<00:01:37.770> had<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> back<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.729> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
station but none of them had a back so I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
station but none of them had a back so I
think<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.180> were<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.299> temporary<00:01:40.159> but<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
think they were just temporary but I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.480 
think they were just temporary but I
tried<00:01:42.270> them<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.110> work<00:01:43.490> with

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
tried them out and you just do work with

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
tried them out and you just do work with
the<00:01:44.700> AR<00:01:45.090> capabilities<00:01:45.780> while<00:01:46.110> using<00:01:46.409> kid

the AR capabilities while using kid

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.859

get<00:02:08.129> more<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.819> checked<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> pokédex

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
get more if you checked out the pokédex

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.309 
get more if you checked out the pokédex
3d<00:02:10.730> within<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> 3ds<00:02:12.180> area<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.720> Nintendo's

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
3d within the 3ds area of Nintendo's

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.860 
3d within the 3ds area of Nintendo's
booth<00:02:13.439> now<00:02:14.040> there<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.340> four<00:02:14.549> different

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
booth now there are four different

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.979 
booth now there are four different
markers<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.920> different<00:02:17.040> cards<00:02:17.519> then<00:02:18.359> my

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
markers here for different cards then my

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.479 
markers here for different cards then my
understanding<00:02:19.469> is<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.040> use<00:02:20.069> them<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
understanding is if you use them in the

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.179 
understanding is if you use them in the
pokédex<00:02:20.760> 3d<00:02:21.079> it'll<00:02:22.079> have<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.530> pokemon<00:02:22.980> pop

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
pokédex 3d it'll have that pokemon pop

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.949 
pokédex 3d it'll have that pokemon pop
up<00:02:23.400> out<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.790> card<00:02:23.999> I<00:02:24.150> tried<00:02:24.359> it<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.780> does

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
up out of the card I tried it it does

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.979 
up out of the card I tried it it does
work<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.439> it's<00:02:26.219> also<00:02:26.400> used<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.879> get<00:02:27.450> stickers

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
work and it's also used to get stickers

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.990 
work and it's also used to get stickers
I<00:02:28.260> don't<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.010> too<00:02:29.069> much<00:02:29.249> about<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.579> pokédex

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
I don't know too much about the pokédex

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
I don't know too much about the pokédex
3d<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.510> haven't<00:02:30.930> used<00:02:31.079> it<00:02:31.230> too<00:02:31.349> much<00:02:31.500> yet<00:02:31.739> but

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
3d I haven't used it too much yet but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.849 
3d I haven't used it too much yet but
I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.969> to<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.329> that<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.709> actually

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
I'm going to do that so you actually

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.520 
I'm going to do that so you actually
might<00:02:35.129> be<00:02:35.250> able<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> scan<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:36.409> right<00:02:37.409> off

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
might be able to scan these right off

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.599 
might be able to scan these right off
the<00:02:37.709> YouTube<00:02:38.040> video<00:02:38.189> here<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:40.159> use<00:02:41.159> them<00:02:41.400> in

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
the YouTube video here and use them in

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.330 
the YouTube video here and use them in
your<00:02:41.989> pokédex<00:02:42.989> 3d<00:02:43.079> like<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.829> said<00:02:44.010> there's<00:02:44.159> four

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
your pokédex 3d like I said there's four

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.970 
your pokédex 3d like I said there's four
different<00:02:44.370> ones<00:02:44.819> but<00:02:46.489> there<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.669> a<00:02:48.680> one<00:02:49.680> thing

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
different ones but there is a one thing

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.679 
different ones but there is a one thing
I<00:02:50.099> did<00:02:50.280> notice<00:02:50.310> about<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.269> these<00:02:51.359> cards

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
I did notice about two of these cards

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.899 
I did notice about two of these cards
now<00:02:52.409> these<00:02:52.590> two<00:02:52.799> cards<00:02:53.129> are<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.340> same<00:02:53.609> here

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
now these two cards are the same here

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.559 
now these two cards are the same here
but<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.469> card<00:02:55.859> has<00:02:56.129> rounded<00:02:56.879> edges<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.480> this

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
but this card has rounded edges in this

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
but this card has rounded edges in this
one<00:02:57.780> has<00:02:57.989> squared-off<00:02:58.560> edges<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
one has squared-off edges just on the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.429 
one has squared-off edges just on the
bottom<00:02:59.699> the<00:02:59.819> tops<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.239> still<00:03:00.449> rounded<00:03:00.810> so

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
bottom the tops are still rounded so

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.559 
bottom the tops are still rounded so
there's<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.739> slight<00:03:02.120> variation<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.359> and

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
there's a slight variation there and

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.289 
there's a slight variation there and
none<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.079> my<00:03:04.169> other<00:03:04.260> cards<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:04.949> the

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
none of my other cards have the

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
none of my other cards have the
squared-off<00:03:06.299> edges<00:03:06.329> here<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.500> don't<00:03:08.219> know

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
squared-off edges here so I don't know

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.069 
squared-off edges here so I don't know
if<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.519> other<00:03:08.549> cards<00:03:08.939> wherever<00:03:09.239> available<00:03:09.510> in

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
if the other cards wherever available in

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.780 
if the other cards wherever available in
the<00:03:10.169> squared-off<00:03:10.500> edges<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:11.099> some<00:03:11.579> crazy

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the squared-off edges but some crazy

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.390 
the squared-off edges but some crazy
collectors<00:03:12.659> might<00:03:12.959> want<00:03:13.919> to<00:03:14.010> know<00:03:14.099> things

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
collectors might want to know things

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.050 
collectors might want to know things
like<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:17.310> final<00:03:17.459> thing<00:03:17.639> being

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
like that and the final thing being

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.509 
like that and the final thing being
handed<00:03:18.449> out<00:03:18.540> by<00:03:18.750> Nintendo<00:03:19.290> were<00:03:19.590> pins<00:03:20.129> for

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
handed out by Nintendo were pins for

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.479 
handed out by Nintendo were pins for
various<00:03:21.000> 3ds<00:03:21.479> games<00:03:21.959> now<00:03:22.769> you'd<00:03:22.979> get<00:03:23.189> one<00:03:23.400> of

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
various 3ds games now you'd get one of

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.399 
various 3ds games now you'd get one of
these<00:03:23.579> pins<00:03:23.939> for<00:03:24.180> trying<00:03:24.449> out<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.930> game<00:03:25.139> its

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
these pins for trying out the game its

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.589 
these pins for trying out the game its
associated<00:03:25.949> with<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:26.879> Nintendo<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.389> being

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
associated with but Nintendo is being

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.629 
associated with but Nintendo is being
really<00:03:28.049> stingy<00:03:28.319> with<00:03:28.620> handing<00:03:28.949> these<00:03:29.069> out<00:03:29.340> I

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
really stingy with handing these out I

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.789 
really stingy with handing these out I
mean<00:03:30.299> many<00:03:30.479> times<00:03:30.750> they<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.169> say<00:03:31.319> they'd<00:03:31.530> run

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
mean many times they just say they'd run

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.280 
mean many times they just say they'd run
out<00:03:31.829> within<00:03:32.220> hours<00:03:32.639> later<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:33.090> yet<00:03:33.269> more<00:03:33.509> so

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
out within hours later that yet more so

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.689 
out within hours later that yet more so
I<00:03:34.319> don't<00:03:34.620> know<00:03:34.680> why<00:03:34.829> they're<00:03:35.040> being<00:03:35.189> so<00:03:35.310> stingy

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
I don't know why they're being so stingy

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.429 
I don't know why they're being so stingy
with<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.959> know<00:03:37.079> they<00:03:37.229> probably

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
with it because you know they probably

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.020 
with it because you know they probably
had<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.799> million<00:03:38.099> pins<00:03:38.459> when<00:03:38.639> they're<00:03:38.790> done

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
had a million pins when they're done

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.719 
had a million pins when they're done
anyway<00:03:39.479> but<00:03:40.049> here's<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.129> closer<00:03:41.310> look<00:03:41.489> at<00:03:41.639> all

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
anyway but here's a closer look at all

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.270 
anyway but here's a closer look at all
the<00:03:41.849> pins<00:03:42.120> hope<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.139> could<00:03:43.229> see<00:03:43.439> it<00:03:43.560> here<00:03:44.099> we

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the pins hope you could see it here we

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.349 
the pins hope you could see it here we
got<00:03:44.400> Mario<00:03:45.500> from<00:03:46.500> Super<00:03:46.560> Mario<00:03:46.829> 3ds<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:47.909> you

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
got Mario from Super Mario 3ds if you

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.089 
got Mario from Super Mario 3ds if you
look<00:03:48.540> closely<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.560> check<00:03:49.799> out<00:03:49.919> more

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
look closely you can check out more

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.249 
look closely you can check out more
pictures<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.549> ripped<00:03:50.790> ENCOM<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.720> might<00:03:52.139> be

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
pictures on ripped ENCOM it might be

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.599 
pictures on ripped ENCOM it might be
easier<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.799> see<00:03:53.009> there<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.489> look

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
easier to see there but if you look

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.069 
easier to see there but if you look
closely<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.359> can<00:03:54.419> see<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.870> there's<00:03:55.019> a

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
closely you can see that there's a
