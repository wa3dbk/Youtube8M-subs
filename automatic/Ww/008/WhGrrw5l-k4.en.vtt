00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.440
 You have been skating I have been between 12 and 13 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.619
 years skating 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.330

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.880

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.710
 opportunity to see what it means to 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.860
 you have the support of a big brand 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.560
 Well, the truth is that as a skater, 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.720
 feels good is not like a motivation anymore 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 that a brand supports you because it gives you 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.960
 up everything in any of any 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.180

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.130

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.980
