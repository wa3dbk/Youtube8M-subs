00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.130
 then he will leave a small 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.069
 explanation of a phone these Chinese 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.370
 a water plan 7 lion that they do 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.470
 promotion that can be submerged during 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.180
 the water inclusion of the 20 keeps us 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.240
 Up to 12 months in the water 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.210
 turned on and this phone does not turn on 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.920
 when I prove this continuity in the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.170
 ends of the battery 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.350
 then it marks me continuity from side to 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.350
 side 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.670
 between the positive and the negative and short 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.650
 to be able to review how well it is 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 completely assembled for it there are 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.000
 that remove the six screws that you have 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.040
 at the top and then remove two 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.820
 screws that have these two down here 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 gummies so finally have to 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.410
 remove the microphone the mic does not come 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.780
 Soldier since he brings here like a dough 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.390
 so that the water does not pass to do it 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.160
 waterproof then already when I have it that 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.159
 armed begins to analyze the circuits 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.900
 and I connect it to the source as we already know 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.110
 that has continuity from side to side to 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.960
 land of one is going to mark me a short if 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.390
 I try it with 3.8 volt ap 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 opponent the source is going to go ashore 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.200
 then then I connect it 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.240
 I connect it to the regulation source of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.750
 voltage that you have already shown in 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.800
 many videos and how low to where 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.040
 phone support the biggest this mini 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.520
 amps of short consumption when I 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.649
 I do that then I start to look and like 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.720
 the short is so pronounced I can not 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.830
 go up a lot voltage I'm just 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 going up just from voltage just 1.8 from 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.630
 one sends all that short to ground 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.369
 then as the voltage is little is going to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 heat less but if it is going to heat 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.039
 some area when I check what area 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.080
 heats more then he analyzed that this 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.720
 area near the connector of the 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.450
 battery is the one that warms the most is to 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.880
 the one that I'm going to start reviewing and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.610
 so let's see what we do to 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.250
 then giving the circuits I think 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.780
 that for example this circuit that I have here 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.819
 converted 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.290
 has continuity in one pizza in another 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.519
 taken to earth 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.290
 leaves you the earth and four earth 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.719
 four pizza ground in the commonly or 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.370
 normally it is that track two in the 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.170
 that is land, we always count 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.250
 counter- clockwise is the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.290
 guide 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 the first and the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.659
 second always going ashore is normal 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.220
 that this continuity the earth but the 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.379
 others none have to have 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.420
 continuity to ground but then there 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.700
 there is a problem but like this circuit 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.099
 the one that is heated is not heated 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.489
 first is this most likely the 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.939
 cut out six I'm going or I'm going to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.739
 distrusting one of that condenser I'll 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.090
 to apply plus and I'll raise it from a 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.090
 side I'll check yes 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.959
 from there I picked it up and I take it all 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.010
 the short one goes is the capacitor is 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.220
 it warmed up a little when I did the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.239
 test and already the short film that I had on 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.340
 side is gone 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.049
 it just shows me the normal charge and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.390
 discharge of all capacitors that 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.569
 are on the positive line now when 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.829
 I did not apply voltage 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.829
 and I give him power 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780
 turn on 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.959
 the phone was already turning 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.959
 in the battery 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.010
 we have already turned it on perfectly 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:54.780
 after he had a short between 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.060
 the positive negative line we have 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.310
 discovered that capacitor 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.920
 is the capacitor is a capacitor 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.079
 always a little big the most likely 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.540
 is that as I do not have plans I do not know what 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.610
 values ​​to be able to know the exact value 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.310
 I have to have the schematic and very 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.489
 I'm hardly going to get it, I guess 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.010
 which can be 220 micro farewell by 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.220
 the size however is simply 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.840
 something that I think would touch from one of the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.660
 you can change it to do 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.810
 exactly place the condenser 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.850
 same value so we have discovered many 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.530
 cases with the technique that we explain makes 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.600
 little in the channel for all of us 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.180
 they remain helpful arauca technical service 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.570
 professional in mobile telephony
