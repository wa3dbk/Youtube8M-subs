00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.269
 frenadeso

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.260
 I do not know why people are 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 sometime some missiles demarcate from floro 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.970
 to synchronize your nickname just do not 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.610
 it is not copied 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.140
 but then 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.420
 I have not had problems 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 then this one 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.840
 the church like 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 how to make your iphone current 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.160
 do not synchronize I love that connects you 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.920
 this kit on a screen with phoenix and what you cross did advance to this be 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460
 true music mimic not 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.580
 the only thing we have to do is against the aek foal old papers 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 who are positive we will give a click 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.110
 koke and and here he showed it to the east 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.710
 this screen 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.990
 the application tabs 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.360
 but no 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.610
 the music 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 the movies 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 and all that picture his training and all that 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 if you are this 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.990
 if you are based summary 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.700
 and come down here is the light 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.310
 / displaced 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.639
 they go down and say they come in with those options 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.869
 and here is the clinic that this delta that I say 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.079
 to see addicts to the driver this one acts as I have it 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.389
 with the popcorn 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.639
 if he took the little popcorn from me with the kilo of roasted chicken 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.349
 synchronized or forced to iTunes 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.099
 okey 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.420
 This is very important to keep in mind because if you are 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:31.819
 comments in a report 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.279
 there's still no funds to another to ips 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.589
 that are not yours are not two computers 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 automatically synchronize with that library 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.840
 and so with that courage in uteca lose 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.150
 everything they had 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.219
 of a still said 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.609
 or music 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.939
 applications and cpi photos too 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.669
 this from others the process came and kylie is the free space that I have 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.269
 and this is why you fear that this one 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.989
 the popcorn here to manage music and videos a big lie 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.950
 for clement that is unknown other there is for granted there is photo psoe fontao trol 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:08.759
 senator 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.979
 have another to itunes 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.329
 he has done is from his friend where he 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.919
 have musical no longer be 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.059
 I do not know if with that with that music and you have your music in the folder 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.329
 to activate 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.169
 you for example who attends and they do not 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.529
 nothing dantec to who suffers removes 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.849
 she legacy music 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.849
 how can you see text to your music inside the expo 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.689
 that has not been erased 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.779
 lacko in trusting it can be cleaned oaxaca to listen to copy it 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.349
 it's like a concrete proposal but to reproduce what can not be trusted 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.909
 as you can see 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.620
 is and will be a route that exists I think that the hawks are already quite 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.449
 in response to this is how they can make their pair 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.819
 perhaps to tones and without concession your iphone 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.960
 not in fact that brings us this 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.879
 in another com 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.599
 computers 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.869
 and so not lose music or photos or potash or videos or what 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.259
 another thing is when 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.169
 you and with nixon that have subtracted suharto 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.779
 oswalt with 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.799
 unmarked some error to the restaurant 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.749
 his mistake 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.870
 on the 16th we think it's good 104 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.059
 oab is that the finver that uses the mt is not compatible 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:32.809
 they have to make sure it's 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:34.360
 p that has a time 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.840
 of second-generation veal of third generation 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.199
 and that they know that is from that generation 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.360
 if you do not know how to present this 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.610
