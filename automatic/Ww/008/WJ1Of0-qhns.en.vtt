center<00:00:29.970> screen<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.320> Excel<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
center screen you can see Excel and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
center screen you can see Excel and
break<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.320> looking

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
break and you can see I'm just looking

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
break and you can see I'm just looking
for<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.950> oh<00:00:35.610> sorry<00:00:36.030> oh<00:00:36.149> poor<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.630> ice<00:00:36.960> cream

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
for that oh sorry oh poor on ice cream

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.410 
for that oh sorry oh poor on ice cream
yeah<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.969> want<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> keep<00:00:39.360> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
yeah so when you you want to keep that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
yeah so when you you want to keep that
ball<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.079> center<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> you'll<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.280> those

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
ball in the center and you'll see those

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360 
ball in the center and you'll see those
leaves<00:00:41.760> rotate<00:00:42.719> around<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.379> ball<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
leaves rotate around that ball if you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.000 
leaves rotate around that ball if you
accelerate<00:00:44.850> too<00:00:45.149> fast<00:00:45.420> you'll<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.110> your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
accelerate too fast you'll see it your

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
accelerate too fast you'll see it your
most<00:00:47.160> efficient<00:00:47.610> driving<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.090> keeping<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
most efficient driving is keeping the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.670 
most efficient driving is keeping the
ball<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> center<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.170> accelerate<00:00:49.410> too

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
ball in the center if you accelerate too

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.790 
ball in the center if you accelerate too
fast<00:00:49.950> it'll<00:00:50.700> go<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> an

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
fast it'll go up and turn a kind of an

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.220 
fast it'll go up and turn a kind of an
orange<00:00:53.039> yellow<00:00:53.309> color<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> similarly<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
orange yellow color and similarly if you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
orange yellow color and similarly if you
break<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> little<00:00:55.829> bit<00:00:55.920> too<00:00:56.039> fast<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
break a little bit too fast so it's just

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.580 
break a little bit too fast so it's just
telling<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.570> you're<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:57.840> driving<00:00:58.469> as

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
telling you that you're not driving as

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.580 
telling you that you're not driving as
efficiently<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.309> possible<00:01:00.109> in<00:01:01.109> governor<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
efficiently as possible in governor you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250 
efficiently as possible in governor you
can<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.100> power<00:01:02.579> flow<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.870> touch<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
can hit the power flow just touch the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.780 
can hit the power flow just touch the
screen<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> center<00:01:05.070> screen<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
screen on the center screen here and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.450 
screen on the center screen here and
that<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.659> show<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> quiet<00:01:08.760> yeah

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and that will show you the battery power

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
and that will show you the battery power
now<00:01:13.380> Hannah<00:01:13.710> yeah<00:01:14.240> yep<00:01:15.240> gorgeous<00:01:16.369> watch<00:01:17.369> out

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you're using battery power and that's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.870 
you're using battery power and that's
driving<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> motor<00:01:23.939> there<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:26.520> very

seamless when you transition to the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.920 
seamless when you transition to the
gasoline<00:01:35.850> engine<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> didn't<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.659> didn't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
gasoline engine I didn't I didn't

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.420 
gasoline engine I didn't I didn't
realize<00:01:37.320> when<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.829> may<00:01:37.950> express<00:01:38.250> way

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
realize when I was that may express way

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.760 
realize when I was that may express way
I'm<00:01:38.640> 96<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> does<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.350> different

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I'm 96 that it does it have different

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.219 
I'm 96 that it does it have different
gears<00:01:40.979> does<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> low<00:01:41.670> gear<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:43.049> does

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
gears does it have a low gear it does

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
gears does it have a low gear it does
have<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> low<00:01:43.590> gear<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.430> ya<00:01:45.060> next<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
have a low gear you can see ya next to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
have a low gear you can see ya next to
