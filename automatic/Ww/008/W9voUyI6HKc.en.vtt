00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
started to come out of dormancy I think

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.849 
started to come out of dormancy I think
that<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.810> about<00:00:24.960> 2<00:00:25.260> months<00:00:25.439> ago

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
that was about 2 months ago

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.380 
that was about 2 months ago
and<00:00:26.099> look<00:00:26.730> at<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.240> guy<00:00:27.720> he's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.800> big<00:00:29.369> boy<00:00:29.820> he

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
and look at this guy he's a big boy he

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.310 
and look at this guy he's a big boy he
has<00:00:30.929> such<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.590> fast<00:00:32.099> growth<00:00:32.730> rhythm<00:00:33.360> I'll<00:00:33.989> try

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
has such a fast growth rhythm I'll try

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.720 
has such a fast growth rhythm I'll try
to<00:00:34.380> show<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.780> exactly<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.320> happens<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.770> as

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to show you exactly what happens here as

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.540 
to show you exactly what happens here as
you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:39.239> he's<00:00:39.450> already<00:00:39.570> almost<00:00:40.550> mature

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you can see he's already almost mature

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
you can see he's already almost mature
but<00:00:42.420> he's<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:42.809> mature<00:00:42.899> yet<00:00:43.110> he<00:00:43.440> still<00:00:43.680> has

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
but he's not mature yet he still has

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.660 
but he's not mature yet he still has
some<00:00:44.120> leaves<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.989> produce<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.010> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
some leaves to produce so I think this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
some leaves to produce so I think this
new<00:00:48.239> cane<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.170> suitable<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.010> bigger<00:00:50.219> than

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
new cane or suitable will be bigger than

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.590 
new cane or suitable will be bigger than
the<00:00:50.640> older<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.090> hopefully<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.129> will<00:00:53.129> show<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the older one hopefully I will show you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.560 
the older one hopefully I will show you
how<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.870> guy<00:00:55.079> looks<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.440> root<00:00:56.280> wise<00:00:56.610> there

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
how this guy looks like root wise there

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
how this guy looks like root wise there

such a big boy I'm very proud of him so
for<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> reason<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.150> never<00:01:15.270> let<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.720> dry<00:01:16.020> out

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
for this reason I never let it dry out

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.649 
for this reason I never let it dry out
actually<00:01:16.590> fertilize<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.909> once<00:01:18.150> every<00:01:18.450> week

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
actually fertilize it once every week

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.109 
actually fertilize it once every week
and<00:01:18.960> every<00:01:19.590> three<00:01:19.920> fertilized<00:01:20.580> waters

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and every three fertilized waters

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.990 
and every three fertilized waters
actually<00:01:21.630> give<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:22.100> both<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.430> clear

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
actually give them both of them clear

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually give them both of them clear
water<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> flush<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.159> salt<00:01:26.939> bill

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
water this is to flush out any salt bill

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.030 
water this is to flush out any salt bill
tops<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.799> mixture

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
tops because I do have them in a mixture

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
tops because I do have them in a mixture
with<00:01:29.430> sphagnum<00:01:29.820> Moss<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.420> speck<00:01:30.930> no<00:01:31.079> moss

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
with sphagnum Moss and speck no moss

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.410 
with sphagnum Moss and speck no moss
tends<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> keep<00:01:32.100> those<00:01:32.369> salts<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> longer

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
tends to keep those salts for a longer

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.050 
tends to keep those salts for a longer
period<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.759> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
period of time so actually don't really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
period of time so actually don't really
soak<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
soak them because they do have a lot of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730 
soak them because they do have a lot of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
switch to the bloom booster and I will

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
switch to the bloom booster and I will
continue<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> bloom<00:02:06.869> booster<00:02:07.259> until

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
continue to use the bloom booster until

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380 
continue to use the bloom booster until
the<00:02:07.950> circuit<00:02:08.310> will<00:02:08.459> produce<00:02:08.670> some<00:02:09.030> flowers

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the circuit will produce some flowers

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.229 
the circuit will produce some flowers
hopefully<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> millennium

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
hopefully now this is the millennium

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
this pot and it is producing some more

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.410 
this pot and it is producing some more
roots<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.540> he<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.900> looking<00:02:37.320> wonderful<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.160> well

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
hopefully he will have the same fate as

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
hopefully he will have the same fate as
this<00:02:42.570> one<00:02:42.810> when<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> received<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.740> already<00:02:43.920> this

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
this one when I received it already this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.950 
this one when I received it already this
one<00:02:44.490> was<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> big<00:02:44.880> boy<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.390> that's<00:02:45.660> why<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
one was a big boy so that's why the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.980 
one was a big boy so that's why the
difference<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.740> size<00:02:47.490> but<00:02:47.970> hopefully<00:02:48.390> they

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
difference in size but hopefully they

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.750 
difference in size but hopefully they
will<00:02:49.110> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.530> make<00:02:49.680> their<00:02:49.830> own<00:02:49.950> schedule<00:02:50.550> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
will kind of make their own schedule and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
will kind of make their own schedule and
start<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.270> grow<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> same<00:02:51.690> time<00:02:52.200> now<00:02:52.860> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
start to grow at the same time now I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.460 
start to grow at the same time now I
keep<00:02:53.310> these<00:02:53.610> orchids<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.240> my<00:02:54.390> eastern<00:02:55.170> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
keep these orchids in my eastern and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.220 
keep these orchids in my eastern and
southern<00:02:56.280> exposure<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
southern exposure so they get the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.290 
southern exposure so they get the
highest<00:02:58.440> amount<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:59.130> Lights<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> can

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
highest amount of Lights that I can

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.970 
highest amount of Lights that I can
provide<00:03:00.480> without<00:03:00.870> actually<00:03:01.350> burning<00:03:01.560> them

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
provide without actually burning them

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.310 
provide without actually burning them
and<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.940> seems<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.480> do<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.630> trick<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:04.020> them

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
and that seems to do the trick for them

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.070 
and that seems to do the trick for them
they<00:03:04.530> absolutely<00:03:04.770> love<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.390> yeah<00:03:07.050> I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
they absolutely love it and yeah I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.510 
they absolutely love it and yeah I
really<00:03:07.440> hope<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:07.860> will<00:03:07.980> get<00:03:08.130> some<00:03:08.310> blooms

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
really hope I will get some blooms

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.910 
really hope I will get some blooms
