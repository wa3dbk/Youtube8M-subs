 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.410
 this video test of evernote for ipad 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.900
 the famous annotation application 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 content synchronization between 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.200
 devices 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.640
 evernote is an application 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.110
 multiplatform that allows you to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.189
 synchronize between devices 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.090
 compatible with photo annotation texts 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.290
 memo lists, notes and notebooks 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.690
 then let's see how it works 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.610
 the application at the first access will come 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.570
 obviously asked the user to create 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.090
 an account 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.150
 just enter an email address 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.660
 confirm the reply email to have 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.790

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.010
 main application allows 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.710
 create quick access notes 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.329
 to the various notes to invite you to invite 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.860
 friends to use the same 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.110
 application to choose the version 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.070
 premium that with a monthly fee or 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.560
 annual 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.229
 allows us to get functions 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 and to access the settings 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.039
 on our profile to exit our 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.649
 profile 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.570
 if we want to enter with another account 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.340
 to carry out a search or a search 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.810
 manual synchronization 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.149
 then let's see how a new one is created 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.250
 note if we want to use a note of 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.110

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.369
 category tags such as in 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.300
 this video test application case here 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.000
 we have the body of the note in short 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.740
 and we can start writing ours 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.990

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.789
 formatting 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.380
 once the editing is finished we can 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.869
 add a reminder a photo or a 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.240

 specially from the reminder section is 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.420
 You can create reminders like ad 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.880
 example to which we write tests and choose 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.400
 a date and time to make us 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 advise from the list section instead is 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.860
 You can create a real one 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120
 list that acts like a single note 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.579
 which gives us the chance to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:46.769
 uncheck the contents of each note or not 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.569
 inserted or deleted will be performed 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.610
 an automatic synchronization but it is 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.220
 You can always do it by pressing 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.569
 this button in manual mode 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.390
 evernote to a powerful function of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.980
 research that allows us to search 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.989
 practically among the various notes i 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.390
 various contents the desired content 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.730
 from the notes section we can have one 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.500
 overview of all the notes 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.500
 created in this case we have the two 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 test notes we have created before 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.370
 always available the function of 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.950
 note search is a creation function 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.209
 quicker than another note while from here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.030
 we have available 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.340
 settings for managing notes 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.720
 then for sorting and for 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.550
 additional information from 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.010
 show while from here we have the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.310
 possibility to activate a 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.710
 tabbed view from here we can 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.710
 Finding your favorite notes is a reminder 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.590
 back on the main screen 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.440
 let's take a look at the notebooks 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.390
 at the moment I have only one notebook plus the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.410
 trash can still be renamed 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.450
 or eliminate and create others as well 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.120
 however, once a notebook is created it is 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.320
 easy to create a note or move it 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.320
 in the desired notebook 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.410
 the premium version we had 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.459
 mentioned before allows us to obtain 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.269
 additional functions at a cost of 5.49 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.430
 euros per month or 44.99 euros per year 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.850
 we will have the possibility to access more 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.210
 to our offline notes add a 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.370
 block with code extend the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.440
 ability to upload more documents 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.840
 large then up to one gig of notes per 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.720
 month activate search within 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.020
 documents view the old ones 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.180
 versions of a note to be able to use i 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.180
 shared notebooks and other features 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.919
 the application itself is very good 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.350
 application in the free version 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.250
 maybe you feel a little lack of 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.990
 some functionality but if we are 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.830
 used to using the application 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.870
 native of the notes on ios surely 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.620
 evernote seems much more complete 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.780
 even if it lacks immediacy speed 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.360
 as the native application 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.810
 thank you for following me to 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.810
