that and my other squad was also Syria
and<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.100> was<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.640> pacer<00:03:09.420> version<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.200> had<00:03:10.350> Muriel

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and it was a pacer version I had Muriel

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.170 
and it was a pacer version I had Muriel
l<00:03:11.820> shall<00:03:12.180> we<00:03:12.600> love<00:03:13.340> Cortini<00:03:14.340> oh<00:03:14.580> he's<00:03:14.940> not<00:03:15.150> that

l shall we love Cortini oh he's not that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.630 
l shall we love Cortini oh he's not that
pc<00:03:15.600> but<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.350> know<00:03:16.500> he's<00:03:16.830> faster<00:03:17.340> than<00:03:17.370> her

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
pc but you know he's faster than her

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.140 
pc but you know he's faster than her
Nana's<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:19.470> team<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.340> lot<00:03:20.910> more

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
Nana's and this team is a lot more

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.979 
Nana's and this team is a lot more
successful<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.100> milito<00:03:23.100> plays<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.600> much

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
successful and milito plays so much

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.259 
successful and milito plays so much
better<00:03:25.380> than<00:03:25.560> Muriel<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.280> think<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:26.970> just

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
better than Muriel I think it's just

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.910 
better than Muriel I think it's just
down<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.320> formation<00:03:29.180> um<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.930> could<00:03:31.650> not

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
down to the formation um the I could not

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.699 
down to the formation um the I could not
use<00:03:32.489> Muriel<00:03:33.060> space<00:03:33.420> at<00:03:33.630> all<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.140> mean<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.530> could

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
use Muriel space at all I mean I could

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.070 
use Muriel space at all I mean I could
use<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.100> at<00:03:35.160> some<00:03:35.430> point<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.970> it's<00:03:36.420> not<00:03:36.840> really

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
use it at some point but it's not really

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.800 
use it at some point but it's not really
effective<00:03:37.440> yeah<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.670> what<00:03:38.850> really<00:03:39.209> helped

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
effective yeah but what really helped

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.460 
effective yeah but what really helped
was<00:03:40.100> stats<00:03:41.100> like<00:03:41.600> maletas<00:03:42.600> positioning

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
was stats like maletas positioning

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.280 
was stats like maletas positioning
little<00:03:44.130> strength<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.840> general

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
little strength and just general

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.729 
little strength and just general
all-around<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.940> know<00:03:48.090> stats<00:03:49.019> all<00:03:49.440> round

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
all-around you know stats all round

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.009 
all-around you know stats all round
starts<00:03:50.220> um<00:03:50.489> well<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.420> was<00:03:51.510> actually<00:03:51.750> quite

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
starts um well I was actually quite

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.750 
starts um well I was actually quite
surprised<00:03:52.650> about<00:03:52.980> as<00:03:53.130> well<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:53.370> he's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
surprised about as well as he's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.330 
surprised about as well as he's
dribbling<00:03:54.180> he's<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:55.170> was<00:03:55.500> quite<00:03:55.920> good<00:03:56.220> as

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
dribbling he's really was quite good as

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.490 
dribbling he's really was quite good as
well<00:03:56.370> i<00:03:56.850> think<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.450> was<00:03:57.480> also<00:03:57.780> due<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.200> him

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
well i think it was also due to him

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.350 
well i think it was also due to him
being<00:03:58.530> strong<00:03:59.100> like<00:03:59.459> when<00:03:59.970> he's<00:04:00.090> dribbling

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
being strong like when he's dribbling

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.930 
being strong like when he's dribbling
and<00:04:00.810> he's<00:04:00.959> holding<00:04:01.140> off<00:04:01.489> defenders<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.519> can

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and he's holding off defenders that can

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.080 
and he's holding off defenders that can
work<00:04:03.690> well<00:04:04.110> very<00:04:04.799> well<00:04:05.100> together<00:04:06.470> anyways<00:04:07.470> um

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
work well very well together anyways um

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.690 
work well very well together anyways um
he's<00:04:09.090> heading<00:04:09.420> was<00:04:09.780> quite<00:04:10.230> good<00:04:10.590> as<00:04:10.739> well<00:04:10.769> he

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
he's heading was quite good as well he

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.430 
he's heading was quite good as well he
was<00:04:11.850> good<00:04:12.150> at<00:04:12.180> getting<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.840> headers<00:04:13.230> he

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
was good at getting to the headers he

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.700 
was good at getting to the headers he
didn't<00:04:13.680> finish

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
didn't finish

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.250 
didn't finish
all<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:15.010> head<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.430> quite<00:04:15.940> well<00:04:16.210> but<00:04:16.570> he

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
all the head is quite well but he

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.960 
all the head is quite well but he
finished<00:04:17.650> most<00:04:18.250> opposed<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.970> say<00:04:19.830> he's

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
finished most opposed to say he's

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.750 
finished most opposed to say he's
finishing<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.440> ridiculously<00:04:23.440> good<00:04:24.010> if<00:04:24.490> you're

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
finishing is ridiculously good if you're

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.600 
finishing is ridiculously good if you're
outside<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.540> box<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.990> them<00:04:26.140> and<00:04:26.380> my<00:04:26.890> space
