let's<00:00:16.920> open<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> box<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:17.970> take<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.120 
let's open up the box so you can take a

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.190 
let's open up the box so you can take a

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200

closer look so the the stainless-steel
dial<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.280> roughly<00:00:26.610> 45<00:00:27.510> millimeters<00:00:28.370> and

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
dial here is roughly 45 millimeters and

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.179 
dial here is roughly 45 millimeters and
its<00:00:29.700> thickness<00:00:29.940> is<00:00:30.180> about<00:00:30.330> 15<00:00:30.930> millimeters<00:00:31.530> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
its thickness is about 15 millimeters so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
its thickness is about 15 millimeters so
let's<00:00:32.369> pop<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:32.910> wrist<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.630> see

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
let's pop it on my wrist so you can see

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.590 
let's pop it on my wrist so you can see
it's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.470> decent<00:00:34.830> sized<00:00:35.040> watch<00:00:35.400> but<00:00:36.240> it<00:00:36.330> doesn't

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's a decent sized watch but it doesn't

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's a decent sized watch but it doesn't
actually<00:00:36.690> feel<00:00:37.110> too<00:00:37.380> heavy<00:00:37.560> or<00:00:37.920> chunky<00:00:38.400> would

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
actually feel too heavy or chunky would

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
actually feel too heavy or chunky would
work<00:00:39.329> well<00:00:39.570> under<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.870> dress<00:00:40.200> shirt<00:00:40.470> and<00:00:41.190> could

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
work well under a dress shirt and could

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
work well under a dress shirt and could
possibly<00:00:42.240> even<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.750> used<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> unisex<00:00:43.590> watch

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
possibly even be used as a unisex watch

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.880 
possibly even be used as a unisex watch
although<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.340> marketed<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:44.940> men's<00:00:45.210> watch

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
although it is marketed as a men's watch

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
although it is marketed as a men's watch
so<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:46.920> zoom<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.790> little

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
so let's zoom in so you can see a little

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.410 
so let's zoom in so you can see a little
bit<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.210> detail<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.810> face<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
bit more detail on the face here so the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
bit more detail on the face here so the
dial<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.380> in<00:00:52.470> two<00:00:52.770> tones<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.520> white

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
dial is actually in two tones of white

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
dial is actually in two tones of white
so<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> top<00:00:54.630> ring<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.170> minute

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so there's the top ring with minute

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
so there's the top ring with minute
markings<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.310> a<00:00:56.399> darker<00:00:56.970> shade<00:00:57.210> of

markings and it's a darker shade of
white<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.380> you've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> brighter

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
