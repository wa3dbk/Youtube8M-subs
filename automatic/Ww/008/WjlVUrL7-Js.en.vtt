comments<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.220> says<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.729> MIT<00:01:30.119> Institute<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
comments and says the MIT Institute and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.899 
comments and says the MIT Institute and
Fenway<00:01:31.950> Park<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.520> only<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:32.880> things

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
Fenway Park are really only two things

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.760 
Fenway Park are really only two things
I'd<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.479> excited<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.320> he's<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.710> even

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
I'd be excited about so he's not even

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310 
I'd be excited about so he's not even
that<00:01:35.009> hyped<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.670> location<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.229> my

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that hyped on this location now and my

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.300 
that hyped on this location now and my
team<00:01:37.530> would<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:37.979> cool<00:01:38.100> especially

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
team would be really cool especially

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
team would be really cool especially
because<00:01:38.640> they'll<00:01:38.850> fall<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.360> involved<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
because they'll fall or involved with it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
because they'll fall or involved with it
where<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> believe<00:01:40.680> their<00:01:40.860> manufacturing

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
where I believe their manufacturing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
where I believe their manufacturing
androids<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.780> what's<00:01:43.200> interesting<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
androids there but what's interesting is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.020 
androids there but what's interesting is
I<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.399> we'd<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.610> able<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:44.970> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
I don't even think we'd be able to go to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
I don't even think we'd be able to go to
Fenway<00:01:45.329> Park<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> fall<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
Fenway Park and fall for and if you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.080 
Fenway Park and fall for and if you
don't<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.100> what<00:01:47.220> Fenway<00:01:47.490> Park<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
don't know what Fenway Park is it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670 
don't know what Fenway Park is it's
basically<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> baseball<00:01:49.140> field<00:01:49.409> or

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
basically the the baseball field or

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.380 
basically the the baseball field or
stadium<00:01:50.220> whatever<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> want<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> call<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> for

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
stadium whatever you want to call it for

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.170 
stadium whatever you want to call it for
the<00:01:51.420> Boston<00:01:51.990> Red<00:01:52.020> Sox<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:54.000> think

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the Boston Red Sox and so I don't think

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.160 
the Boston Red Sox and so I don't think
we'd<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.360> able<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.990> look

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
we'd be able to go there because I look

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
we'd be able to go there because I look
at<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.470> out<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:55.979> games<00:01:56.219> watch<00:01:56.520> dogs<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
at like out of all games watch dogs and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.569 
at like out of all games watch dogs and
in<00:01:57.719> watch<00:01:57.930> dogs<00:01:58.200> you're<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.860> baseball

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
in watch dogs you're in a baseball

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
in watch dogs you're in a baseball
stadium<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.450> Chicago<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.890> give

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
stadium in Chicago but they don't give

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.170 
stadium in Chicago but they don't give
it<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> name<00:02:02.399> they're<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.700> allowed<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> give<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it a name they're not allowed to give it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.219 
it a name they're not allowed to give it
a<00:02:03.240> name<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:03.570> named<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.810> after<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> team

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
a name or named it after the team

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.600 
a name or named it after the team
because<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.560> copyright<00:02:04.860> issues<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
because like copyright issues so I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.310 
because like copyright issues so I
wonder<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:05.969> they<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.180> even<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.840> fall

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
wonder if they can even do that in fall

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
wonder if they can even do that in fall
for<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.799> model<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.670> Fenway<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
for like model it out of Fenway so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.270 
for like model it out of Fenway so
really<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.560> alan<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.890> saying<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
really this is alan is saying that

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.230 
really this is alan is saying that
technically<00:02:11.790> he's<00:02:11.970> only<00:02:12.090> excited<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.629> one

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
technically he's only excited for one

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.000 
technically he's only excited for one
and<00:02:13.570> we<00:02:13.870> wouldn't<00:02:14.080> even<00:02:14.140> be<00:02:14.290> able<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.620> visit

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and we wouldn't even be able to visit

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.350 
and we wouldn't even be able to visit
one<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> areas<00:02:15.580> he's<00:02:15.730> actually<00:02:15.880> excited

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
one of the areas he's actually excited

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.390 
one of the areas he's actually excited
for<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.590> location<00:02:17.710> we<00:02:18.160> all

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400

really<00:02:18.880> were<00:02:19.000> hoping<00:02:19.360> for

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
really were hoping for

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.350 
really were hoping for
let's<00:02:20.110> see<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:20.860> Barack<00:02:21.220> Obama<00:02:21.640> sounds

I've heard is that for uh New York is

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
I've heard is that for uh New York is
essentially<00:02:34.360> just<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.750> big<00:02:35.230> pothole<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.950> know

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
essentially just a big pothole you know

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.190 
essentially just a big pothole you know
it<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.580> got<00:02:36.760> hit<00:02:37.090> directly<00:02:37.270> with<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> new<00:02:38.020> and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
it just got hit directly with a new and

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.350 
it just got hit directly with a new and
it's<00:02:38.590> all<00:02:38.740> done<00:02:38.950> now<00:02:39.460> with<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.820> said<00:02:40.150> though

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
it's all done now with that said though

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.540 
it's all done now with that said though
is<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.990> very<00:02:41.170> well<00:02:41.380> possible<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.010> over<00:02:42.340> time

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
is it very well possible that over time

New<00:02:42.790> York<00:02:42.970> has<00:02:43.120> rebuilt<00:02:43.420> itself<00:02:43.870> into

New York has rebuilt itself into

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.630 
New York has rebuilt itself into
something<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.560> would<00:02:44.950> argue<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.580> is

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
something I would argue that that is

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.580 
something I would argue that that is
entirely<00:02:46.360> possible<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.960> I'd<00:02:47.080> love<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.350> see

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
entirely possible and I'd love to see

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.140 
entirely possible and I'd love to see
that<00:02:47.710> that's<00:02:48.040> why<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.640> future<00:02:48.970> I'm<00:02:49.090> sure

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
that that's why in the future I'm sure

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.820 
that that's why in the future I'm sure
one<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.750> episodes<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.320> thought<00:02:50.500> for<00:02:50.710> its

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
one of the episodes of thought for its

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.440 
one of the episodes of thought for its
potential<00:02:51.100> locations<00:02:51.700> will<00:02:52.060> without<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.330> doubt

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
potential locations will without a doubt

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.090 
potential locations will without a doubt
be<00:02:52.600> New<00:02:52.930> York<00:02:53.170> because<00:02:53.440> that's<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.710> very<00:02:53.830> well

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
be New York because that's a very well

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.220 
be New York because that's a very well
possible<00:02:54.610> setting<00:02:54.910> for<00:02:55.060> Fallout<00:02:55.330> 4<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.990> just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
possible setting for Fallout 4 it's just

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.410 
possible setting for Fallout 4 it's just
we<00:02:56.410> may<00:02:56.770> not<00:02:57.100> see<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.550> just<00:02:57.730> because<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.240> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
we may not see it just because of the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.090 
we may not see it just because of the
fallout<00:02:58.750> lore<00:02:58.900> but<00:02:59.320> like<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.560> said<00:02:59.770> over<00:02:59.920> time

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
fallout lore but like I said over time

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.710 
fallout lore but like I said over time
things<00:03:00.520> are<00:03:00.670> rebuilt<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.390> very<00:03:01.540> well

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
things are rebuilt it's very well

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.090 
things are rebuilt it's very well
possible<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.230> Bethesda<00:03:02.590> could<00:03:02.740> say<00:03:02.890> well

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
possible that Bethesda could say well

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.620 
possible that Bethesda could say well
