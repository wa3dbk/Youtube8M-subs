 wait for text if you saw it in the video 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.180

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.230

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.340
 that I bring you today is worth here we are already 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.869
 we've taken it all this I'm going 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.910
 over pushed everything so we're going to 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.880
 remove and out is worth today I bring you 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.890
 benefit with suspensive points 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.899
 it will be alternately in days 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.100
 I tried to do what I benefited 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.450
 with FC Barcelona base profit 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.220
 Milan benefit with a player in 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.420
 concrete and in this case I bring you a 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.190
 specific player worth is going to be 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.350
 different here you have it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.430
 I have already pushed enough but good 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.840
 is that these if you look left 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.710
 very much less this one left 21 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.800
 minutes 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.440
 the others are pretty not see that 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.510
 basically what I do 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.010
 is to see first of all you see all 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.680
 that sold of distinguishes sold more 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.740
 but I want to be deleting also bid 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.810
 current 450 good sold for 500 500 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.369
 almost all all to 500 more or less 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.170
 all the others to 500 the only thing that 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.479
 some of them passed to me you see here I have 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 more to sell already sold will be 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.869
 they sell quite well the truth this one does not 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 I have sold it I do not know is that it has few 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.100
 contracts or what but not good but already what 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.289
 I'm going to take it out because it's over already 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.460
 about two pages or three pages so 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.380
 I'll hope that now it's going to 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 finish and I'll put it back to the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.009
 sale since I'm going to take it out 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.780
 I do not know perfectly how people know 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.950
 leads to this price but yes that is 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.270
 true that they take it they take it 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 pretty good, it's basically from 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.979
 take it , push it, let's refresh it 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 a little bit now and here I will have 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.179
 another distinguishes what I'm going to put 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.830
 perfect so it's good and we're going to go here 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.490
 ok let's look for distinguishes is a 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.020
 gold central defense 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.490
 French 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 and the truth is that it's a good way to 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 work is you can take out a lot of coins 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.310
 it's also his 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 ostia no bundesliga no a barclays 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.729
 everton position central defense vale 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.409
 let's look at everything that comes in the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.709
 minimum purchase price is already worth 6 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.480
 you set for example 400 already there would be 400 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.420
 and there are some for example this I buy it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 that was in the 59th minute and by 500 already 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.230
 I 'm going to take it out I'm telling you seriously 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
 although good for 400 the truth that I have 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.150
 pushed a little higher than I 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.250
 like it's worth I just put it on sale to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.959
 500 this when I'm sure I can the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.900
 The price has varied and well you see there 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.700
 some that there are not many no 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:42.129
 there is to see a page two pages three 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:44.349
 pages 4 5 6 7 16 6 and 3 is worth six and 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.640
 three more cards or there are not many 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.140
 so people are also going to look for them 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.329
 those in good condition 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.040
 all these will get them all right 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.290
 these also here I think somebody what 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.000
 is doing no vouchers are different 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.829
 Good people, I'm going to put you 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.680
 500 to sell not and basically I do what 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.109
 what I do is the 300 price search 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.900
 bid and here you see them I'm not pushing them 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.989
 for 350 he would take a physical form 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.209
 and up to 350 truth that I already like 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.230
 I'm also going to search, I focus a lot 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.120
 in looking for those that are in good 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 conditions here you are seeing it not 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.720
 just bid for those who have nothing 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.520
 Well this is a special case 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.900
 because he has a sentinel 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960
 and I would also put contracts and 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.120
 outside since I have enough and I do not 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.560
 this worries so well here you see it 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.720
 ok I'm doing this basically that 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.490
 is to bid and the truth that then the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.440
 put to sell at 500 and I have sold them 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.440
 these morning in the morning from him 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.209
 Saturday or today and I have sold them 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.950
 equally to 500 several now be the 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.660
 I would sell sure so good 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.819
 basically this is the trade or it is worth 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.739
 look for a player that has about six 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.120
 pages or so and bid I do it with 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.010
 different I suppose you can do it with 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.450
 any other and the truth that seems 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.129
 no, but they are selling, although 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.620
 are not yours the cheapest the 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.730
 people for the state they are good at 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.970
 for example, I sold it with two 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.980
 contracts because I do not know they are getting very 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.500
 well this particular player is a 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.510
 very good player and has 73 rhythm 78 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.450
 of defense that is pretty good already 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.440
 that it was clear that it is from the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.150
 Yesterday's streaming is also worth all 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.860
 these days I'll explain it to you 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.780
 as trade or with these with silver in the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.160
 video of tomorrow or the other so I hope 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.430
 which I have also liked this guide 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.470
 trade or benefit with this case I distinguish 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.150
 that I'm going to make many more teams and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.220
 good as always the question of the end 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.710
 of the video today is today I tell you what 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.350
 you want me to try in the next trade to 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.030
 with ellipsis, you can 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.960
 leave a team you can leave me a 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.570
 specific player 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.520
 not put me why not 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.800
 put a player over 5000 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.510
 coins because I could not it could not 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.000
 make a good 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.770
 they have been given so many, so a 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.250
 player that is among the thousand coins 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.810
 two thousand as much would be ideal 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.790
 or you can put a player or if not a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.960
