royal oak michigan kyle rodin you said
how<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.080> i<00:00:22.439> use<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.039> concept<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.609> melodic<00:00:23.910> try

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
how can i use the concept of melodic try

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.599 
how can i use the concept of melodic try
a<00:00:24.240> substitution<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.470> improvising<00:00:26.039> I'd

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
a substitution in my improvising I'd

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.130 
a substitution in my improvising I'd
like<00:00:26.759> to<00:00:26.789> assume<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.570> has<00:00:27.630> something<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> do

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
like to assume this has something to do

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.630 
like to assume this has something to do
with<00:00:28.259> poor<00:00:28.529> families<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> substitution

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
with poor families and substitution

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
with poor families and substitution
which<00:00:29.820> I've<00:00:29.939> been<00:00:29.970> brushing<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.419> on<00:00:30.630> any

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
which I've been brushing up on any

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.420 
which I've been brushing up on any
knowledge<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> practical<00:00:32.279> application

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
knowledge on the practical application

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.190 
knowledge on the practical application
of<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.940> concept<00:00:33.000> would<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.870> much

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of this concept would be much

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.790 
of this concept would be much
appreciated<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> basically<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
appreciated so basically you know the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
appreciated so basically you know the
idea<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.580> that<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.880> can<00:00:39.150> substitute<00:00:39.660> out

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
idea is is that you can substitute out

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.170 
idea is is that you can substitute out
in<00:00:40.830> a<00:00:40.950> diatonic<00:00:41.340> sense<00:00:41.700> that's<00:00:41.910> using

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in a diatonic sense that's using

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
in a diatonic sense that's using
anything<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:42.900> key<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.080> happen<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
anything from the key you happen to be

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.680 
anything from the key you happen to be
working<00:00:43.650> with<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.550> basically<00:00:45.180> substitute

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
working with in in basically substitute

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.770 
working with in in basically substitute
out<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.100> anything<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
out you know anything you want but you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.030 
out you know anything you want but you
have<00:00:48.900> to<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.410> sure<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.890> it's

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
have to kind of make sure that it's

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.190 
have to kind of make sure that it's
focused<00:00:50.490> in<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> court<00:00:51.720> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> moment

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
focused in to the court of the moment

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.770 
focused in to the court of the moment
now<00:00:52.320> let<00:00:52.560> me<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.740> example<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.600> I'm<00:00:54.600> gonna

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
now let me an example of this I'm gonna

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.050 
now let me an example of this I'm gonna
give<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.990> an<00:00:55.080> E<00:00:55.200> major<00:00:55.700> just<00:00:56.700> fourth<00:00:56.910> position

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
give it an E major just fourth position

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.990 
give it an E major just fourth position
you<00:00:57.360> major<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.900> and<00:00:58.490> what<00:00:59.490> I'd<00:00:59.580> like<00:00:59.610> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you major in here and what I'd like to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.030 
you major in here and what I'd like to
get<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.870> about<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.740> all<00:01:01.830> is

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
get you to think about first of all is

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.759 
get you to think about first of all is
something<00:01:02.970> simple<00:01:03.360> just<00:01:03.510> relative<00:01:04.170> major<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
something simple just relative major and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
something simple just relative major and
minor<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> some

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
minor now this is the this is on some

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
minor now this is the this is on some
major<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.810> major<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.590> relative<00:01:07.950> minor<00:01:08.159> gets

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
major you major the relative minor gets

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.419 
major you major the relative minor gets
that<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.270> C<00:01:09.570> sharp<00:01:09.840> minor<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.219> can

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
that is C sharp minor now what you can

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.489 
that is C sharp minor now what you can
do<00:01:11.609> is<00:01:11.909> place<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.479> sharp<00:01:12.749> minor<00:01:12.960> either<00:01:13.289> the

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:13.499 
do is place the sharp minor either the

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:15.980 
do is place the sharp minor either the
Triad<00:01:13.859> or<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.609> minor<00:01:14.850> seventh<00:01:15.329> quality

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
Triad or the minor seventh quality

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.380 
Triad or the minor seventh quality
arpeggio<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:17.130> top<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.640> E<00:01:17.820> major

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
arpeggio over top of that E major

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.359 
arpeggio over top of that E major
Moreton<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.439> only<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.829> if<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
Moreton the only thing is if you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.649 
Moreton the only thing is if you
probably<00:01:20.579> want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> start<00:01:20.999> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.179> C<00:01:21.329> sharp

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
probably want to start on the C sharp

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.929 
probably want to start on the C sharp
unless<00:01:21.899> maybe<00:01:22.499> the<00:01:22.950> E<00:01:22.979> major<00:01:23.369> chord<00:01:23.609> is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
unless maybe the E major chord is

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.050 
unless maybe the E major chord is
happening<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> major<00:01:24.990> sins<00:01:25.819> not<00:01:26.819> like

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
happening to be a major sins not like

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.849 
happening to be a major sins not like
you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.390> warrant<00:01:27.719> it<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.289> otherwise<00:01:28.530> maybe

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
you know warrant it but otherwise maybe

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.319 
you know warrant it but otherwise maybe
start<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.189> something<00:01:29.399> that's<00:01:29.640> diatonic<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
start on something that's diatonic to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
start on something that's diatonic to
the<00:01:30.479> core<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.109> a<00:01:31.259> clean<00:01:31.499> prove<00:01:31.679> to<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the core that's a clean prove to the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.380 
the core that's a clean prove to the
poor<00:01:32.069> apartment<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.850> something<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.119> maybe

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
poor apartment so something like maybe

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.059 
poor apartment so something like maybe
the<00:01:33.509> B<00:01:33.659> would<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.109> nice<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.469> could<00:01:34.679> come<00:01:34.950> up

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
the B would be nice to I could come up

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.859 
the B would be nice to I could come up
being<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:37.429> I<00:01:38.429> ended<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> g-sharp<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:39.749> is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
being and I ended on a g-sharp which is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
being and I ended on a g-sharp which is
a<00:01:39.899> nice<00:01:40.229> note<00:01:40.499> because<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.039> E<00:01:41.310> major<00:01:41.549> chord

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
a nice note because the E major chord

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.419 
a nice note because the E major chord
actually<00:01:42.210> has<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> g-sharp<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.829> those<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
actually has a g-sharp in it so those of

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.649 
actually has a g-sharp in it so those of
you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.909> relative<00:01:45.240> major<00:01:45.359> minor

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you know the relative major minor

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359 
you know the relative major minor
principle<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.409> quite<00:01:46.530> nice<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
principle is something quite nice to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
principle is something quite nice to
work<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.450> another<00:01:48.749> thing<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.289> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
work with but another thing that you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
work with but another thing that you
could<00:01:49.469> look<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.189> off<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.459> third<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
could look at is going off the third of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
could look at is going off the third of
the<00:01:50.969> chord<00:01:51.240> without<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.659> fifth<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.109> court

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the chord without the fifth of the court

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.709 
the chord without the fifth of the court
if<00:01:52.679> it<00:01:52.859> understand<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.639> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.539> poor

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
if it understand is you know the poor

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.870 
if it understand is you know the poor
tones<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.079> all<00:01:55.170> related<00:01:55.319> so<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.609> off<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
tones are all related so if you off the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.550 
tones are all related so if you off the
third<00:01:57.119> you're<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.569> to<00:01:57.630> play<00:01:57.749> a<00:01:57.780> minor<00:01:58.109> type

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
third you're going to play a minor type

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080 
third you're going to play a minor type
of<00:01:58.679> arpeggios<00:01:58.950> inside<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.549> keep<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.880> off<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
of arpeggios inside to keep you off the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.569 
of arpeggios inside to keep you off the
15<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.600> play<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:00.810> type<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> major<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.189> let's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
15 and play some type of major so let's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910 
15 and play some type of major so let's
go<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.420> take<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.810> third<00:02:04.109> just<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.829> an

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
go and take the third just to do an

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.379 
go and take the third just to do an
example<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.279> that<00:02:05.340> real<00:02:05.609> quick<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.209> a<00:02:06.240> G

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
example of that real quick so in a G

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.990 
example of that real quick so in a G
major<00:02:06.600> sorry<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.499> a<00:02:07.770> major<00:02:07.979> port<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.640> G<00:02:08.789> sharp

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
major sorry in a a major port so G sharp

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.840 
major sorry in a a major port so G sharp
note<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> third<00:02:09.780> degree<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.289> cord<00:02:10.850> so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
note as a third degree of that cord so

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.899 
note as a third degree of that cord so
what<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.060> could<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.450> play<00:02:12.630> maybe<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.050> g-sharp

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
what we could do is play maybe a g-sharp

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.009 
what we could do is play maybe a g-sharp
because<00:02:14.909> member<00:02:15.090> has<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.269> be<00:02:15.360> minor<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
because member has to be minor so you

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.080 
because member has to be minor so you
play<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> g-sharp<00:02:16.709> minor<00:02:16.739> try<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.909> can<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
play a g-sharp minor try it you can you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.330 
play a g-sharp minor try it you can you
play

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
play

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.610 
play
G<00:02:18.489> sharp<00:02:18.700> minor<00:02:18.940> 7th<00:02:19.480> feelin<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> play<00:02:19.900> nice

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.790 

and<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.400> hook<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.440> know<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
and that's a hook in but you know the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.410 
and that's a hook in but you know the
thing<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.849> phrase<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
thing is is you have to phrase it and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.940 
thing is is you have to phrase it and
you<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.660> work<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.989> how<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.410> into<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
you have to work on how to get into the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.830 
you have to work on how to get into the
quality<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.519> cord<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.940> that's<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
quality of the cord that that's of the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.180 
quality of the cord that that's of the
moment<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:33.099> if<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.400> play<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:34.000> seventh<00:02:34.390> quality

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
moment now if you play a seventh quality

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.309 
moment now if you play a seventh quality
g-sharp<00:02:36.190> minor<00:02:36.220> seventh<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:38.049> you<00:02:38.140> wind

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

up<00:02:38.410> getting<00:02:38.709> against<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.370> e<00:02:39.910> major<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.569> you

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
up getting against the e major is you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.470 
up getting against the e major is you
adian<00:02:41.290> an<00:02:41.920> F<00:02:42.099> chart<00:02:42.129> phone<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.819> know<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.450> is

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
adian an F chart phone you know this is

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.160 
adian an F chart phone you know this is
70<00:02:44.049> 90<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:46.299> happens<00:02:46.599> is<00:02:46.720> kind<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.080> giving

70 90 so what happens is kind of giving

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.520 
70 90 so what happens is kind of giving
you<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.410> sound<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:48.730> an<00:02:48.849> E<00:02:48.970> major

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you a sound a little bit like an E major

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.490 
you a sound a little bit like an E major
add<00:02:50.530> 2<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.780> which<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.079> quite<00:02:53.200> an<00:02:53.319> interesting

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
add 2 but which is quite an interesting

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.990 
add 2 but which is quite an interesting
sound<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.040> even<00:02:54.099> end<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.579> note<00:02:54.790> no

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
sound you can even end on the note no

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.460 
sound you can even end on the note no
you<00:02:55.360> know<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.540> could<00:02:55.660> try<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.230> see<00:02:56.349> if<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
you know you could try it and see if the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.780 
you know you could try it and see if the
phrases<00:02:56.829> correctly<00:02:57.190> for<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> song<00:02:57.610> you're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
phrases correctly for the song you're

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.160 
phrases correctly for the song you're
working<00:02:58.090> within<00:02:58.239> but<00:02:58.510> remember<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> lost

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
working within but remember the lost

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.069 
working within but remember the lost
factors<00:02:59.650> tie<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.269> including<00:03:01.840> rhythm

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
factors tie in to this including rhythm

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.630 
factors tie in to this including rhythm
so<00:03:02.260> don't<00:03:02.560> forget<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.799> one<00:03:03.069> but<00:03:03.459> anyway

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
so don't forget that one but anyway

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.890 
so don't forget that one but anyway
that's<00:03:03.760> not<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.060> principle<00:03:04.450> works<00:03:04.569> i'm<00:03:04.780> just

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
that's not that principle works i'm just

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.819 
that's not that principle works i'm just
going<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.079> quickly<00:03:05.170> move<00:03:05.410> on<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.799> next

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
going to quickly move on to the next

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.559 
going to quickly move on to the next
question<00:03:06.010> i<00:03:06.400> chose<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.640> question<00:03:07.090> next<00:03:07.329> that's

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
question i chose a question next that's

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.119 
question i chose a question next that's
actually<00:03:08.019> quite<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.440> closely<00:03:08.620> related<00:03:09.010> to

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
actually quite so closely related to

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.729 
actually quite so closely related to
this<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:10.599> next<00:03:10.840> question<00:03:10.930> coming<00:03:11.379> up<00:03:11.530> here<00:03:11.680> is

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
this the next question coming up here is

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.170 
this the next question coming up here is

relationship<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.430> between<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.849> base<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
relationship is between the base and the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.509 
relationship is between the base and the
chords<00:03:16.840> played<00:03:17.170> by<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.650> keyboard<00:03:18.190> or<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
chords played by the keyboard or the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.910 
chords played by the keyboard or the
doors<00:03:18.970> are<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.450> guitar<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.680> says

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
doors are the guitar and I says

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440 
doors are the guitar and I says
everything<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.670> ask<00:03:21.819> is<00:03:22.000> because<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.269> was

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
everything I ask is because I was

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.789 
everything I ask is because I was
playing<00:03:22.660> along<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.139> bob<00:03:23.260> marley<00:03:23.590> tune

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
playing along with the bob marley tune

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.800 
playing along with the bob marley tune
heathen<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.340> i<00:03:24.790> read<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.150> tap<00:03:25.359> somewhere<00:03:25.690> that

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
heathen and i read a tap somewhere that

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.410 
heathen and i read a tap somewhere that
put<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.170> core<00:03:26.350> changes<00:03:26.709> as<00:03:26.889> a<00:03:27.130> minor<00:03:27.609> C<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.239> G

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
put the core changes as a minor C and G

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.420 
put the core changes as a minor C and G
which<00:03:28.930> sounds<00:03:29.290> right<00:03:29.500> but<00:03:29.530> then<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.069> heard<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
which sounds right but then I heard the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.270 
which sounds right but then I heard the
song<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:31.139> Shabba<00:03:32.139> Ranks<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.769> heart<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.069> lion

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
song of Shabba Ranks a heart of a lion

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.370 
song of Shabba Ranks a heart of a lion
and<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:34.000> didn't<00:03:34.450> sound<00:03:34.569> right<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.019> i<00:03:35.049> swapped

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
and it didn't sound right so i swapped

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.339 
and it didn't sound right so i swapped
the<00:03:36.010> g<00:03:36.220> with<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> B<00:03:36.940> minor<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.599> that's<00:03:38.079> not<00:03:38.260> it

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
the g with a B minor and that's not it

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.129 
the g with a B minor and that's not it
right<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.709> his<00:03:38.829> question<00:03:39.190> here<00:03:39.400> is<00:03:39.430> however

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
right and his question here is however

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.890 
right and his question here is however
how<00:03:41.139> can<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.920> same<00:03:42.280> baseline<00:03:42.849> have<00:03:43.480> different

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
how can the same baseline have different

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.259 
how can the same baseline have different
chords<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.799> accompany<00:03:45.310> them<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.150> idea

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
chords to accompany them so the idea

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.409 
chords to accompany them so the idea
really<00:03:46.720> is<00:03:46.870> all<00:03:47.560> these<00:03:48.010> core<00:03:48.519> these<00:03:48.940> chords

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
really is all these core these chords

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.539 
really is all these core these chords
the<00:03:49.630> g<00:03:50.049> major<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.500> B<00:03:50.620> minor<00:03:50.859> are<00:03:51.160> actually

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
the g major in the B minor are actually

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.339 
the g major in the B minor are actually
related<00:03:51.669> now<00:03:52.239> let<00:03:52.419> me<00:03:52.450> give<00:03:52.599> you<00:03:52.690> an<00:03:52.780> idea<00:03:53.019> this

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
related now let me give you an idea this

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.890 
related now let me give you an idea this
because<00:03:53.769> chords<00:03:54.609> are<00:03:54.910> constructed<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:55.720> third

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
because chords are constructed in third

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.839 
because chords are constructed in third
interval<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.470> if<00:03:56.560> we<00:03:56.650> took<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.859> G<00:03:57.040> chord<00:03:57.280> you

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
interval so if we took a G chord you

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.699 
interval so if we took a G chord you
went<00:03:58.090> out<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.180> third<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.569> get<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.810> Abby<00:03:58.989> mmm<00:03:59.590> you

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
went out a third you get to Abby mmm you

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.020 
went out a third you get to Abby mmm you
want<00:03:59.859> a<00:03:59.889> third<00:04:00.069> from<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.310> bead<00:04:00.489> get<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.849> deep

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
want a third from the bead get to a deep

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.430 
want a third from the bead get to a deep
in<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.599> key<00:04:01.720> if<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.840> want<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.079> third<00:04:02.260> from

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
in the key if you want a third from

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.780 
in the key if you want a third from
there<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.650> get<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.859> an<00:04:02.919> f-sharp<00:04:03.069> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
there you get to an f-sharp and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.699 
there you get to an f-sharp and
basically<00:04:04.510> what<00:04:04.690> happens<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.109> your<00:04:05.290> stocking

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
basically what happens is your stocking

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.250 
basically what happens is your stocking
and<00:04:05.829> thurs<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.340> if<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:07.120> started<00:04:07.630> on<00:04:07.750> cheese<00:04:07.989> you

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
and thurs so if I started on cheese you

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.870 
and thurs so if I started on cheese you
know<00:04:08.349> I<00:04:08.380> get<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.859> me<00:04:09.069> note<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.549> Dino

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
know I get the me note and the Dino

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.360 
know I get the me note and the Dino
coming<00:04:10.299> up<00:04:10.389> but<00:04:10.540> hey<00:04:10.720> if<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.019> start<00:04:11.349> on<00:04:11.470> be<00:04:11.709> guess

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
coming up but hey if I start on be guess

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.580 
coming up but hey if I start on be guess
what<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.579> next<00:04:12.790> note<00:04:12.970> is<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:13.510> D<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.109> then<00:04:14.500> if

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
what the next note is it's D and then if

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.229 
what the next note is it's D and then if
you<00:04:14.650> go<00:04:14.769> from<00:04:14.919> there<00:04:15.190> cuz<00:04:15.400> member<00:04:15.639> ID<00:04:15.760> I

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
you go from there cuz member ID I

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.690 
you go from there cuz member ID I
started<00:04:16.810> initially<00:04:17.019> off<00:04:17.500> g<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.039> went<00:04:18.250> G<00:04:18.459> B<00:04:18.669> D

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
started initially off g and I went G B D

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.390 
started initially off g and I went G B D
F<00:04:18.910> sharp<00:04:19.359> if<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.079> start<00:04:20.349> on<00:04:20.470> be<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:21.160> know<00:04:21.250> my

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
F sharp if I start on be you know my

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.279 
F sharp if I start on be you know my
root<00:04:21.639> third<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.030> fifth<00:04:22.270> come<00:04:22.660> from<00:04:22.870> be<00:04:23.020> go<00:04:23.229> to

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
root third and fifth come from be go to

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.520 
root third and fifth come from be go to
D<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.770> then<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.889> hit<00:04:24.099> enough

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
D and then I hit enough

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.770 
D and then I hit enough
as<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.889> fifth<00:04:25.280> away<00:04:25.580> from<00:04:25.820> be<00:04:25.970> starting<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.450> see

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
as a fifth away from be starting to see

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.650 
as a fifth away from be starting to see
the<00:04:26.810> correlation<00:04:27.320> here<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.160> all<00:04:28.250> interrelated

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
the correlation here so all interrelated

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.080 
the correlation here so all interrelated
so<00:04:29.660> that's<00:04:30.050> why<00:04:30.470> they<00:04:31.130> actually<00:04:31.670> function

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
so that's why they actually function

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.120 
so that's why they actually function
against<00:04:32.389> one<00:04:32.570> others<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.800> know<00:04:33.889> basically

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
against one others is you know basically

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.430 
against one others is you know basically
the<00:04:34.430> same<00:04:34.610> type<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:34.970> court<00:04:35.540> construction<00:04:35.870> but

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
the same type of court construction but

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.840 
the same type of court construction but
coming<00:04:36.680> off<00:04:36.800> different<00:04:37.190> notes<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:37.639> I<00:04:37.730> were

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
coming off different notes and if I were

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.180 
coming off different notes and if I were
to<00:04:37.940> start<00:04:38.150> off<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.690> D<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.290> begin<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:40.010> poor

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
to start off of the D and begin a poor

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.100 
to start off of the D and begin a poor
construction<00:04:40.430> off<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.000> would<00:04:41.240> go<00:04:41.389> from<00:04:41.840> D

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
construction off that I would go from D

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.050 
construction off that I would go from D
to<00:04:42.139> F<00:04:42.320> sharp<00:04:42.680> as<00:04:42.889> a<00:04:42.919> major<00:04:43.220> third<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.850> D<00:04:44.000> is

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
to F sharp as a major third so the D is

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.450 
to F sharp as a major third so the D is
giving<00:04:44.870> me<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:44.960> major<00:04:45.200> quality<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.100> next<00:04:46.340> up

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
giving me a major quality the next up

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
started from which was that root of G i

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.540 
started from which was that root of G i
would<00:04:52.790> get<00:04:52.970> some<00:04:53.600> type<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:53.990> g-major<00:04:54.650> at<00:04:55.220> nine

it's<00:05:47.330> just<00:05:47.390> basically<00:05:47.690> d<00:05:48.289> and<00:05:48.770> that<00:05:48.919> goes<00:05:49.070> up

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
it's just basically d and that goes up

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.000 
it's just basically d and that goes up
into<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:50.000> G<00:05:50.419> and<00:05:50.750> then<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.080> goes<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.200> fade<00:05:51.500> and

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
into a G and then it goes a fade and

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.969 
into a G and then it goes a fade and
comes<00:05:52.220> back<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:52.610> G<00:05:52.970> again<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.740> basically<00:05:54.740> in

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
comes back to G again and basically in

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.130 
comes back to G again and basically in
red<00:05:55.310> red<00:05:55.460> wine<00:05:55.490> it's<00:05:56.300> obvious<00:05:56.660> desk<00:05:56.930> like

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
red red wine it's obvious desk like

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
chord progression is just a 145 now what

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.560 
chord progression is just a 145 now what
happens<00:06:01.880> in<00:06:01.970> a<00:06:02.000> to<00:06:02.150> note<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.390> kind<00:06:02.510> of

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
happens in a to note is kind of

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.820 
happens in a to note is kind of
interesting<00:06:02.720> is<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.080> guitars<00:06:03.380> playing<00:06:03.620> that

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
interesting is the guitars playing that

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.690 
interesting is the guitars playing that
but<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.400> base<00:06:04.610> actually<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.210> plays<00:06:05.539> a<00:06:06.370> 120<00:06:07.370> for

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
but the base actually it plays a 120 for

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.960 
but the base actually it plays a 120 for
and<00:06:07.990> then<00:06:08.990> equals<00:06:09.229> food<00:06:09.320> tube<00:06:09.669> and<00:06:10.669> then<00:06:10.760> comes

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
and then equals food tube and then comes

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.719 
and then equals food tube and then comes
around<00:06:11.150> to<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:11.270> five<00:06:11.710> so<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.800> resolution<00:06:13.550> on

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
around to a five so the resolution on

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.090 
around to a five so the resolution on
the<00:06:14.150> base<00:06:14.330> is<00:06:14.990> actually<00:06:15.530> different<00:06:15.680> than<00:06:16.010> the

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
the base is actually different than the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.400
