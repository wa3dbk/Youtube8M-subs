00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 yes hello and welcome people 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 the next part of snowdowne 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 showdown 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 I mean it is called or look over it 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 and showdown showdown times that does not say that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 yes, right at the beginning as she insists 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.630
 Payed attention that we decided the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.310
 to take dialects times look these 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
 supports the other side this time 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 not if he prefers his side exactly and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 my cuban one page is video and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 in contrast to the predecessor are the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.170
 I think that's pretty interesting 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 Watch if it does exactly like that now 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 can like our opponents in the last game 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.920
 but they also only paint colors 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.640
 the problem is just mega blatant tower 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.989
 potential built more realistic way 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:49.770
 and he tries out direct German 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 just like I bring him here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:04.680
 relatively because a second learn so why 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.640
 you can the word to the head 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 because of the stairs okay 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:40.430
 There are also the stairs like our plan 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:40.430
 it is either longer in there 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:55.440
 the clou is waiting for the thing here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:56.520
 just go out and opfers follow me 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.229
 I had not moved at all now 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.729
 I have to drive so I think so 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.539
 This time I hope that this time 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.539
 are not challengers 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:21.530
 does not heal having one too few times 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.530
 Watching pm we start stop 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.910
 So for the human being I'll stop 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.650
 not all okay with two but just nice 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.160
 we have the time on our 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.160
 side, I think 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.370
 what on the 56th I think one now 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.480
 Trap passed 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.030
 that's just here, too 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:03.000
 reside in this area as a 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.000
 little bit like the media 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.050
 what's the poison what is that? 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.450
 yes, yes 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:51.050
 oh my god did I already say 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:04:02.690
 can jump around a lot longer 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:07.300
 rebecca kopp okay it's nice 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.300
 thing old butterfly 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.209
 that was new should there be too deep 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.889
 gone the situation well let's say 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.239
 it is the next part depending on 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.229
 how much we were I just take it 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.030
 spontaneously a few expenses are easy 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.590
 mega mood makes it easy to try it too 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.590
 time out and
