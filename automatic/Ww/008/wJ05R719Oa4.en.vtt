00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.500
 Well, hello everyone Manerrea johan 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.789
 good all of us who are in the 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.380
 small and good here we have the famous 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:23.310
 332 3 2 well we have we have two 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.260
 LED bulbs here do not focus here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.699
 we have two LED bulbs these two 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.320
 LED bulbs 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.760
 they have given us a result that later 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.910
 we will check 110 volts and good 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.329
 then say good peaks peaks to 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.109
 23 tell you that it came down a little less than a 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.929
 milan to each bulb and they are working 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.799
 at 50 percent since they have 110 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:54.519
 volts the output are 220 then here 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:57.459
 what there is is a voltage reduction and 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.459
 does not translate it amperage good these 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:02.559
 coils have not been used at all 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.869
 that are not waking we would have to 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.799
 have two coils but I saw subsidiaries 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.170
 then we would connect is to the entrance 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.600
 and is also the one between we would connect 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.510
 with this one and we would leave the exit but 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.270
 here would be another coil and another coil of 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.940
 subsidiary let's say then this cable 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.800
 here like and this one here we would do it to 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.070
 this 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.620
 this let's say this output we could 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.300
 look to plug in the output of the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.910
 bomb and good and then we would have 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.860
 double double induction then yes that 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.330
 it would work but this already already 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.670
 because now clarify and prove 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.610
 always always static is everything not 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.840
 he has nothing or nothing but nothing with his finger 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 we lower the voltage to zero and here here 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.550
 let's say we have 89 but it's simple simple 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.520
 simple static but when you do it very 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.710
 difficult already changes the situation good 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.370
 for the andreu test here I put 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.160
 another led bulb so you can see 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.800
 the tester works, it's not bad 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.500
 and here there is no end of anything is all 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.090
 Of course, because I also like things 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.710
 clear that I've always been many years 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.070
 stretching this energy 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.140
 so focus here and you will see now 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.720
 when I plug in the little bulb 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.440
 directly to the network 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:34.290
 there we have been uploaded to 24 24 good 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.070
 Well then, here it is clear that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 we have the let's say the pacifier of the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:45.150
 bulb what he touches and good and then 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.030
 these being at 110 is 50% 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 Well, let's look at the good tension 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.770
 you see this that is 23 23 that is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.510
 insignificant the expense that has 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.150
 we remove it from here 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.150
 ok and now we will put 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.190
 we will put 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.280
 to measure the tension 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.760
 and you will see that there we have 110 volts 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.760
 yes 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.680
 and now we take attention from here of 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.680
 the exit 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.010
 two 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.010
 such 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.740
 there are people that we have the amperage there 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.400
 what to put alternate voltage 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.980
 because it's alternating current and here if 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.980
 will mark us 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.340
 108 for 109 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.909
 there are times that it varies 109-110 depending 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.690
 how is it in the current and good 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:03.560
 Well, you see, here we have 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:08.240
 50% to each bulb which if we 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:12.620
 spend one we spend 24 more or less to 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.519
 each one goes 12 12 thousand jams 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.640
 that we are at 110 that is half of 220 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.730
 ok you can think that these works fairy 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.160
 Well, it's done a little 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.170
 he lacks the pepper he needs the 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.240
 knowledge here there is nothing and in addition 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.590
 of this if we make it subsidiary we can 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.930
 add even more output voltage and 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.030
 good and it comes with two light bulbs 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.250
 lit we have to go up the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.510
 voltage and little by little we will improve 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.270
 the efficiency then let's go we're 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.020
 above generating a free energy 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.390
 of the bestial of dark matter as 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.560
 says andreu that is why we go for the good 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.170
 path 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.800
 I hope the video will serve to help 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:06.170
 many people and good and nothing because up 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.780
 soon and we will do more more sobrasadas 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.050
 much more efficient and good and 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.440
 we will continue investigating and well then that 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.200
 tell everyone that a little hello and even 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.770
 soon it's worth 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.770
 bye
