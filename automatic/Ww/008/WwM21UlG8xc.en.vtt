but it's not gonna add a lot of weight

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.750 
but it's not gonna add a lot of weight

I can feel the padding and that's what's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.770 
I can feel the padding and that's what's
what's<00:00:58.160> important<00:00:58.640> with<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.090> technology

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780

actually<00:01:17.900> hand-painted<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:18.830> one<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:19.340> did

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
actually hand-painted this one so I did

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.570 
actually hand-painted this one so I did
hand<00:01:19.909> dry<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.330> if<00:01:20.630> we're<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.460> creative<00:01:22.460> we

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
hand dry that if we're so creative we

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.840 
hand dry that if we're so creative we
could<00:01:22.729> do<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.560> okay<00:01:24.560> how<00:01:24.740> do<00:01:24.799> we<00:01:24.890> start<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
could do that okay how do we start the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.179 
could do that okay how do we start the
first<00:01:26.240> thing<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.689> do<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.619> piece<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:28.040> felt

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
first thing to do is get a piece of felt

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.830 
first thing to do is get a piece of felt
that<00:01:28.549> gives<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:28.970> little<00:01:29.330> bit<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.630> padding

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
that gives it a little bit of padding

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.710 
that gives it a little bit of padding
and<00:01:30.439> makes<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.400> cozy<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.970> there's<00:01:32.509> different

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and makes it cozy and there's different

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.569 
and makes it cozy and there's different
thicknesses<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.680> could<00:01:34.040> make<00:01:34.549> your

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
thicknesses so you could make your

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.370 
thicknesses so you could make your
decision<00:01:35.240> based<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.619> weight<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
decision based on the weight of the the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.510 
decision based on the weight of the the
stabilizers<00:01:39.380> right<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.040> mean<00:01:40.189> this<00:01:40.280> isn't

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
stabilizers right and I mean this isn't

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.130 
stabilizers right and I mean this isn't
going<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.850> protect<00:01:41.150> it<00:01:41.299> if<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.659> drop<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.079> on

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
going to protect it if you drop it on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.139 
going to protect it if you drop it on
the<00:01:42.290> ground<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:43.189> going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.460> keep<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
the ground but it's going to keep the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.880 
the ground but it's going to keep the
screen<00:01:44.450> from<00:01:44.659> getting<00:01:44.930> scratched<00:01:45.259> up<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.740> your

tablet you could probably even do a
laptop<00:01:58.280> case<00:01:58.549> actually<00:01:58.820> with<00:01:59.509> this<00:01:59.659> same

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
that to just very close to the stitching

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.070 
that to just very close to the stitching
right<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.850> will<00:03:00.120> give<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.959> right

makes sense now

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.400 
makes sense now
uh-huh<00:03:05.180> once<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.299> have<00:03:06.420> both<00:03:06.630> pieces<00:03:06.900> cut<00:03:07.380> out

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
uh-huh once you have both pieces cut out

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.370 
uh-huh once you have both pieces cut out
you'll<00:03:08.100> want<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> turn<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
you'll want to turn this so that the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.720 
you'll want to turn this so that the
right<00:03:10.560> sides<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.160> facing<00:03:13.160> out<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:17.579> is

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
right sides are facing out and this is

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.160 
right sides are facing out and this is
always<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.239> trickiest<00:03:18.570> part<00:03:18.900> when<00:03:19.049> you're

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
always the trickiest part when you're

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.460 
always the trickiest part when you're
lining<00:03:19.560> something<00:03:20.930> because<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.049> don't<00:03:22.260> want

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
to have your raw edges on the inside

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.920 
to have your raw edges on the inside
lining<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.459> way<00:03:26.609> you<00:03:26.670> put<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.209> into<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
lining so the way you put this into the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.310 
lining so the way you put this into the
lining<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.709> take<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.070> lining<00:03:29.579> on<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
lining is you take the lining on the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.569 
lining is you take the lining on the
outside<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:33.299> put<00:03:33.600> oh<00:03:33.930> use<00:03:34.890> your<00:03:35.070> hand<00:03:35.370> uh-huh

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
that technique then you don't have a

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.910 
that technique then you don't have a
rough<00:04:45.360> edge<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:45.840> looks<00:04:46.080> nice<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.350> finished

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
rough edge it looks nice and finished

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.400 
rough edge it looks nice and finished
and<00:04:47.130> professional<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.630> then<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.900> don't<00:04:49.260> get

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
and professional and then we don't get

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.230 
and professional and then we don't get
closure<00:04:49.710> well<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.190> still<00:04:50.460> have<00:04:50.640> an<00:04:50.790> opening

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
closure well you still have an opening

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.570 
closure well you still have an opening
you<00:04:51.600> know<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.780> want<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.110> get<00:04:52.560> right<00:04:52.860> uh-huh

just<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.210> fit<00:04:57.390> clean<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:57.960> up<00:04:59.150> then<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.270> want

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
just to fit clean that up then you want

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.320 
just to fit clean that up then you want
to<00:05:00.480> make<00:05:00.600> a<00:05:00.630> closure<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:02.550> just<00:05:02.850> cut<00:05:03.090> a

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
to make a closure and I just cut a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.290 
to make a closure and I just cut a
little<00:05:03.720> piece<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.320> about<00:05:04.770> tab<00:05:05.190> technique<00:05:05.970> that

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
little piece of about tab technique that

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.600 
little piece of about tab technique that
use<00:05:06.570> tab<00:05:07.110> uh-huh<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.600> I<00:05:09.600> sewed<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.470> piece<00:05:11.370> of

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
use tab uh-huh and I sewed a piece of

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.490 
use tab uh-huh and I sewed a piece of
velcro<00:05:11.910> tape<00:05:12.600> onto<00:05:13.820> one<00:05:14.820> end<00:05:15.150> and<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.810> used<00:05:16.140> the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
velcro tape onto one end and I used the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.580 
velcro tape onto one end and I used the
rough<00:05:16.770> side<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.160> loop<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:18.419> loop<00:05:18.660> type<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.380> hook

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
rough side a loop the loop type the hook

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.400 
rough side a loop the loop type the hook
side<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:21.000> reason<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.419> did<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.690> is<00:05:21.900> when<00:05:22.260> it's

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
side the reason I did that is when it's

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.430 
side the reason I did that is when it's
open<00:05:22.980> that<00:05:23.610> will<00:05:23.880> leave<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.330> softer<00:05:24.870> side<00:05:25.110> on

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
open that will leave the softer side on

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.770 
open that will leave the softer side on
here<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:26.040> when<00:05:26.190> I'm<00:05:26.340> brushing<00:05:26.580> against<00:05:27.540> it

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
here and when I'm brushing against it

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.810 
here and when I'm brushing against it
and<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.380> won't<00:05:28.530> stick<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:29.130> other<00:05:29.250> that's<00:05:29.640> a

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
and it won't stick to other that's a

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.090 
and it won't stick to other that's a
good<00:05:29.970> point<00:05:30.180> yeah<00:05:30.570> it's<00:05:30.930> subject<00:05:31.410> is<00:05:31.710> easier

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
good point yeah it's subject is easier

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.740 
good point yeah it's subject is easier
when<00:05:32.310> they're<00:05:32.490> using<00:05:32.730> velcro<00:05:33.090> tape<00:05:33.540> don't

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
when they're using velcro tape don't

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
when they're using velcro tape don't
always<00:05:33.960> think<00:05:34.050> ahead<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.460> really<00:05:35.669> makes

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
always think ahead and that really makes

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.080 
always think ahead and that really makes
the<00:05:36.150> difference<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.840> ease<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.290> use<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:38.060> then<00:05:39.060> I

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
the difference in ease of use and then I

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.110 
the difference in ease of use and then I
just<00:05:39.390> stitched<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:40.020> is<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.470> sew<00:05:41.280> on<00:05:41.490> brand

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
just stitched this is the sew on brand

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.170 
just stitched this is the sew on brand
of<00:05:42.450> Velcro<00:05:42.960> fastener<00:05:43.260> mm-hmm<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.669> really

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.909 
of Velcro fastener mm-hmm and really
this<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.510> on<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.720> think<00:05:45.930> would<00:05:46.290> provide

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
this so on I think would provide

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.430 
this so on I think would provide
longevity<00:05:47.910> exactly<00:05:48.720> you're<00:05:48.900> gonna<00:05:48.990> be<00:05:49.229> like

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
longevity exactly you're gonna be like

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.930 
longevity exactly you're gonna be like

did on this one I see and then sew right
along<00:06:12.150> where<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:12.600> top<00:06:12.900> stitched<00:06:13.290> so<00:06:14.010> that<00:06:14.250> you

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
along where you top stitched so that you

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.480 
along where you top stitched so that you
don't<00:06:14.610> have<00:06:14.760> a<00:06:14.820> lot<00:06:15.030> of<00:06:15.060> stitches<00:06:15.419> only<00:06:16.490> to

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
don't have a lot of stitches only to

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.390 
don't have a lot of stitches only to
cover<00:06:17.760> up<00:06:18.030> I<00:06:18.300> also<00:06:18.990> just<00:06:19.740> give<00:06:20.100> it<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.280> little

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
cover up I also just give it a little

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.580 
cover up I also just give it a little
action<00:06:20.790> because<00:06:21.000> I<00:06:21.120> admit<00:06:21.630> I<00:06:21.660> don't<00:06:22.050> know<00:06:22.260> how

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
action because I admit I don't know how

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.420 
action because I admit I don't know how
to<00:06:22.880> sew<00:06:23.880> buttons<00:06:24.330> on<00:06:24.630> my<00:06:24.660> sewing<00:06:24.930> machine

to sew buttons on my sewing machine

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.400 
to sew buttons on my sewing machine
that's<00:06:26.430> so<00:06:26.729> velcro<00:06:27.210> who<00:06:27.330> makes<00:06:27.780> it<00:06:27.990> look<00:06:28.169> like

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.740 
that's so velcro who makes it look like
I<00:06:28.560> have<00:06:28.740> to<00:06:28.890> have<00:06:29.040> any<00:06:29.310> closure<00:06:29.640> well<00:06:30.510> that's

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
I have to have any closure well that's

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.810 
I have to have any closure well that's
good<00:06:31.080> what<00:06:31.470> an<00:06:31.590> easy<00:06:31.830> project<00:06:32.220> and<00:06:32.610> like<00:06:32.700> you

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
say it was sort of born out of necessity

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.170 
say it was sort of born out of necessity
knowing<00:06:34.950> that<00:06:35.130> you<00:06:35.250> wanted<00:06:35.520> something<00:06:35.729> light

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
knowing that you wanted something light

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.230 
knowing that you wanted something light
and<00:06:36.630> sometimes<00:06:37.380> when<00:06:37.590> people<00:06:37.620> travel<00:06:38.400> to

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
and sometimes when people travel to

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.540 
and sometimes when people travel to
their<00:06:39.990> suitcases<00:06:40.410> maybe<00:06:40.770> almost<00:06:41.280> to<00:06:41.460> the

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
their suitcases maybe almost to the

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.430 
their suitcases maybe almost to the
limit<00:06:41.910> so<00:06:41.940> if<00:06:42.360> you<00:06:42.479> can<00:06:42.630> eliminate<00:06:42.720> that<00:06:43.080> big

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
limit so if you can eliminate that big

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.189 
limit so if you can eliminate that big
leather<00:06:43.710> case<00:06:44.130> this<00:06:44.610> would<00:06:44.819> help<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:45.419> for

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
leather case this would help and for

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.749 
leather case this would help and for
this<00:06:46.319> one<00:06:46.560> you<00:06:46.590> could<00:06:46.919> do<00:06:47.069> a<00:06:47.099> little<00:06:47.490> longer

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
this one you could do a little longer

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.749 
this one you could do a little longer
and<00:06:48.590> instead<00:06:49.590> of<00:06:49.710> doing<00:06:49.889> the<00:06:50.009> tab<00:06:50.280> you<00:06:50.550> could

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
and instead of doing the tab you could

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.150 
and instead of doing the tab you could
just<00:06:51.060> sew<00:06:51.300> the<00:06:51.900> velcro<00:06:52.050> tape<00:06:52.620> into<00:06:53.039> the

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
just sew the velcro tape into the

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.820 
just sew the velcro tape into the
insight<00:06:53.550> to<00:06:53.729> have<00:06:53.880> a<00:06:53.910> full<00:06:54.270> closure<00:06:54.569> it<00:06:55.470> folds

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
insight to have a full closure it folds

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.920 
insight to have a full closure it folds
