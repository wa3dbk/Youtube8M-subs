00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.939
 Yes it is 8 years ago 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.720
 I had forgotten just one more time so I once again 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.720
 I took a video 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.520
 Gp now 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 It is connected to d mobile of gl 04 p 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:29.230
 Than did not compare Toka of speed in the usual line 3g line of mobile phone of au 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.410
 It's a little time this time already all at once 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.970
 4 types of speed tests 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.670
 I think I'm going to go to the room 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.820
 I will try from water mobile 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 I'm good at lead 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.900
 You are quick 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.130
 yeah 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.310
 Middle eye 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.540
 is not it 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.540
 15 mega 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 Load is 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.770
 The preload is 4 mega 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.030
 It is a background 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 From next to 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 Next is 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:20.780
 I accidentally connected to the battle 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.210
 It seems that it was not well after the establishment of a clear sunny day, and only 13 people were out. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.050
 But I think it will be faster 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.320
 I will see 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.320

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 eh 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.540
 Not really 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.650
 There is a firm improvement method 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 I have not identified 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.740
 However, 11 people are well supported 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.770
 Pu Road is fast ne er 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.820
 6 people is the pace too entered go next 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.370
 I heard wi-fi 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 Because 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.700
 au's 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:08.200
 3g of overbite clogging 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:12.200
 Wi-fi is not in use anymore, but is in the state of netting of ordinary mobile phones 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.920
 How fast is this how to win the shrimp 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.920

 1.5 eyes are 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.870
 Because 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.689
 A wi-fi router Guchuu 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.310
 Because there was a eye 1 of 10 minutes 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.150
 Is the speed of 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.710
 Yes 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.030
 After all it 's totally different. 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.180
 So I went three times today 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.269
 wimax 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.970
 It comes with the Te wimax in the galaxy s ii 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.720
 Start wimax village 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.720
 I will try 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.510
 It is this wimax 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.440
 here 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.900
 It was 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.480
 I'm not using wimax button at all, but it would be a dirty word blowjob 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:33.850
 sp test try reading comprehension this wimax with 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.510
 It seems that you can do it after female monthly fee 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.510
 This is it 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 Oh men

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.500
 15 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.690
 Why Optical Circuits 11 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:21.720
 sag is 1.5 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:28.460
 US wimax This results in 7.8
