this is the man called station and when
you<00:01:10.180> go<00:01:10.299> by<00:01:10.479> it's<00:01:10.690> going<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:11.020> stop<00:01:11.229> the

actually have two options you can

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.389 
actually have two options you can
continue<00:01:22.450> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.080> way<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:24.220> were

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
continue going to the way you you were

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.580 
continue going to the way you you were
going<00:01:24.670> before<00:01:24.850> or<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.690> can<00:01:25.810> also<00:01:25.990> go<00:01:26.259> back<00:01:26.409> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
going before or you can also go back to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.460 
going before or you can also go back to
where<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:26.890> came<00:01:27.009> from<00:01:27.159> now<00:01:27.909> on<00:01:28.420> either<00:01:28.840> either

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
where you came from now on either either

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.130 
where you came from now on either either
options<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:31.000> just<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.630> look<00:01:31.840> to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
options you can you just have to look to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.320 
options you can you just have to look to
the<00:01:32.170> direction<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:32.890> want<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> go<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.549> press

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
the direction you want to go and press

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.910 
the direction you want to go and press
forward<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:34.960> let's<00:01:35.229> say<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.590> want<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.830> go

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
forward so let's say that you want to go

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.800 
forward so let's say that you want to go
back<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.280> where<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.700> came<00:01:36.789> from<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.570> just

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
back to where you came from you just

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.690 
back to where you came from you just
have<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:38.140> look<00:01:38.320> over<00:01:38.470> here<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.950> press<00:01:39.340> forward

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
have to look over here and press forward

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.570 
have to look over here and press forward
just<00:01:40.149> like<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.479> well<00:01:41.440> yeah<00:01:41.890> now<00:01:42.130> that's<00:01:42.399> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
just like that well yeah now that's the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.120 
just like that well yeah now that's the
basic<00:01:42.970> principle<00:01:43.509> for<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:44.080> system<00:01:44.410> so<00:01:44.800> i

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
basic principle for the system so i

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.219 
basic principle for the system so i
think<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.610> can<00:01:45.910> go<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.390> restaurant<00:01:46.990> now

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
think we can go to the restaurant now

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.399 
think we can go to the restaurant now
shall<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:49.119> here's<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.810> whole<00:01:49.990> redstone

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
shall we so here's the whole redstone

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.260 
shall we so here's the whole redstone
and<00:01:50.590> as<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.100> see<00:01:51.130> there<00:01:51.429> is<00:01:51.520> no<00:01:51.700> real<00:01:51.970> red

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
and as you can see there is no real red

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.060 
and as you can see there is no real red
stone<00:01:52.479> at<00:01:52.630> all<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:53.200> only<00:01:53.470> thing<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.770> can<00:01:53.920> see

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
stone at all the only thing you can see

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.919 
stone at all the only thing you can see
here<00:01:54.310> are<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.819> rails<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.390> these<00:01:55.659> levers

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
here are the rails and these levers

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.410 
here are the rails and these levers
right<00:01:56.319> here<00:01:56.530> but<00:01:57.039> apart<00:01:57.429> from<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.610> what's

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
right here but apart from that what's

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.840 
right here but apart from that what's
very<00:01:58.720> cool<00:01:59.020> about<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.409> system<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.890> that<00:01:59.950> even

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
very cool about this system is that even

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.940 
very cool about this system is that even
though<00:02:01.000> we<00:02:01.149> super<00:02:01.569> cheap<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.020> super<00:02:02.619> simple

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
though we super cheap and super simple

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.850 
though we super cheap and super simple
the<00:02:03.429> system<00:02:04.030> works<00:02:04.210> like<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.539> charm<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.470> when

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
the system works like a charm so when

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.830 
the system works like a charm so when
you<00:02:05.979> go<00:02:06.100> by<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.310> station<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:07.060> going<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.509> stop

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
you go by the station is going to stop

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.889 
you go by the station is going to stop
you<00:02:08.020> on<00:02:08.259> these<00:02:08.819> impart<00:02:09.819> rail<00:02:10.119> right<00:02:10.450> here<00:02:10.660> and

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
you on these impart rail right here and

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.650 
you on these impart rail right here and
you<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.610> have<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.970> option<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.300> continue

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you now have the option to continue

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.020 
you now have the option to continue
going<00:02:13.959> forward<00:02:14.140> or<00:02:14.620> go<00:02:15.190> back<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.580> where<00:02:15.910> you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
going forward or go back to where you

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.360 
going forward or go back to where you
were<00:02:16.180> before<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:17.380> either<00:02:17.680> option<00:02:17.950> you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
were before and on either option you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.949 
were before and on either option you
just<00:02:18.610> have<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.879> look<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.330> way<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.599> want<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
just have to look on the way you want to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.839 
just have to look on the way you want to
go<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.470> let's<00:02:20.500> say<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.099> want<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.430> go<00:02:21.550> back

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
go so let's say that you want to go back

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.930 
go so let's say that you want to go back
you<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.830> when<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.980> look<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> direction

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you and when you look on the direction

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.180 
you and when you look on the direction
just<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.750> press<00:02:26.050> forward<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:27.099> like

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
just have to press forward just like

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.180 
just have to press forward just like
that<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.599> can<00:02:28.750> also<00:02:28.900> call<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.770> words

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
that and you can also call for words

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.369 
that and you can also call for words
like<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:33.489> yeah<00:02:33.640> now<00:02:33.910> this<00:02:34.569> is<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.959> system

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
like that so yeah now this is the system

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.320 
like that so yeah now this is the system
B<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.709> pretty<00:02:35.980> simple<00:02:36.160> as<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.489> say<00:02:36.790> many<00:02:37.090> times

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
B is pretty simple as I say many times

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.510 
B is pretty simple as I say many times
before<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.989> because<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.980> ain't<00:02:39.250> going

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
before and because of that I ain't going

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.699 
before and because of that I ain't going
to<00:02:39.670> stop<00:02:39.940> being<00:02:40.150> lazy<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.690> actually<00:02:41.379> make<00:02:41.530> a

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
to stop being lazy and actually make a

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.540 
to stop being lazy and actually make a
stir<00:02:42.069> so<00:02:42.430> now<00:02:42.940> let's<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.330> call<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:45.010> now

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
stir so now let's just call that so now

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.220 
stir so now let's just call that so now
you're<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.269> start<00:02:46.510> where<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.810> want<00:02:47.050> a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
you're going to start where you want a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.100 
you're going to start where you want a
minecart<00:02:47.560> station<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.069> be<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.430> put<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.819> man

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
minecart station to be and put a man

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.320 
minecart station to be and put a man
golden<00:02:50.110> rail<00:02:50.349> in<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.739> middle<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.400> now<00:02:52.180> you're

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
golden rail in the middle and now you're

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.199

last one and as you can see it's going
to<00:03:04.330> power<00:03:04.480> off<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.230> rails<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:05.800> they<00:03:06.160> made<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
to power off the rails but they made the

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.259 
to power off the rails but they made the
one<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.590> yeah<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:09.069> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.790> you're

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
going to repeat this on the other side

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.630 
going to repeat this on the other side
267

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
267

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.809 
267
and<00:03:15.730> put<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.240> tracks<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:17.380> like<00:03:17.620> thanks<00:03:17.950> for

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
and put the tracks just like thanks for

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.390 
and put the tracks just like thanks for
words<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.720> as<00:03:20.020> we<00:03:20.170> see<00:03:20.319> now<00:03:20.530> all<00:03:20.800> of<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.160> rails

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
words and as we see now all of the rails

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.760 
words and as we see now all of the rails
but<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.910> middle<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:22.360> are<00:03:22.569> pout<00:03:22.990> now<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
but the middle one are pout now the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.640 
but the middle one are pout now the
trick<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.550> power<00:03:24.970> these<00:03:25.450> two<00:03:26.050> rails<00:03:26.500> right

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
trick is to power these two rails right

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.190 
trick is to power these two rails right
here<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.610> ones<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.209> are<00:03:28.750> not<00:03:28.959> very

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
here so the ones that are not very

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.559 
here so the ones that are not very
middle<00:03:29.590> one<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:29.950> now<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:31.060> remove<00:03:31.270> these

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
middle one and now you can remove these

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.660 
middle one and now you can remove these
rails<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.230> like<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.620> because<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.520> not

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
rails just like that because it's not

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.640 
rails just like that because it's not
going<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.030> update<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.630> middle<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:35.590> you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
going to update the middle one so you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.800 
going to update the middle one so you
can<00:03:36.040> have<00:03:36.250> these<00:03:36.490> tracks<00:03:36.820> over<00:03:37.180> here<00:03:37.330> bored

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
can have these tracks over here bored

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.460 
can have these tracks over here bored
and<00:03:38.290> amid<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.709> one<00:03:38.860> on<00:03:39.130> part<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:41.140> just<00:03:41.170> have

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
and amid the one on part you just have

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.500 
and amid the one on part you just have
to<00:03:41.620> be<00:03:41.920> careful<00:03:42.220> because<00:03:42.520> if<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.330> update

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
to be careful because if you update

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.229 
to be careful because if you update
these<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.680> strike<00:03:45.310> over<00:03:45.580> here<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.910> going<00:03:46.000> to

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
these the strike over here is going to

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.470 
these the strike over here is going to
update<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.350> it's<00:03:47.800> going<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.130> get<00:03:48.430> part<00:03:48.760> so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
update it and it's going to get part so

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.660 
update it and it's going to get part so
you<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.989> fix<00:03:50.230> everything<00:03:50.590> it's<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.430> little

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670

you have to fix everything it's a little
bit<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.060> pain<00:03:52.209> but<00:03:52.680> another<00:03:53.680> thing<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.160> I

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
bit of a pain but another thing that I

have to mention is that if you are too
fast<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.300> minecart<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.840> are<00:03:58.930> going<00:03:59.140> to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
fast we the minecart you are going to

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.860 
fast we the minecart you are going to
pass<00:03:59.739> through<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.700> track<00:04:00.940> without<00:04:01.150> stopping

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
pass through the track without stopping

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.250 
pass through the track without stopping
light<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:04.450> do<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.780> just<00:04:04.959> have

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
light on it and to do that you just have

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.229 
light on it and to do that you just have
to<00:04:05.410> slow<00:04:05.800> down<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.040> little<00:04:06.340> bit<00:04:06.519> you<00:04:06.850> don't<00:04:07.150> have

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
to slow down a little bit you don't have

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.050 
to slow down a little bit you don't have
to<00:04:07.360> worry<00:04:07.540> about<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:08.830> much<00:04:09.010> well<00:04:09.970> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
to worry about that so so much well the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.190 
to worry about that so so much well the
time<00:04:10.239> apart<00:04:10.450> from<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.780> think<00:04:10.930> that's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
time apart from that I think that's

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.470 
time apart from that I think that's
basically<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.830> and<00:04:12.100> it's<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:13.090> pretty<00:04:13.300> simple

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
basically it and it's a pretty simple

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.509 
basically it and it's a pretty simple
it's<00:04:14.019> a<00:04:14.260> pretty<00:04:14.470> simple<00:04:14.739> designed<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.459> know

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
it's a pretty simple designed I know

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.270 
it's a pretty simple designed I know
that<00:04:15.850> but<00:04:16.329> I'm<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.049> make<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> very<00:04:18.070> nice

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
that but I'm going to make a very nice

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.210 
that but I'm going to make a very nice
design<00:04:18.940> based<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.229> school<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.680> this

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
design based on that school on this

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.520 
design based on that school on this
concept<00:04:21.400> on<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.850> next<00:04:22.300> week<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:23.020> be<00:04:23.050> sure<00:04:23.350> to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
concept on the next week so be sure to

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.620 
concept on the next week so be sure to
check<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.070> routes<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.760> apart<00:04:25.330> from<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.479> I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
check the routes and apart from that I

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.600 
check the routes and apart from that I
think<00:04:25.780> that's<00:04:26.140> basically<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.710> so<00:04:27.010> thanks

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
think that's basically it so thanks

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.200 
think that's basically it so thanks
watching<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.210> see<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.840> next<00:04:28.930> time
