not by that I wonder if it's one of
those<00:06:14.110> things<00:06:14.410> that<00:06:14.530> way<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:15.699> more<00:06:15.849> you<00:06:15.940> hear

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
those things that way the more you hear

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.149 
those things that way the more you hear
the<00:06:16.180> music<00:06:16.270> the<00:06:16.569> more<00:06:16.690> you<00:06:16.810> appreciate<00:06:16.960> it<00:06:17.440> but

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
the music the more you appreciate it but

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.370 
the music the more you appreciate it but
I<00:06:18.280> when<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.180> first<00:06:19.509> saw<00:06:19.720> this<00:06:19.840> I<00:06:19.990> had<00:06:20.139> the<00:06:20.229> same

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
I when I first saw this I had the same

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.499 
I when I first saw this I had the same
feeling<00:06:20.440> as<00:06:20.919> you<00:06:21.069> it<00:06:21.550> didn't<00:06:21.880> it<00:06:22.060> didn't<00:06:22.330> Wow

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
feeling as you it didn't it didn't Wow

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.020 
feeling as you it didn't it didn't Wow
me<00:06:22.539> but<00:06:23.440> I<00:06:23.470> think<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.830> way<00:06:23.949> he<00:06:24.130> acts<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:24.759> and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
me but I think the way he acts it and

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.420 
me but I think the way he acts it and
portrays<00:06:25.659> it<00:06:25.960> and<00:06:26.349> captures<00:06:26.889> the<00:06:27.009> mood<00:06:27.220> of<00:06:27.340> the

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
portrays it and captures the mood of the

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.879 
portrays it and captures the mood of the
time<00:06:27.460> for<00:06:28.060> me<00:06:28.180> I<00:06:28.360> question<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.229> the<00:06:29.259> outfit

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
time for me I question the the outfit

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.770 
time for me I question the the outfit
you<00:06:30.069> know<00:06:30.130> I<00:06:30.190> prefer<00:06:30.639> it<00:06:30.699> to<00:06:30.759> be<00:06:30.849> a<00:06:31.150> little<00:06:31.569> bit

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
you know I prefer it to be a little bit

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.990 
you know I prefer it to be a little bit
more<00:06:31.900> dressed<00:06:32.259> jackets<00:06:33.159> rather<00:06:33.490> than<00:06:33.729> the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
more dressed jackets rather than the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.719 
more dressed jackets rather than the
shirt<00:06:34.240> I<00:06:34.539> think<00:06:35.139> I've<00:06:35.500> got<00:06:35.650> over<00:06:35.919> that<00:06:36.069> now<00:06:36.310> but

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
shirt I think I've got over that now but

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.620 
shirt I think I've got over that now but
the<00:06:36.819> way<00:06:37.000> he<00:06:37.199> facially<00:06:38.199> portrays<00:06:38.680> it<00:06:38.919> and

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
the way he facially portrays it and

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.719 
the way he facially portrays it and
manages<00:06:40.630> to<00:06:40.659> maintain<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.830> feel<00:06:42.069> of<00:06:42.340> the<00:06:42.430> of

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:42.729 
manages to maintain the feel of the of

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.300 
manages to maintain the feel of the of
the<00:06:42.880> routine<00:06:43.389> and<00:06:44.139> it<00:06:44.259> has<00:06:44.440> this<00:06:44.590> rise<00:06:45.009> and

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
the routine and it has this rise and

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.159 
the routine and it has this rise and
fall<00:06:45.520> about<00:06:45.819> it<00:06:46.090> it's<00:06:46.270> it's<00:06:46.509> not<00:06:46.719> staying<00:06:47.020> the

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
fall about it it's it's not staying the

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.589 
fall about it it's it's not staying the
same<00:06:47.199> level<00:06:47.880> and<00:06:48.880> I<00:06:49.000> think<00:06:49.030> that's<00:06:49.360> what<00:06:49.570> I

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
same level and I think that's what I

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.379 
same level and I think that's what I
like<00:06:49.840> too<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.110> has<00:06:50.199> an<00:06:50.349> intensity<00:06:50.889> and<00:06:51.310> then<00:06:52.120> a

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
like too it has an intensity and then a

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.930 
like too it has an intensity and then a
relaxation<00:06:53.080> very<00:06:53.620> difficult<00:06:54.280> and<00:06:54.430> daring<00:06:54.820> on

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
relaxation very difficult and daring on

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.860 
relaxation very difficult and daring on
the

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
the

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.630 
the
and<00:06:56.870> almost<00:06:57.200> actually<00:06:57.650> fallen<00:06:58.160> on<00:06:58.280> the<00:06:58.430> end<00:06:58.550> of

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
and almost actually fallen on the end of

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.510 
and almost actually fallen on the end of
it<00:06:58.760> I<00:06:58.790> felt<00:06:59.690> that<00:06:59.810> it<00:07:00.440> was<00:07:00.560> a<00:07:00.590> little<00:07:01.130> bit<00:07:01.370> too

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
it I felt that it was a little bit too

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.020 
it I felt that it was a little bit too
concentrated<00:07:02.680> well<00:07:03.680> I<00:07:03.710> I<00:07:03.860> liked<00:07:04.490> it<00:07:04.700> because<00:07:04.820> I

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
concentrated well I I liked it because I

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.260 
concentrated well I I liked it because I
think<00:07:05.090> I<00:07:05.390> think<00:07:05.690> for<00:07:05.960> me<00:07:06.110> it<00:07:06.710> had<00:07:07.010> the<00:07:07.280> intense

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
think I think for me it had the intense

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.270 
think I think for me it had the intense
moment<00:07:08.810> that<00:07:08.960> feel<00:07:09.200> and<00:07:09.440> then<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:09.920> lightness

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
moment that feel and then the lightness

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.220 
moment that feel and then the lightness
in<00:07:10.430> the<00:07:10.490> relaxing<00:07:10.970> and<00:07:11.120> that<00:07:11.600> the<00:07:11.750> music<00:07:11.900> was

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
in the relaxing and that the music was

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.720 
in the relaxing and that the music was
doing<00:07:12.560> that<00:07:12.740> therefore<00:07:13.100> it<00:07:13.160> kept<00:07:13.370> my<00:07:13.460> interest

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
doing that therefore it kept my interest

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.590 
doing that therefore it kept my interest
right<00:07:14.330> the<00:07:14.540> way<00:07:14.660> through<00:07:15.640> so<00:07:16.640> maybe<00:07:17.420> it<00:07:17.540> is

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
right the way through so maybe it is

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.910 
right the way through so maybe it is
because<00:07:17.690> if<00:07:17.960> you<00:07:18.080> see<00:07:18.230> it<00:07:18.260> more<00:07:18.470> but<00:07:18.590> I<00:07:18.650> think

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
because if you see it more but I think

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.620 
because if you see it more but I think
they<00:07:19.190> haven't<00:07:19.460> skated<00:07:19.850> it<00:07:20.120> as<00:07:20.210> well<00:07:20.360> as<00:07:20.450> that

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630 
they haven't skated it as well as that

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.610 
they haven't skated it as well as that
as<00:07:20.780> far<00:07:20.960> as<00:07:21.080> I<00:07:21.170> can<00:07:21.230> see

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.550 

English<00:07:24.620> bill<00:07:24.830> band<00:07:25.040> goes<00:07:25.310> to<00:07:26.500> tweed<00:07:27.500> yes
