00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 there we will introduce you a new 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:10.110
 new technique of romagné a new 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.389
 momentum such that the material is at the level 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.599
 wire wire assembly relatively 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.340
 women trout fishing 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.920
 today is the brown trout the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.890
 wild suite that is so much 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.640
 extremely suspicious when we take a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.690
 will see this size if the ideal size 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 for tribe fishing and assembly 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.590
 it is essential to kill the fish 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.590
 to prevent him from suffering 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.270
 the pointed at loché 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.370
 we use to thread the thread in the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.480
 fish mouth trout barely 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.379
 usually see them on the side or 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.140
 at the back of the hooks if sis one 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.660
 can take eighteen or ten a montage 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.970
 simple goes back into the loop of the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.770
 monsoon did a few laps on the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.170
 Body dr line is threaded the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.220
 plan loop did beforehand 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.380
 we go back once alas it remains 1 to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 ceret the whole attention something 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.140
 which is essential it is well wet the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.300
 wire 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.770
 it prevents them from heating up 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.250
 much stronger 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 so we have the scull will see it and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.550
 the soul are behind us are threading the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.550
 scull in the veron's mouth 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.009
 it is crooked with a goal of reinforcement that 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.939
 is especially children's festivals 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.140
 this in the head of a deer blades are 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.140
 in the soissonnais 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.340
 the editing that is almost complete 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:08.030
 to prevent the fish in the evening 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.130
 curl when swimming we insert a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 small thorn 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.200
 must be the most natural 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.110
 possible the key word in fishing 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.330
 especially in trout fishing that's 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.020
 the discreet discretion of the assembly 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.070
 discretion of the evidence before 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 start the south east fishing action 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.180
 important to read the river saas 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.620
 and humor diane well say the river 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.240
 but also the environment and the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.710
 weather conditions are there for example 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.380
 we have the sun behind us 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.870
 to pass something that is not very 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 good since london go on the water 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.130
 and if if the brute perceives it she does not 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.490
 will not sell is good to read the course 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.380
 of water the potential positions and by 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.530
 particular conditions 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.540
 teaching one adapts one's approach in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.640
 adapt its wind is maybe the most 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.670
 accurate possible and the most discreet 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.670
 possible
