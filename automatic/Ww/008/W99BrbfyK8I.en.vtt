00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
last couple of weeks have really come

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070 
last couple of weeks have really come
out<00:00:26.310> today<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> backs<00:00:27.840> coach<00:00:27.960> we

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
out today I think the backs coach we

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.300 
out today I think the backs coach we
pretty<00:00:28.230> happy<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.529> myself<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.130> some<00:00:29.220> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
pretty happy with myself now for some of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.970 
pretty happy with myself now for some of
those<00:00:29.369> tries<00:00:29.670> us<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.869> border<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> us<00:00:31.410> came<00:00:31.769> back

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
those tries us a border to us came back

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
those tries us a border to us came back
in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> first<00:00:32.279> half<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.000> second<00:00:33.809> half

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
in the first half and then second half

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.080 
in the first half and then second half
we<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.410> ran<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:35.010> over<00:00:35.100> them<00:00:35.370> which<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.910> good

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
we just ran all over them which was good

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
we just ran all over them which was good
fun<00:00:36.239> we're<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:37.050> killed<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> look<00:00:37.950> over

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
fun we're now then killed it look over

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.290 
fun we're now then killed it look over
were<00:00:38.250> quite<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> few<00:00:38.520> penalties<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> first

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
were quite a few penalties in the first

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.639 
were quite a few penalties in the first
half<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.899> wanted<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> minimize<00:00:40.260> those

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
half so we wanted to minimize those

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.139 
half so we wanted to minimize those
first<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.160> felt<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.700> keep<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
first we felt that we keep them in the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
first we felt that we keep them in the
game<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.420> those<00:00:42.570> penalties<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.620> we

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
game with those penalties so I think we

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229 
game with those penalties so I think we
keep<00:00:44.160> their<00:00:44.370> intensity<00:00:44.820> maybe<00:00:45.030> there's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
keep their intensity maybe there's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.610 
keep their intensity maybe there's
dropped<00:00:45.450> away<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.840> bit<00:00:45.930> obviously<00:00:46.410> gave

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
dropped away a little bit obviously gave

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
dropped away a little bit obviously gave
way<00:00:46.739> less<00:00:46.920> penalties<00:00:47.280> there's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> bit<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
way less penalties there's a bit of a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.850 
way less penalties there's a bit of a
wind<00:00:48.570> behind<00:00:48.750> us<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> second<00:00:49.440> half<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.739> we

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
wind behind us in the second half so we

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.080 
wind behind us in the second half so we
pay<00:00:50.129> territory<00:00:50.520> lot<00:00:50.670> better<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> both

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
pay territory lot better and both

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.700 
pay territory lot better and both
pressure<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.600> better<00:00:51.719> ultimately<00:00:52.590> they

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
pressure a lot better ultimately they

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
pressure a lot better ultimately they
cracked<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> fugue<00:00:53.399> atrocity<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:53.910> there

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
cracked and a fugue atrocity in there

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
cracked and a fugue atrocity in there
coming<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.110> two<00:00:55.289> out<00:00:55.440> rookies<00:00:55.860> they

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
coming in with two out rookies they

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
coming in with two out rookies they
stepped<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.180> much<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.690> made<00:00:57.870> us<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
stepped up so much and made us have to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.510 
stepped up so much and made us have to
skip<00:00:58.649> step<00:00:59.340> up<00:01:00.289> another<00:01:01.289> level<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.340> been

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
skip step up another level it's been

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
skip step up another level it's been

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
right throughout the whole series so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
right throughout the whole series so

before<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> tour<00:01:40.979> even<00:01:41.250> about<00:01:41.490> building<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
before the tour even about building a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.310 
before the tour even about building a
strong<00:01:42.060> foundation<00:01:42.090> leading<00:01:42.990> towards<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
next world cup and I think that's a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.530 
next world cup and I think that's a
pretty<00:01:44.579> strong<00:01:44.700> foundation<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.420> laid

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
pretty strong foundation we just laid

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030
