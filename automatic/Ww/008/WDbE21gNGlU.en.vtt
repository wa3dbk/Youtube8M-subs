00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 base aliens found in Transcarpathia 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.960
 sensational discovery made the Ukrainian 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.090
 ufologists regular visits ufo on 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.639
 over the past weeks, fixed 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.990
 residents of two regions at once 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.610
 Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv and now in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.949
 the anomalous zone finally arrived 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 experts who have found real 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.279
 alien tracks 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.740
 than the Carpathian mountains attract flying 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.420
 plates knows our correspondent Alexey 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.880
 Murashov 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 while at the gate Vladimir hussar 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 radar frames and follows 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 every square meter under his feet 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.290
 colleague Andrew sorrows to follow 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
 instrument readings miscalculation 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 search engines around here recently 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 landed anala and both men 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.180
 hope that special equipment 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.820
 help them find a landing place 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.820
 here is something like there andrew go 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.730
 here I will listen right in the center of the district 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.250
 searches for fuel oil lakes and a small hill 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.890
 burst out of the ground 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.739
 Cobain trash is believed to be a lake and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.260
 fire direct consequences of landing ufo and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.869
 to test it with a shovel take samples 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.970
 see how much iron is here 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.520
 filaments yellow red layers 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.220
 a lot of iron in the soil but this clay 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.020
 some blue tint and usually in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.590
 in our area you are nowhere else 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.810
 will find 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.820
 and this is one of the proofs that 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.910
 some unknown person has been here 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.430
 civilization reason to visit ufologists 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.530
 on the so-called Eastern Black Mountain 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.450
 parts of the Ukrainian Carpathians have become these 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.640
 pictures of local people by chance 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 photographed 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.810
 disc-shaped flying object reported 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.330
 about this ufologists and they immediately went 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.340
 check the information received on one 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.070
 from passes where it was shot and ufo 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.470
 carbide hussar and found possible 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 traces of alien mazut lakes and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.330
 fiery pillar I think that here 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.850
 huge energy is a place of power they 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.549
 come and draw energy in this place 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.100
 it is quite possible in the Carpathians in general 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.200
 powerful energy must be studied because 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.600
 that unfortunately much has not been investigated 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.710
 they stop mostly in the mountains 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.350
 stony ground 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.060
 this place is one of them in the vicinity 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.700
 intended landing site 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.030
 aliens several highland 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.450
 sat down 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.060
 incomprehensible death 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.430
 in the sky the most discussed topic among 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.340
 locals people have long noticed that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.260
 UFOs usually circle on the black mountain 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.450
 and then disappear somewhere in the valleys 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.610
 we have great strength and nobody here 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.189
 it flies as if they all agreed 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.079
 and ufo circling there over distant farms 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.689
 mountains where only a few houses 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.849
 we call him mystical now 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.519
 hello place bogdan you minchuk 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.200
 for many years and studies and the UFO message 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.209
 about spacecraft tracks in 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.819
 the Carpathian valleys are not at all 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.650
 amaze historian juxtaposed data about 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.930
 visits of aliens and came to the conclusion 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.780
 somewhere on the passes of the black mountain 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.299
 aliens built a base and time from 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.579
 time fly back there I think that they 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.159
 based behind the Montenegrin ridge us 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.680
 there is a big hollow with which hollow 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.959
 they would be good to take off the frequency there 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.900
 glow see the soul, we hear some 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.480
 talk a lot about it but why should she 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.879
 Chan base in the Carpathians Ufologists Vladimir 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.849
 hussar and andrew staple food suggest 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.099
 that newcomers are attracted to some useful 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.040
 fossils however experts right there 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.870
 negotiated until it is just a version 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.299
 conclusions can be made only after 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.819
 expertise ford taken from mazut 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.310
 lakes and in the hill of fire according to 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.120
 ufologists first data will appear approximately 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.250
 in a month 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.260
 so that by the end of autumn riddle 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 Carpathian UFO may be disclosed 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.450
