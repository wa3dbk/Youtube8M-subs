beta<00:01:25.409> out<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.920> second<00:01:26.640> beta<00:01:27.350> oh<00:01:29.869> yeah<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.520> they

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
beta out a second beta oh yeah and they

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.270 
beta out a second beta oh yeah and they
use<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.970> code<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.600> X<00:01:33.900> phone<00:01:34.250> which<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
use the code from X phone which is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
use the code from X phone which is
across<00:01:35.790> where<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.630> jailbreak<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.409> it's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
across where you can jailbreak but it's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280 
across where you can jailbreak but it's
like<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.090> different<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
like it's different from all all the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.100 
like it's different from all all the
other<00:01:40.439> jailbreaks<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.790> crosses<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.990> use

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
other jailbreaks it crosses you can use

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.179 
other jailbreaks it crosses you can use
win<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.530> mean<00:01:43.799> windows<00:01:45.049> OS<00:01:46.049> X<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.470> Linux<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
win I mean windows OS X and Linux and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.499 
win I mean windows OS X and Linux and
can<00:01:47.399> jailbreak<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
can jailbreak on all of them with the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.950 
can jailbreak on all of them with the
same<00:01:48.750> exponent<00:01:49.820> well<00:01:50.820> polish<00:01:51.030> 2<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.509> 2<00:01:51.659> point<00:01:51.899> 0

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
same exponent well polish 2 or 2 point 0

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.770 
same exponent well polish 2 or 2 point 0
point<00:01:52.200> 2<00:01:52.350> uses<00:01:52.740> code<00:01:52.979> from<00:01:53.189> X<00:01:53.430> phone<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
point 2 uses code from X phone so if you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.530 
point 2 uses code from X phone so if you
create<00:01:55.110> an<00:01:55.259> ipsw<00:01:55.740> bundle<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.610> pwnage<00:01:57.090> tool<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
create an ipsw bundle and pwnage tool to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.660 
create an ipsw bundle and pwnage tool to
point<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.840> by<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.070> use<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
point out by two you can use it in the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.920 
point out by two you can use it in the
