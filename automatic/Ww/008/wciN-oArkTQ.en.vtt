so I ran and grabbed some some knobs
there<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.590> linked<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> bolts<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there and then linked in the bolts that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.469 
there and then linked in the bolts that
I<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.600> using<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> three<00:01:19.590> inch<00:01:20.479> bolts

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
I was using these are a three inch bolts

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
I was using these are a three inch bolts
got<00:01:21.780> couple<00:01:22.560> lock<00:01:22.710> washers<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.580> regular

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
got couple lock washers just regular

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.350 
got couple lock washers just regular
washers<00:01:24.509> okay<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.580> length<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
washers okay and then on the length of

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.899 
washers okay and then on the length of
it<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:28.439> gonna<00:01:28.590> vary<00:01:28.680> wherever<00:01:29.640> you're<00:01:29.820> gonna

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it it's gonna vary wherever you're gonna

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.609 
it it's gonna vary wherever you're gonna
mount<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.500> really

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
mount it so that's not not really

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.609 
mount it so that's not not really
important<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.729> mine<00:01:33.270> were

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
important on this one but mine were

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.819 
important on this one but mine were
18:31

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
18:31

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.359 
18:31
and<00:01:35.960> these<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.110> 10<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> made<00:01:38.340> another

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and these are 10 and then I made another

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.410 
and these are 10 and then I made another
little<00:01:38.990> little<00:01:40.400> disc<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> just

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
little little disc for that and I just

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
little little disc for that and I just
the<00:01:42.840> wing<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.170> fine<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.649> because

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the wing that's fine on that because

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
the wing that's fine on that because
it's<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.280> bolted<00:01:44.700> together<00:01:44.850> anyway<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's all bolted together anyway and the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's all bolted together anyway and the
platform<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.770> made<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.600> depending<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.659> what

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
platform I made it depending on what

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
platform I made it depending on what
kind<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> camera<00:01:49.350> you're<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> use<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
kind of camera you're going to use it it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
kind of camera you're going to use it it
doesn't<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.909> anywhere<00:01:51.180> near<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
doesn't have to be anywhere near this

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.690 
doesn't have to be anywhere near this
big<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.140> made<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
big I made it this because I want to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
big I made it this because I want to
mount<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.000> big<00:01:54.240> digital<00:01:54.689> SLR<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> sometimes

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
mount my big digital SLR on it sometimes

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.310 
mount my big digital SLR on it sometimes
and<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.360> why<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> did<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and so that's why I did that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980 
and so that's why I did that
and<00:01:58.409> cut<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.490> these<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.540> not

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and cut out these this little not not

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.060 
and cut out these this little not not
sure<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:03.049> those<00:02:04.049> will<00:02:04.079> sleep<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.799> on

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
sure so that those will sleep in on

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.440 
sure so that those will sleep in on
there<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.030> basically<00:02:06.540> I'll<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:08.360> go<00:02:09.360> ahead

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
there so basically I'll just go ahead

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.990 
there so basically I'll just go ahead
and<00:02:09.629> put<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> back<00:02:10.050> together<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.970> did<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and put it back together and I did a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.710 
and put it back together and I did a
couple

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
couple

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.010 
couple
modifications<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.890> pictures<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.460> put<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.730> on

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
modifications the pictures I put up on

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.700 
modifications the pictures I put up on
Google+<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.200> Facebook<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:18.320> has<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> different

tripod<00:02:20.100> head<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.030> switched

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
tripod head on it but I would switched

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.140 
tripod head on it but I would switched
it<00:02:21.690> out<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> wanted<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.470> put<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> fluid<00:02:23.790> head<00:02:23.970> on

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it out I wanted to put a fluid head on

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.090 
it out I wanted to put a fluid head on
there<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.350> smoother<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.980> then

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
there so it's so it's smoother and then

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.900 
there so it's so it's smoother and then
I'm<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> mount<00:02:26.550> my<00:02:26.810> my<00:02:28.700> microphone<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.560 
I'm going to mount my my microphone to
it<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:31.490> switch<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.730> camera<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.270> mount

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
it to and switch the camera that I mount

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
on it so I will put it together now

on it so I will put it together now
just<00:02:36.870> great<00:02:37.530> forward<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> think<00:02:38.610> this

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
just great forward here I think this

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.680 
just great forward here I think this
caster<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.140> go<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:41.160> 4<00:02:41.730> inch<00:02:41.880> caster<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
caster if you go it's 4 inch caster and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.160 
caster if you go it's 4 inch caster and
it's<00:02:43.440> two<00:02:44.130> inches<00:02:44.460> wide<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> said<00:02:45.750> that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
it's two inches wide like I said that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:55.340 
it's two inches wide like I said that
expands<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.680> little<00:02:46.709> bit<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:50.670> over<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:54.350> right

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
expands a little bit this over all right

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
watch it to get tight enough to just

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.720 
watch it to get tight enough to just
stay<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:25.709> with<00:03:25.860> these<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.220> crank<00:03:26.550> it

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
and just touches right right in here so

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.250 
and just touches right right in here so
you<00:04:46.550> need<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.790> put<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.030> washer<00:04:47.930> on<00:04:47.990> there<00:04:48.170> to

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
you need to put a washer on there to

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.630 
you need to put a washer on there to
hold<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.560> off<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.890> plywood<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.280> little<00:04:49.520> bit

hold it off of the plywood a little bit

00:04:49.640 --> 00:05:03.970 
hold it off of the plywood a little bit
so<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.270> it'll<00:04:50.570> spin<00:04:51.220> nice<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.550> smooth<00:05:02.980> then

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
so that it'll spin nice and smooth then

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.630 
so that it'll spin nice and smooth then
that<00:05:04.160> way<00:05:04.690> you<00:05:05.690> can<00:05:05.960> loosen<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.620> up<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:09.640> it

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
that way you can loosen it up and it

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.200 
that way you can loosen it up and it
spins<00:05:11.090> nice<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.630> smooth<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:12.730> have<00:05:13.730> a<00:05:13.760> plan<00:05:14.060> I

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
spins nice and smooth I have a plan I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.120 
spins nice and smooth I have a plan I
just<00:05:14.240> screwed<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.750> piece<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.080> oak<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:16.010> the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130
