00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.550
 When it comes to performance, there's always something like that. 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.650
 What is used in a walking vehicle will be that for a race car 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.039
 we have been working with hypotheses 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.269
 we did not get to have sex 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.149
 I think yes, the storage engines 8 are not mounted. 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.370
 just listening to the machine in action can give you an idea 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.370
 how people are taken at 13 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.740
 I kept a gun for 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.920
 in the weekend in Teresina around 350 to 400 km 122 and not 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.790
 has 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.080
 It does not return well to the other without giving any hint you ever to keep the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.080
 car on the track on the track is not always on the limit 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.239
 the promoter though different from the touring cars 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.909
 souza farias model pieces what you have in the garage the candles by 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.160
 example 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.640
 the average vehicle they are exchanged on average every 30,000 kilometers 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.600
 I'm not here to make some change 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.060
 twice a year the temporary 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.939
 awakening responsible for the initial combustion fall 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.860
 within each segment 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 A Brazilian candle is for here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 hence an idea that is already more than 100 years old 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.520
 since that candle 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.399
 until the present day 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.399
 see how we evolved today a candle despite the news 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 weighs almost seven times more than a traditional candle 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.789
 today on top of the energy for everything in the car I came back on a2 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.260
 and for those who are curious to have dismounted looks only as an accountant 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.440
 has won in the past but also because 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.670
 the highest passes 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 it can produce enough tension 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
 powered by a mobile phone system 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:15.650
 the larger diary 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.650
 and it will stop 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.779
 as it is used to finance a normal car 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.999
 designated viability plan 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.999
 curious in the right measure not to let pass 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.099
 a grain of sand 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.079
 and here enters retaining cylinder and piston he remained in question is the 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.049
 enough to win the cylinder and scratching the cylinder it starts to 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:40.899
 pass the eye 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.349
 so if I look I get disgusted with the contest and make that white smoke that 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.099
 we saw ourselves on calle latino bunny saying today 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.700
 you deserve a thing of that expense why not change the air filter 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.259
 in the appropriate period 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:53.560
 a race 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.940
 another piece taken to the extreme is the oil filter per day 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.689
 as it does not work under very high pressure 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.590
 if not confused with tree macaulay 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.919
 this is the sixth attack then 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.769
 agreement must be cure it passes through the filter 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.059
 the filter holds these scores and I shahin there 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.400
 by the way let's not forget the fuel filter avoids problems 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.859
 in the injection 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.689
 You have to move forward. 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.809
 make your mind coordinated to in reality let's draw 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.809
 even with green fuel 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.670
 the eletronika gaining more and more space in the positions 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.029
 Hugo ChÃ¡vez 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:39.059
 the beginnings of the automobile have overcome new limits on the streets
