design element and as you can see here

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.349 
design element and as you can see here
it<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.960> striking<00:00:25.609> form<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.910> foliage

it combined with jasmine and geranium by
a<00:00:57.930> Cove<00:00:58.289> oh<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> design<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.600> did<00:01:00.840> with

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
a Cove oh this was a design we did with

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930 
a Cove oh this was a design we did with
all<00:01:01.230> white<00:01:01.469> flowers<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> looked<00:01:02.609> really

all white flowers that looked really

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.899 
all white flowers that looked really
great<00:01:03.059> there's<00:01:03.420> gardenia<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> background

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
great there's gardenia in the background

great there's gardenia in the background
so<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.430> basically<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.580> perennial<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so this is a basically a perennial and I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710 
so this is a basically a perennial and I
live<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.130> hot<00:01:11.369> inland<00:01:11.850> valley<00:01:12.119> during<00:01:12.600> the

live in a hot inland valley during the
summer<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> winter<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:14.130> freezes<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.970> not

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
summer in the winter it freezes but not

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.640 
summer in the winter it freezes but not
very<00:01:15.570> heavy

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
very heavy

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.210 
very heavy
this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.159> Hardy<00:01:17.640> down<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.470> around<00:01:19.470> 10<00:01:20.040> degrees

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this is Hardy down to around 10 degrees

this is Hardy down to around 10 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:21.150> plus<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.750> minus<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:23.210> it's<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
pretty flexible plant but that said it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.620 
pretty flexible plant but that said it
does<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.439> moisture<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.939> matter<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.299> fact

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
does like moisture as a matter of fact

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
does like moisture as a matter of fact
it<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> grow<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.590> water<00:01:31.920> I've<00:01:32.280> seen<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it can grow in water I've seen this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.210 
it can grow in water I've seen this
sitting<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.299> ponds<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.110> doing<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.650> well<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
sitting in ponds and doing very well and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.510 
sitting in ponds and doing very well and
then<00:01:36.060> depending<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.799> your<00:01:37.799> temperatures

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
then depending on your temperatures

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.539 
then depending on your temperatures
we're<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.450> area<00:01:39.810> where<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> humidity<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
we're in an area where the humidity is

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
we're in an area where the humidity is
very<00:01:41.670> low<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.170> very<00:01:43.439> hot<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.040> during

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
very low and it's very hot and during

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550 
very low and it's very hot and during
the<00:01:44.610> summer<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.270> definitely<00:01:45.840> needs<00:01:46.229> shade

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the summer this definitely needs shade

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.249 
the summer this definitely needs shade
in<00:01:46.860> an<00:01:47.009> area<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.899> from<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> hot

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
in an area like this from the hot

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
in an area like this from the hot
afternoon<00:01:49.500> Sun<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.430> likes<00:01:50.640> morning<00:01:51.149> light<00:01:51.390> or

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
afternoon Sun it likes morning light or

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.950 
afternoon Sun it likes morning light or
even<00:01:52.380> full<00:01:52.979> shade<00:01:53.369> although<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.600> kind<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
even full shade although it can kind of

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.780 
even full shade although it can kind of
flop<00:01:55.229> around<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.009> put<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.490> full<00:01:56.729> shade

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
flop around if you put it in full shade

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.929 
flop around if you put it in full shade
so<00:01:57.450> morning<00:01:57.899> light<00:01:58.140> seems<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.189> really

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
so morning light seems to be a really

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.840 
so morning light seems to be a really
good<00:02:00.090> exposure<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.930> hot<00:02:01.200> areas<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.670> if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
good exposure in hot areas and then if

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
good exposure in hot areas and then if
you're<00:02:03.000> near<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.270> coast<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.140> cooler

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
you're near the coast or in a cooler

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
you're near the coast or in a cooler
area<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.340> put<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.969> full<00:02:06.270> Sun<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> one

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
area you can put this in full Sun so one

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.029 
area you can put this in full Sun so one
of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.390> things<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.229> people<00:02:10.590> will<00:02:10.739> tell<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
of the things that people will tell you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.690 
of the things that people will tell you
about<00:02:11.459> this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
about this

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.559 
about this
that<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.120> prone<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:14.010> spreading<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.569> I've

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
that it's prone to spreading and I've

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.140 
that it's prone to spreading and I've
seen<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.260> lot<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.500> areas<00:02:18.040> where<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.670> have

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
seen it in a lot of areas where you have

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.940 
seen it in a lot of areas where you have
an<00:02:19.269> old<00:02:19.450> garden<00:02:19.959> somebody<00:02:20.440> came<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
an old garden somebody came in and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.009 
an old garden somebody came in and
tilled<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.849> did<00:02:22.120> some<00:02:22.330> different<00:02:22.750> things

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
tilled it and did some different things

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.020 
tilled it and did some different things
and<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.440> starts<00:02:23.890> popping<00:02:24.430> up<00:02:24.610> everywhere

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
and it just starts popping up everywhere

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.869 
and it just starts popping up everywhere
I've<00:02:25.480> never<00:02:26.260> had<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.709> spread<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.370> one<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
I've never had it spread in one of the

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.960 
I've never had it spread in one of the
yards<00:02:28.090> where<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.599> used<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.550> exactly

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
yards where I used it so I'm not exactly

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.600 
yards where I used it so I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.540> believe<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.470> rhizomes<00:02:33.010> once<00:02:33.400> they

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
sure I believe the rhizomes once they

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.000 
sure I believe the rhizomes once they
get<00:02:33.760> broken<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.260> get<00:02:35.410> spread<00:02:35.860> around

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
get broken up if they get spread around

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.949 
get broken up if they get spread around
they're<00:02:36.489> going<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> sprout<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.569> but<00:02:37.810> if

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
they're going to sprout on you but if

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.890 
they're going to sprout on you but if
you<00:02:38.110> plant<00:02:38.470> these<00:02:38.680> from<00:02:39.040> containers<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.540> set

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
you plant these from containers in a set

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.589 
you plant these from containers in a set
area<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.709> you're<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:42.430> disturbing<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.269> soil

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
area and you're not disturbing the soil

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.750 
area and you're not disturbing the soil
and<00:02:43.930> moving<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.410> around<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:45.099> not<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.549> these

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
and moving it around it's not like these

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.670 
and moving it around it's not like these
have<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> runner<00:02:46.480> that's<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> make<00:02:47.440> them

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
have a runner that's going to make them

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.720 
have a runner that's going to make them
spread<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:50.230> here's<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.739> thing<00:02:51.010> at<00:02:51.250> least<00:02:51.459> in

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
spread so here's the thing at least in

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.360 
spread so here's the thing at least in
hot<00:02:51.970> areas<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.630> where<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:52.900> live<00:02:53.349> during<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
hot areas like where I live during the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.940 
hot areas like where I live during the
summer<00:02:54.819> they<00:02:55.180> don't<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.720> our<00:02:55.989> extreme<00:02:56.560> heat

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
summer they don't like our extreme heat

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.089 
summer they don't like our extreme heat
these<00:02:57.849> will<00:02:58.090> actually<00:02:58.630> kind<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.079> lay<00:02:59.380> down<00:02:59.739> and

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
these will actually kind of lay down and

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.190 
these will actually kind of lay down and
sometimes<00:03:00.640> die<00:03:01.000> back<00:03:01.390> when<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:01.870> get<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
sometimes die back when we get the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.190 
sometimes die back when we get the
hottest<00:03:02.620> part<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.069> summer<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:04.200> they

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
hottest part of the summer and they

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.500 
hottest part of the summer and they
really<00:03:05.590> prefer<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.760> know<00:03:06.970> cooler

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
really prefer you know cooler

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.390 
really prefer you know cooler
temperatures<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.530> when<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:08.920> start<00:03:09.190> getting

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
temperatures so when we start getting

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.690 
temperatures so when we start getting
into<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.910> 90s<00:03:10.510> consistently<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.620> lot<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.340> times

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
into the 90s consistently a lot of times

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.300 
into the 90s consistently a lot of times
these<00:03:13.090> plants<00:03:13.569> don't<00:03:13.810> behave<00:03:14.200> well<00:03:14.560> they<00:03:15.099> look

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
these plants don't behave well they look

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.410 
these plants don't behave well they look
great<00:03:15.579> right<00:03:15.849> now<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.569> March<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:18.519> 50

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
different photos as a background plant

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.720 
different photos as a background plant
or<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.350> combination<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:54.310> some<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.639> these

other plants you've seen also the white

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.089 
other plants you've seen also the white
flower<00:03:58.180> certainly<00:03:58.959> distinctive<00:03:59.709> and<00:03:59.889> great

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
flower certainly distinctive and great

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.580 
flower certainly distinctive and great
for<00:04:00.340> cutting<00:04:00.630> but<00:04:01.630> looks<00:04:01.840> good<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.230> slightly

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
for cutting but looks good in slightly

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.449 
for cutting but looks good in slightly
shady<00:04:03.099> areas<00:04:03.639> because<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.239> white<00:04:04.420> color<00:04:04.780> pops

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
