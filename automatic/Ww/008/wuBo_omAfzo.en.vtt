thing like he's challenging himself um
but<00:04:45.580> I<00:04:45.639> really<00:04:45.910> think<00:04:46.030> we've<00:04:46.270> seen<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.630> extent

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
but I really think we've seen the extent

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.210 
but I really think we've seen the extent
of<00:04:47.080> what<00:04:47.229> sorrow<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.650> going<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.949> do<00:04:48.039> in<00:04:48.160> this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
of what sorrow is going to do in this

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.189 
of what sorrow is going to do in this
arc<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.580> really<00:04:48.849> think<00:04:49.000> maybe<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.810> next<00:04:49.960> big

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
arc I really think maybe the next big

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.200 
arc I really think maybe the next big
battle<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.590> going<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.860> be<00:04:50.979> Sabo<00:04:51.460> verses<00:04:52.180> Jesus
