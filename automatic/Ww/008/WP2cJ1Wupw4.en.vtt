00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 situation 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.519
 what if such a series finds the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.380
 easily overlooked the predecessor

 next player is a series and you 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.549
 All players do not have to fit 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.380
