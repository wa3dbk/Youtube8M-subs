 I was going from Bethlehem to santarém. 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.390
 the aeronautics initiative to recognize that such 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.260
 subsistence is an important advance according to the presidency of the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.600
 fire south zone 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.980
 I assume that this country complains 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.500
 is an attitude more determined with respect to the liberation that the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.440
 the Haitian population we are facing a reality. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 are being felt by other situations

 the flight control panel which is in the control panel of the airplane the system 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.710
 aims to avoid collisions in the art between aircraft 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.060
 according to the aeronautics document the toyota pilot was 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.660
 forced to make evasive maneuvers 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.960
 if the object and media light

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.800
 log that made the biggest flight in manaus-am also reported to have seen a light I think 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.960
 that at that time there was no local air traffic 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.310
 thousands of mystery 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.569
 is the order of the engineer ricardo varela of the inter institute of space researches 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.870
 for her is the Brazilian commission of ufologists and vice-president of milan com 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 the National Institute of Aerospace Phenomena Research 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.380
 just over an hour early, the commission went to court asking the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.020
 liberation of the aeronautics friends 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.360
 we take a silly goal even though this growth 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.989
 so far at the end 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.779
 in Rwanda where he saw the apartment window where he lives on the

 in the sea said psp source the youngest man billionaire 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.499
 formal 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.729
 even wrong 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.849
 humiliate 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.249
 I'll talk 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.680
 the miner reported that he passed the information to I do not know 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.449
 works as a condo security 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.499
 it also claims to have seen the same object 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.499
 first woman to receive the red 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.829
 needs to be 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.789
 in this round 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.789
 borges added 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.569
 since Wednesday 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.069
 the goals are that 8 million hits have been recorded 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.549
 people called and asked for money unidentified flying objects 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.239
 - at the beginning 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.660
 invited by the more relaxed aeronautics 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.909
 this adjustment 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.699
 is the transcript of a conversation between a mclaren pilot 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:35.040
 air traffic of curitiba the case was registered in 2003 see details of the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.409
 transcription of this recording 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.739
 we want the pilot to lose to the confirmed river 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.019
 position support says there are no airplanes of the vacancy the object that was being 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.779
 observed in the area and that did not appear of the nothing of other parallel volatrão 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:52.749
 we saw 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:58.319
 Even though he was apparently fit, the climb was red and 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.559
 was also coimbra in a rugby club after all Brazil 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:08.409
 I'm going to see the taxi driver who does not know what he thinks is not a star 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.779
 because there was a change at the summit when asked about human use 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.779
 building materials is a light 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.120
 the unidentified objects remained in the same position for three hours but 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.740
 I'll talk now, there's something like that. 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.139
 So you do not have to be afraid to say that you have 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.430
 reported reports are from the bento views the person receives reported having 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.419
 seen unidentified flying objects 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.020
 because the bends 12 scientists want now is to know details one of the most 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.159
 for example what happened on May 19, 1986 the episode 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.949
 became known as the night of the UFOs sandy beach 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.949
 General of the strange 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120
 Fernando 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.389
 on the return of Zelaya 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.800
 from Sao Paulo 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.550
 was the first time that aeronautics did 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.270
 to talk about it 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.889
 like New 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.380
 on the other side of the street 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.380
 is 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.309
 captain william ansa 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.569
 they demanded is also witness of the so-called night of outbreaks in Brazil 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.569
 the actress was a flight controller 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.719
 who was on duty at Rio de Janeiro time 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:45.610
 he says that it was a succession there are still many cases of pilots in 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.039
 various locations in the country 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.039
 our mission is to protect the residents does not exist 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.490
 there was a Brazilian aeronautical officer 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.529
 david silva 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.529
 it would be fair bandeirante airplane 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:00.979
 conjur 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.680
 piloted by 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.680
 landing positions 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.900
 and then it is only normal to err according to the second the report that we 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.599
 we have two silver balls that passed near the sea 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.089
 what's up 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.089
 a good night's sleep at the south pole the rebellion he went after us 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.740
 some years 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.280
 have had their reasons for not disclosing this already is part does not speak of a 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.749
 everyday 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:29.550
 if it's not bad 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.740
 in the aviation community 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.429
 than expensive technology.
