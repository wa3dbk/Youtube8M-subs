00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.000 
kind of look at and make a decision -
what<00:03:03.970> kind<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.210> band<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.540> put<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.990> woods<00:03:05.860> got

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
what kind of band to put on it woods got

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.280 
what kind of band to put on it woods got
a<00:03:06.040> lot<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.370> color<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.570> so<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:07.990> think<00:03:08.050> I'll

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
a lot of color to it so I think I'll

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.440 
a lot of color to it so I think I'll
probably<00:03:08.590> go<00:03:08.860> with<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.100> brass<00:03:09.550> colored<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.240> I

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
probably go with a brass colored and I

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.550 
probably go with a brass colored and I
think<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.750> probably<00:03:10.930> look<00:03:11.170> good<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.410> this

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
think that probably look good in this

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.400 
think that probably look good in this
call<00:03:11.850> okay<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.240> far<00:03:13.660> as<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.870> turning<00:03:14.230> goes

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
call okay as far as the turning goes

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.040 
call okay as far as the turning goes
that<00:03:14.740> would<00:03:14.890> be<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.520> on<00:03:15.820> turning<00:03:16.150> from<00:03:16.450> here<00:03:16.810> we

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
that would be it on turning from here we

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.940 
that would be it on turning from here we
begin<00:03:17.350> sanding<00:03:18.010> process

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.369 

put<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> few<00:03:25.250> drops<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.879> on<00:03:28.090> just<00:03:29.200> push<00:03:30.200> it

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
put a few drops of this on just push it

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.630 
put a few drops of this on just push it
into<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.860> pores

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
into all the pores

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.640 
into all the pores
it's<00:03:31.819> basically<00:03:32.180> beeswax<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:34.430> shellac

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's basically beeswax and a shellac

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.380 
it's basically beeswax and a shellac
okay<00:03:36.650> once<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.069> put<00:03:37.280> some<00:03:37.459> heat<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.909> this<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.269> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
okay once I put some heat to this on the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.350 
okay once I put some heat to this on the
lead<00:03:38.569> just<00:03:39.200> by<00:03:39.349> polishing<00:03:40.040> with<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.310> rag<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
lead just by polishing with a rag the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.449 
lead just by polishing with a rag the
finish<00:03:41.750> should<00:03:42.049> just<00:03:42.470> jump<00:03:42.890> out<00:03:43.040> right<00:03:43.310> now

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
finish should just jump out right now

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.539 
finish should just jump out right now
should<00:03:43.970> just<00:03:44.150> begin<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> globe<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:46.129> tuning

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
should just begin the globe the tuning

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.300 
should just begin the globe the tuning
of<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:47.260> about<00:03:48.260> what<00:03:48.500> I'll<00:03:48.590> do<00:03:48.769> is<00:03:48.920> begin<00:03:49.220> to

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
of it about what I'll do is begin to

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.860 
of it about what I'll do is begin to
make<00:03:49.459> some<00:03:49.640> adjustments<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.569> combination

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
make some adjustments to a combination

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.199 
make some adjustments to a combination
of<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.290> reed<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:52.250> tone<00:03:52.459> board<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.120> get

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
of the reed and the tone board to get

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.280 
of the reed and the tone board to get
the<00:03:53.360> desired<00:03:53.690> sound<00:03:54.459> every<00:03:55.459> insert<00:03:55.879> and<00:03:56.290> every

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
the desired sound every insert and every

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.470 
the desired sound every insert and every
call<00:03:57.500> will<00:03:57.859> be<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:58.040> little<00:03:58.340> different<00:03:58.730> it's<00:03:59.359> all

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
call will be a little different it's all

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.479 
call will be a little different it's all
based<00:03:59.750> on<00:03:59.959> what<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.379> reed<00:04:00.620> itself<00:04:01.040> sounds

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
based on what the reed itself sounds

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.729 
based on what the reed itself sounds
like<00:04:02.200> how<00:04:03.200> much<00:04:03.349> bounce<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.890> reed<00:04:04.069> has<00:04:04.660> and

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
like how much bounce the reed has and

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.830 
like how much bounce the reed has and
you<00:04:06.739> know<00:04:06.829> my<00:04:06.980> own<00:04:07.010> personal<00:04:07.720> preference<00:04:08.720> on

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
you know my own personal preference on

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.960 
you know my own personal preference on
doing<00:04:09.109> it<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.440> use<00:04:10.159> a<00:04:10.220> couple<00:04:10.430> different<00:04:10.760> style

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
doing it I use a couple different style

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.440 
doing it I use a couple different style
Reed<00:04:11.299> sets<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:11.870> can<00:04:12.829> kind<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.069> bounce<00:04:13.250> around

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
Reed sets I can kind of bounce around

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.920 
Reed sets I can kind of bounce around
and<00:04:14.450> get<00:04:14.750> what<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.290> want<00:04:15.560> by<00:04:15.859> changing<00:04:16.310> them

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
and get what I want by changing them

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.409 
and get what I want by changing them
I'll<00:04:17.930> start<00:04:18.229> off<00:04:18.350> right<00:04:18.590> now<00:04:19.150> just<00:04:20.150> seeing

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
I'll start off right now just seeing

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
what I get initially just set the insert

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.400 
what I get initially just set the insert
in<00:04:25.330> set<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.449> reeds<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.870> push<00:04:27.110> them<00:04:27.289> all<00:04:27.380> the

in set the reeds in push them all the
way<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.740> back<00:04:28.240> I've<00:04:29.240> pre-cut<00:04:29.630> them<00:04:30.729> I'll

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
way to the back I've pre-cut them I'll

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.550 
way to the back I've pre-cut them I'll
slide<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.270> cork<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:34.810> cork<00:04:35.810> fits<00:04:36.110> somewhat

important<00:04:37.120> now<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.330> I've<00:04:38.419> set<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.840> reeds

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
important now that I've set the reeds

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.760 
important now that I've set the reeds
what<00:04:40.099> I'll<00:04:40.190> do<00:04:40.340> is<00:04:40.490> I'll<00:04:40.639> grab<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.910> barrel<00:04:41.300> now

what I'll do is I'll grab a barrel now
try<00:04:42.770> blowing<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.930> like<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.020> blow<00:04:45.200> one

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
try blowing it I like to blow one

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.670 
try blowing it I like to blow one
particular<00:04:46.220> barrel<00:04:46.700> all<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:46.970> time<00:04:47.620> just<00:04:48.620> so

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
particular barrel all the time just so

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.409 
particular barrel all the time just so
I'm<00:04:48.800> not<00:04:48.919> blowing<00:04:49.460> into<00:04:49.639> every<00:04:49.880> single<00:04:50.090> call<00:04:50.389> I

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
I'm not blowing into every single call I

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.150 
I'm not blowing into every single call I
make<00:04:51.729> just<00:04:52.729> insert<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.300> in<00:04:53.479> I'll<00:04:54.470> try<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:54.860> and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
make just insert it in I'll try it and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.500 
make just insert it in I'll try it and
see<00:04:55.250> what<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.580> sounds<00:04:55.820> like<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:56.120> adjust<00:04:56.419> from

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
see what it sounds like and adjust from

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:06.100 
see what it sounds like and adjust from
there

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.020 

okay<00:05:07.110> from<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.890> can<00:05:08.100> make<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> decision<00:05:08.850> now

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
okay from that I can make a decision now

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.410 
okay from that I can make a decision now
that<00:05:09.540> what<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.840> do<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.800> call<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.820> me<00:05:11.940> sounds<00:05:12.330> a

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
that what to do that call to me sounds a

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.150 
that what to do that call to me sounds a
little<00:05:12.660> high<00:05:13.530> what<00:05:14.520> I'll<00:05:14.640> probably<00:05:14.790> do<00:05:15.180> is

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
little high what I'll probably do is

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.190 
little high what I'll probably do is
take<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.280> reeds<00:05:17.550> out<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.610> will<00:05:20.790> actually

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
take the reeds out and I will actually

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.100 
take the reeds out and I will actually
scrape<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.530> tone<00:05:22.770> board<00:05:23.660> just<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.750> little<00:05:24.990> bit

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
scrape the tone board just a little bit

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.790 
scrape the tone board just a little bit
on<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.320> surface<00:05:26.510> just<00:05:27.510> kind<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.840> increasing

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
on the surface just kind of increasing
