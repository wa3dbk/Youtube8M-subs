00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right so this is the catapult I

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.809 
all right so this is the catapult I
built<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.510> it's<00:00:04.140> made<00:00:05.069> out<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.549> what

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
built here it's made out of what

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.639 
built here it's made out of what
basically<00:00:06.240> it's<00:00:06.690> pretty<00:00:06.810> simple<00:00:07.200> like<00:00:07.350> mr.

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
basically it's pretty simple like mr.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.000 
basically it's pretty simple like mr.
Johnston's<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.970> turn<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> ropes<00:00:09.679> down<00:00:10.679> there

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
Johnston's you turn the ropes down there

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.519 
Johnston's you turn the ropes down there
over<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.590> you<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> little<00:00:14.040> bit<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> a

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
over here you have a little bit of a

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.109 
over here you have a little bit of a
firing<00:00:16.529> system<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> pull<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.460> pin<00:00:17.699> out<00:00:17.850> like

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
firing system and pull this pin out like

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.590 
firing system and pull this pin out like
that<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.130> Mick's<00:00:20.130> arm<00:00:20.369> go<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.330> fast

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
that and Mick's arm go up really fast

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.590 
that and Mick's arm go up really fast
and<00:00:22.130> I'm<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.369> shooting<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.850> small

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and I'm going to be shooting a small

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
and I'm going to be shooting a small
little<00:00:24.869> basketball<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> sling

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
little basketball here it's in the sling

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.339 
little basketball here it's in the sling
and<00:00:26.910> when<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.449> gets<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> top<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> swing

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and when it gets to the top of the swing

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.519 
and when it gets to the top of the swing
this<00:00:29.099> rope<00:00:29.400> comes<00:00:30.029> off<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> releases<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this rope comes off and releases the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:42.369 
this rope comes off and releases the
ball<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> when<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.390> set<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> tripod<00:00:34.050> here

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.540 

this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.890> soccer<00:00:44.100> ball<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
this is a different soccer ball that I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
this is a different soccer ball that I
showed<00:00:44.789> earlier<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
showed earlier so here it is and as you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.590 
showed earlier so here it is and as you
can<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.570> that's<00:00:49.399> pretty<00:00:50.399> far<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:51.180> way<00:00:51.420> down

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
can see that's pretty far from way down

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229 
can see that's pretty far from way down
there<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.170> started<00:00:52.789> all<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
there where we started all right so the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.520 
there where we started all right so the
next<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> shooting<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
next thing we're going to be shooting is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
next thing we're going to be shooting is
or<00:00:56.430> our<00:00:57.180> two<00:00:58.050> tennis<00:00:58.379> balls<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.780> one<00:01:00.780> thing<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
or our two tennis balls and one thing I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
or our two tennis balls and one thing I
forgot<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> mention<00:01:01.410> earlier<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.340> one

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
forgot to mention earlier is that one

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
forgot to mention earlier is that one
actually<00:01:02.910> pull<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> arm<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
actually pull this arm down here it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.960 
actually pull this arm down here it
takes<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> lot<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> force<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
takes a lot of force I have to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
takes a lot of force I have to
practically<00:01:06.450> hang<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> end<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
practically hang on the end of it and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.800 
practically hang on the end of it and
that's<00:01:07.650> six<00:01:07.920> feet<00:01:08.100> away<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.760> fulcrum<00:01:09.600> if

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that's six feet away from the fulcrum if

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.060 
that's six feet away from the fulcrum if
you<00:01:09.930> want<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> speak<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> physics<00:01:10.740> terms

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:34.899 

you

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.450 

these<00:01:35.780> ones<00:01:35.990> will<00:01:36.109> go<00:01:36.170> far

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.599 

the<00:01:43.030> tennis<00:01:43.359> balls<00:01:43.539> tend<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:44.020> fire<00:01:44.350> lower<00:01:45.280> and

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
the tennis balls tend to fire lower and

00:01:45.609 --> 00:02:01.410 
the tennis balls tend to fire lower and
not<00:01:45.729> arc<00:01:46.000> as<00:01:46.240> much<00:01:46.479> as<00:01:46.659> heavier<00:01:46.990> objects<00:02:00.420> all

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
not arc as much as heavier objects all

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.609 
not arc as much as heavier objects all
right<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.719> noticed<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.200> was<00:02:02.319> a<00:02:02.350> little<00:02:02.500> bit

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
right so I noticed it was a little bit

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.199 
right so I noticed it was a little bit
weak<00:02:02.799> after<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.280> table<00:02:03.490> tennis<00:02:03.789> ball<00:02:03.969> so<00:02:04.149> I'm

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
weak after that table tennis ball so I'm

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.279 
weak after that table tennis ball so I'm
going<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.390> torque<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:07.600> use<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.019> car

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
going to torque it if we use the car

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:17.490 
going to torque it if we use the car
like<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:15.540> okay<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.780> next<00:02:16.989> thing<00:02:17.200> we're

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
like this okay so the next thing we're

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.210 
like this okay so the next thing we're
going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.650> shoot<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.880> lacrosse<00:02:19.120> ball<00:02:19.239> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
going to shoot is a lacrosse ball I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.199 
going to shoot is a lacrosse ball I
found<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.430> at<00:02:21.670> school

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
found this at school

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.780 
found this at school
and<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:24.069> pretty<00:02:24.220> fun<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.670> goes

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and it's pretty fun because it goes

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.270 
and it's pretty fun because it goes
really<00:02:24.940> far<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.540> weighs<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> lot<00:02:26.280> I'm

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
really far and it weighs a lot I'm

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.470 
really far and it weighs a lot I'm
probably<00:02:27.459> not<00:02:27.640> even<00:02:27.700> gonna<00:02:27.910> be<00:02:28.060> able<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.239> see

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
probably not even gonna be able to see

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.910 
probably not even gonna be able to see
it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:39.539 
it
alright<00:02:30.540> three<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:37.720> went<00:02:38.290> through<00:02:38.560> two<00:02:39.250> trees

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
alright three I went through two trees

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.289 
alright three I went through two trees
and<00:02:39.790> kept<00:02:39.970> going

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
and kept going

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.990 
and kept going
it's<00:02:40.720> probably<00:02:41.349> somewhere<00:02:42.239> way<00:02:43.239> over<00:02:43.510> here<00:02:45.000> or

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
it's probably somewhere way over here or

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's probably somewhere way over here or
not

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
not

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.259 
not
alright<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.889> lacrosse<00:02:48.190> ball<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.730> gone<00:02:49.030> he

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
alright so the lacrosse ball is gone he

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.080 
alright so the lacrosse ball is gone he
went<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.840> way<00:02:50.069> really<00:02:51.069> far<00:02:51.400> but<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.760> managed

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
went that way really far but I managed

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.520 
went that way really far but I managed
to<00:02:52.120> find<00:02:52.299> one<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.600> tennis<00:02:52.840> balls<00:02:53.019> we<00:02:53.200> shot

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
to find one the tennis balls we shot

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.460 
to find one the tennis balls we shot
earlier<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.670> it's<00:02:55.329> basically<00:02:55.690> how<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.049> works

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
earlier so it's basically how it works

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.460 
earlier so it's basically how it works
um<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.819> replica<00:02:58.569> Roman<00:02:58.959> catapult
