00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.130 
generally like to use the crushed garlic
because<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.270> easier<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> spread<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because it's really easier to spread and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.300 
because it's really easier to spread and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.160 
throughout each piece of meat then you
go<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.219> crushed<00:01:56.490> black<00:01:56.610> pepper<00:01:57.170> all

doesn't really mean anything

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.230 
doesn't really mean anything
until<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.540> get<00:02:04.689> out<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.930> goods<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:07.180> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
Tang eNOS to the ribs but actually I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.290 
Tang eNOS to the ribs but actually I
think<00:02:26.739> also<00:02:27.069> helps<00:02:27.519> kind<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.819> break<00:02:28.030> down<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
think also helps kind of break down the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.080 
think also helps kind of break down the
ribs<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.230> little<00:02:29.260> bit<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.459> cover<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
ribs a little bit so you cover the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.449 
ribs a little bit so you cover the
broiling<00:02:31.330> pan<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.840> foil<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.310> just

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
broiling pan in foil and then you just

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.040 
broiling pan in foil and then you just
put<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.790> your<00:02:33.970> oven<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.540> literally<00:02:34.870> will

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
put it in your oven and I literally will

put it in your oven and I literally will
turn<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.319> oven<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.920> lowest<00:02:36.040> heat<00:02:36.430> that

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
turn the oven on the lowest heat that

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.460 
turn the oven on the lowest heat that
can<00:02:36.640> possibly<00:02:36.790> do<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.930> way<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.350> know

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
can possibly do the way that you know

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.350 
can possibly do the way that you know

the ribs are ready is a simple
tried-and-true<00:02:40.930> process<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.620> pull<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
tried-and-true process so you pull it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.710 
tried-and-true process so you pull it
out<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.250> oven<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.209> literally<00:02:43.450> grab<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
out of the oven and you literally grab a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.850 
is key too because you are going to have

really moist meat on a bone that's gonna

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.620 
really moist meat on a bone that's gonna
be<00:03:06.010> falling<00:03:06.280> off<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.120> have<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.510> do

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
be falling off so you have to do

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.120 
be falling off so you have to do
something<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.049> lot<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.260> grill<00:03:08.560> people<00:03:08.859> think<00:03:09.040> is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
something a lot of grill people think is

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.610 
something a lot of grill people think is
taboo<00:03:09.519> but<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.239> gotta<00:03:10.450> lay<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.109> little<00:03:11.290> foil

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
taboo but you gotta lay a little foil

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.900 
taboo but you gotta lay a little foil
down<00:03:11.799> on<00:03:12.070> your<00:03:12.190> grill<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.549> can<00:03:12.730> actually

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
down on your grill so you can actually

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.550 
down on your grill so you can actually
salvage<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.780> goodness<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.320> doesn't

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
salvage all that goodness and it doesn't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.800 
salvage all that goodness and it doesn't
fall<00:03:14.739> down<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.160> coals<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.510> need<00:03:16.630> two

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
fall down to the coals so you need two

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.050 
fall down to the coals so you need two
minutes<00:03:17.109> on<00:03:17.200> each<00:03:17.230> side<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.980> literally<00:03:18.820> your

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
minutes on each side so literally your

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.240 
minutes on each side so literally your
grill<00:03:19.329> should<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.630> piping<00:03:20.019> hot<00:03:20.230> probably<00:03:20.620> 450
