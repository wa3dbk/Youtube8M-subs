00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.160
 great victory of FC Barcelona in the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.809
 rose garden in the return meeting of 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.330
 the quarterfinals of the cup of his 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.940
 majesty the king the barça and málaga 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.460
 they came from 2 to 2 of the way in the camp 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.600
 nou and the barcelona that I needed to 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.190
 Mark did it right away in the 9th minute 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.650
 he was already ahead on the scoreboard the 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.260
 Team of Jordi Roura today substitute of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.930
 tito vilanova on the Barça bench 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.270
 a barça 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 already started the game dominating 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.790
 and as we said, he would score his first goal 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.250
 in the 9th minute with this elaborate play 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.560
 for the azulgranas 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.450
 and it would end with this head shot of 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.320
 I ask the action of xavi to the limit of 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.270
 out of the game alves in fact gives the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.250
 feeling that the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.080
 Brazilian and measured for the center 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.480
 pedro head the canary scoring the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.360
 0 to 1 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.980
 Malaga's response was immediate 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.659
 that the players of the barça claimed 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.030
 a hand 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.050
 of seva that is the one that ends up delivering 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 the ball doubt doubt for joaquin and 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.159
 the former betis player 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.590
 get to score 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.270
 adjusting the ball to the stick and matching 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 the clash against the Catalans 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 it marked the tie the betis in a first 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.770
 period or rather the málaga 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.510
 the ex of the betis did it in a first 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.860
 really spectacular part here we see 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.409
 hand 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.380
 clear 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.249
 of seva that takes to take that 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.460
 ball the draw to one in the 12th minute and 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.980
 we see the dry finish 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.470
 Malaga 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.930
 it was thanks to the goal to stretch a 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.050
 Little more to get rid of the pressure 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.540
 azulgrana and claimed a penalty in this 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.270
 gerard pique action to the ground the ball 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.990
 it seems that it plays in the whole central 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.660
 azulgrana and leaves fired in the second 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.980
 controversial hand of the match if the referee 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.320
 I would have called this penalty too 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.170
 I should have invalidated the action 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.760
 of the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.660
 and this is an action in which messi 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.660
 is about to mark 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.750
 first part of a lot of tension 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.240
 and with a barcelona 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.750
 as usual, it's usually put up in 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.430
 a great game of andré iniesta 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.600
 who returned to make a meeting 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.980
 very complete the fountain 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.980
 they end up watching a ball at the post 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.390
 here we see how it ends up sending this 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.390
 ball up 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.329
 of the pitch 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.819
 also up Malaga in this first 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.040
 period of alternatives and see here 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.300
 he painted how fast reflexes he has 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 that be 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.980
 to avoid 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.490
 to receive 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.330
 one more goal 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.330
 it would have been him 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.360
 second of the Andalusians 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.050
 in the first period the barcelona had 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.960
 opportunities for 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.550
 get away with advantage and for example 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.000
 he has to finish taking the ball 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.000
 wellington 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.110
 very fast wellington avoiding that 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.110
 ball will approach the goal of 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.280
 Carlos Kameni first half of tension 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.290
 with many yellow and second period 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.780
 in which Barcelona would score again 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.250
 very soon I would do it and that with this ball 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.890
 receiving 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.930
 within the control area to the chest and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.200
 left - footed shot from 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.319
 recent dad pique coming out in position 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.319
 regulatory 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.750
 logically I dedicate 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.390
 the goal to his newborn son on 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.340
 barcelona that got the 1 to 2 and 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.579
 he had great opportunities and above all 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.700
 a lot of domination and siege 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.430
 1 to 3 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.470
 knew the club that put a third goal 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.200
 it was very decisive in this match 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.200
 because it forced the Malaga to have to 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.879
 dial at least 2 to pass the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.439
 elimination from 3 to 3 would no longer be useful 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.530
 to go to the extension 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:43.289
 this is the play from 2 to 2 with the goal 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.560
 from roque santacruz the dry shot to the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.400
 right stick 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.400
 Paraguayan finish 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.530
 equaling the Mascheran party was 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.840
 he has a yellow one because the referee does not 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.099
 saw this clear wellington aggression at 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.099
 thigh of 6 fabregas 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.500
 in the play that continued he finished marking 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.509
 the Andalusian set the protests of the 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.020
 little boss, that cardboard was worth it 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.860
 yellow but the game would change with 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.860
 2 to 2 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.969
 especially with this goal 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.790
 with the 2 to 3 of iniesta the barça 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.800
 I got the big goal 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.950
 to force the Malaga to have to put 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.720
 two goals to pass something that already 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.580
 It was starting to be difficult because they were leaving 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.030
 finishing the minutes the play is 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.950
 extraordinary of 6 monumental fabregas 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.250
 the ex of the arsenal and how do you solve with 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.670
 little bird included the one of fuentealbilla 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.670
 advance now 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.980
 got to mark a room ol 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.980
 in the minute 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.340
 almost 40 to notice 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.840
 a blunt victory we see again 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.970
 the action in the center from the right 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.140
 and header mincing the ball 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.430
 almost to the stick of leo messi the barça 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.440
 closed the meeting and messi was 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.760
 replaced it seems that with some problem 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.530
 muscular some annoyance came thiago 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.410
 to replace him and still see the ones 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.400
 had the Barcelona to even have 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.370
 scored from 2 to 5 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.680
 the club in a final half hour of 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.750
 second sublime period is over 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.639
 leading the match and the tie 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.940
 Real Madrid awaits in the semifinals 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.889
 after the 2 to 2 of the first leg at camp nou 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.070
 the club managed to win in the return to 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:43.980
 final in the team victory rose garden 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:47.300
 from jordi roura málaga 2 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.300
