00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's shot at that slow motion and the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
material and I think if you were to do

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.040 
material and I think if you were to do
something<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.360> Batman<00:03:03.840> V<00:03:03.870> Superman

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
he would make it as close to the source

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.020 
he would make it as close to the source
material<00:03:06.450> as<00:03:06.930> possible<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.280> seeing<00:03:08.610> Jared

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
material as possible so seeing Jared

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.240

during this nightmare now I might
mention<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.590> source<00:03:28.890> tells<00:03:29.280> j.r<00:03:29.580> or

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
mention that the source tells j.r or

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.650 
mention that the source tells j.r or
that<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.870> fact<00:03:30.900> Jason<00:03:31.890> Todd<00:03:32.430> Robin<00:03:33.150> that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that it is in fact Jason Todd Robin that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.290 
that it is in fact Jason Todd Robin that
dies<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.860> scene<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.489> they<00:03:35.640> make<00:03:35.880> note<00:03:36.270> of

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
dies in this scene and they make note of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.540 
dies in this scene and they make note of
that<00:03:36.750> now<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.290> reason<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:37.890> put<00:03:38.130> emphasis

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
that now the reason that I put emphasis

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.520 
that now the reason that I put emphasis
on<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.970> because<00:03:39.270> when<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> made<00:03:40.080> my<00:03:40.110> red

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
on that is because when I made my red

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.920 
on that is because when I made my red
hood<00:03:40.770> theory<00:03:41.220> video<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.790> couple<00:03:41.940> days<00:03:42.510> ago<00:03:42.540> or

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
hood theory video a couple days ago or

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.600 
hood theory video a couple days ago or
about<00:03:43.140> like<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.350> week<00:03:43.380> ago<00:03:43.680> some<00:03:44.280> people<00:03:44.520> were

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
about like a week ago some people were

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.150 
about like a week ago some people were
telling<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.209> caboose<00:03:46.140> there's<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.860> leak

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
telling me I caboose there's this leak

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.490 
telling me I caboose there's this leak
set<00:03:47.489> photo<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.060> says<00:03:48.270> Dick<00:03:48.540> Grayson<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.290> dead

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
set photo that says Dick Grayson is dead

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.930 
set photo that says Dick Grayson is dead
so<00:03:49.950> they're<00:03:50.100> probably<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.580> going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.850> make

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
so they're probably just going to make

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.370 
so they're probably just going to make
it<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.330> Dick<00:03:51.540> Grayson<00:03:51.959> was<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.230> only

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
it so that Dick Grayson was the only

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.040 
it so that Dick Grayson was the only
Robin<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.040> he's<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:53.820> who<00:03:53.940> dies<00:03:54.150> doesn't

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
Robin and he's the one who dies doesn't

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.050 
Robin and he's the one who dies doesn't
seem<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.560> true<00:03:55.920> which<00:03:56.489> again<00:03:56.790> brings

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
seem like that's true which again brings

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.720 
seem like that's true which again brings
me<00:03:57.630> back<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:58.020> Zack<00:03:58.260> Snyder<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.950> how<00:03:59.310> much<00:03:59.520> he

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
me back to Zack Snyder and how much he

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.790 
me back to Zack Snyder and how much he
respects<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.360> source<00:04:00.630> material<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.680> he

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
respects the source material I think he

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.280 
respects the source material I think he
respects<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.340> way<00:04:02.610> too<00:04:02.670> much<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.540> change<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:04.020> so

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
respects it way too much to change it so

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.070 
respects it way too much to change it so
so<00:04:05.010> drastically<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:06.330> where<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.660> ends<00:04:06.959> up<00:04:07.020> being

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
so drastically to where it ends up being

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.620 
so drastically to where it ends up being
Dick<00:04:07.890> Grayson<00:04:08.459> who<00:04:08.670> turns<00:04:08.940> into<00:04:09.120> Red<00:04:09.330> Hood<00:04:09.510> or

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
Dick Grayson who turns into Red Hood or

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.840 
Dick Grayson who turns into Red Hood or
even<00:04:10.080> just<00:04:10.110> ends<00:04:10.800> up<00:04:10.860> being<00:04:11.100> Dick<00:04:11.370> Grayson<00:04:11.820> the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
even just ends up being Dick Grayson the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.690 
even just ends up being Dick Grayson the
Robin<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.540> dies<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.200> Batman<00:04:13.920> not<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.400> any

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
going too far deep into it and taking up

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.190 
going too far deep into it and taking up
too<00:04:44.370> much<00:04:44.400> time<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.180> film<00:04:45.480> just<00:04:45.960> make<00:04:46.170> it

too much time in the film just make it

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.780 
too much time in the film just make it
be<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> nightmare<00:04:46.740> sequence<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.400> Bruce<00:04:47.610> Wayne

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
be a nightmare sequence that Bruce Wayne

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.790 
be a nightmare sequence that Bruce Wayne
goes<00:04:48.030> through<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.510> we<00:04:48.780> see<00:04:48.990> all<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.440> tragic

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
goes through and we see all the tragic

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.950 
goes through and we see all the tragic
events<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.490> happened<00:04:50.940> in<00:04:51.120> his<00:04:51.300> lifetime<00:04:51.540> as

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
events that happened in his lifetime as

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.040 
events that happened in his lifetime as
Bruce<00:04:52.500> Wayne<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:53.010> Batman<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:54.270> think<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.870> fits

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
Bruce Wayne and Batman I think it fits

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.480 
Bruce Wayne and Batman I think it fits
perfectly<00:04:55.140> in<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.770> film<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.070> think<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.370> would

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
perfectly in the film I think it would

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.070 
perfectly in the film I think it would
work<00:04:56.520> perfectly<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.390> film<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.810> I'm

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
work perfectly in the film and I'm

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.590 
work perfectly in the film and I'm
really<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:59.010> to<00:04:59.130> be<00:04:59.310> excited<00:04:59.880> if<00:05:00.000> that's

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
really going to be excited if that's

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.630 
really going to be excited if that's
what<00:05:00.810> happens<00:05:01.230> in<00:05:01.410> Batman<00:05:01.980> V<00:05:02.010> Superman<00:05:02.130> but

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640
