00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.119
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.849
 go today we will introduce you 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:19.060
 a mode simply the jaguar class 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.769
 685 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.390
 so who has been converted so I 'm going 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.400
 explain a little bit was converted by 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.520
 daniel 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.750
 so he left the credits of the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.619
 person they had made on the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.450
 2013 and so kim the man entrusted it all 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.790
 just for the webshop so I'm going 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.210
 you present it here so it's a very 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 very good machine nothing to say he has 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.510
 super worked well 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.680
 so he added for 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 hang the trailer on the back 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 and a lot of things there but it's 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.770
 typically by that if you look good 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.680
 and even so that's what I tell you 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.660
 I said go anyway super pole so 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.020
 the cut that goes well with and we're going 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.480
 get in then let's go for a ride 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.870
 in so 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.320
 the steering wheel class inside we will say 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.240
 it's classy it's pretty cool there 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.340
 no opening of doors are not two 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.540
 do not look for more easy going for 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.850
 the moment it is a first version 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.080
 if one accelerates sends the revs account and 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.509
 acceleration that works that's 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.180
 so apparently by cons I do not see 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.850
 the acronyms like the retro wings I'm going 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.770
 read about sigas yeah good bah I 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.770
 may not know a shell from him 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.370
 the lights are selling well 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.360
 ferriÃ¨res 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.870
 so I have nothing to touch 1 the mode 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 is like he is and then or so 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.350
 I have a strong 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.260
 it's a good vehicle we're going 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 go to see him in operation then 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.720
 I explain it's still a version 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.140
 one so and so I respected a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.390
 what did the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.090
 the modder so I just did that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.080
 loichat so we will see and go so that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.080
 rather not too bad 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 yeah I'm going through worry 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.170
 we try to fill it up a bit 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.709
 really see a little what it gives 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.600
 so I also see you start 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.770
 I had already used a little bit so 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.770
 dirty a little if you look good 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.340
 so it fills up well there 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.480
 it's not bad the system with the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:51.010
 trailer in the back good or so 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.010
 some people propose some emotion 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.620
 but I like this model 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.620
 is rather nice 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.830
 I think he did well anyway 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.230
 we'll get inside for you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.230
 show 6 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.420
 like no full option no stuff 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.220
 phenomenal 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.920
 ah good like his first version 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.440
 maybe they're improving afterwards 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.040
 I wish him 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 that would be cool 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.610
 that would be cool 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.510
 we will look a little bit before 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.920
 it's filling 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.920
 toulouse this moment but it fills up 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.400
 and we can see traces 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 we will see how to know if the rooms 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.870
 it stops me seconds for you 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.870
 show 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.910
 Here we see indeed we see that it 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.910
 begins to get dirty 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.819
 so she's at the challow so here 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.560
 it will be available 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.799
 in the description having to read in the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.799
 description 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.260

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.040

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.670
 part of us 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.389
 but share it because it was not 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.010
 an obligation 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.720

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.930
 daniel 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.219
 or 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.930
 to work we start to get dirty 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.930
 start to get dirty girlfriend 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.340
 so for those who know this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.480
 machine there 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.220
 I believe that it is to be masses to 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.650
 the back but I'm not sure I'm going 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.980
 not say anything stupid I som 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.980

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.590
 oh well she is clean and nick 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.449
 but see no problem for the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.830
 filling it is very very well 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.779
 because it is very practical a trailer to 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.699
 the back frankly go it's nickel 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.990
 is not bothered after leading with a 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.819
 tractor you go the empty ones and they 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.210
 take you a trailer and that's it 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.210

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.389
