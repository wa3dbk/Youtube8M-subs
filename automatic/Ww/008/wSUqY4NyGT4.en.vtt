00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
layout that's really one of the reasons

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.620 
layout that's really one of the reasons
why<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.000> lot<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.270> people<00:01:34.539> I

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
why that I and and a lot of people I

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.050 
why that I and and a lot of people I
know<00:01:34.659> preferred<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.590> space<00:01:35.800> explorer<00:01:36.399> over

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
know preferred the space explorer over

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.150 
know preferred the space explorer over
the<00:01:37.209> space<00:01:37.420> pilot<00:01:37.840> Pro<00:01:38.080> was<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.860> button

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
the space pilot Pro was the button

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.059 
the space pilot Pro was the button
layout<00:01:39.489> so<00:01:40.390> they<00:01:40.509> basically<00:01:40.929> kept<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.800> same

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
layout so they basically kept the same

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.010 
layout so they basically kept the same
layout<00:01:42.340> but<00:01:43.209> they<00:01:43.300> made<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.630> buttons<00:01:43.929> a

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
layout but they made the buttons a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.809 
layout but they made the buttons a
little<00:01:44.289> bit<00:01:44.380> larger<00:01:44.739> so<00:01:44.920> that's<00:01:45.459> something<00:01:45.729> I

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
little bit larger so that's something I

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.600 
little bit larger so that's something I
really<00:01:46.149> like<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:47.050> next<00:01:47.349> thing<00:01:47.560> are<00:01:48.399> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
really like the next thing are the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.520 
really like the next thing are the
keyboard<00:01:48.880> style<00:01:49.450> haptics<00:01:49.989> now<00:01:50.289> basically

keyboard style haptics now basically

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
what that means is that the keys feel

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.940 
what that means is that the keys feel
and<00:01:53.830> react<00:01:54.250> like<00:01:54.849> regular<00:01:55.330> keyboard<00:01:55.840> keys<00:01:56.140> the

used a 3d mouse you really understand
the<00:02:30.099> value<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.610> having<00:02:30.790> one<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.150> these<00:02:31.269> devices

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the value of having one of these devices

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.979 
the value of having one of these devices
in<00:02:32.410> your<00:02:32.560> CAD<00:02:32.800> work<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.400> couple<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.239> things<00:02:34.629> that

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
in your CAD work a couple of things that

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.619 
in your CAD work a couple of things that
aren't<00:02:35.440> necessarily<00:02:36.069> bad<00:02:36.760> things<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.330> just

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
aren't necessarily bad things is just

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.690 
aren't necessarily bad things is just
kind<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.959> little<00:02:38.170> quirks<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.160> we<00:02:39.340> notice

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
kind of little quirks that we notice

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.420 
kind of little quirks that we notice
were<00:02:40.390> one<00:02:40.930> was<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.590> control<00:02:42.070> button

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
were one was the control button

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.340 
were one was the control button
placement<00:02:42.700> now<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.450> control<00:02:43.870> button<00:02:44.170> is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
placement now the control button is

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.600 
placement now the control button is
probably<00:02:44.830> one<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.640> most<00:02:45.790> important<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
probably one of the most important and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.610 
probably one of the most important and
one<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.820> most<00:02:47.030> used<00:02:47.450> buttons<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> device

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
one of the most used buttons on a device

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.220 
one of the most used buttons on a device
like<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:50.270> know<00:02:50.390> when<00:02:50.540> you're<00:02:50.660> working

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
like this you know when you're working

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.720 
like this you know when you're working
in<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.500> large<00:02:51.740> assembly<00:02:52.070> or<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.520> really

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
in a large assembly or a really

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.650 
in a large assembly or a really
complicated<00:02:54.070> part<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.430> you're<00:02:56.180> needing<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
complicated part and you're needing to

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.260 
complicated part and you're needing to
select<00:02:57.050> edges<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.590> vertices<00:02:57.650> or<00:02:58.460> components

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
select edges and vertices or components

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.110 
select edges and vertices or components
you<00:02:59.900> really<00:03:00.350> need<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.620> be<00:03:00.710> able<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.040> find<00:03:01.430> that

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you really need to be able to find that

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.720 
you really need to be able to find that
control<00:03:02.570> button<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.310> be<00:03:04.460> able<00:03:04.550> to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
control button and you know be able to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.240 
control button and you know be able to
use<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.120> easily<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.130> just

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
use it easily and so that was just

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.410 
use it easily and so that was just
something<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.700> kind<00:03:07.970> of<00:03:08.030> noticed<00:03:08.300> that

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
something that I kind of noticed that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.540 
something that I kind of noticed that
the<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.960> control<00:03:09.350> button<00:03:09.680> felt<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.010> little<00:03:10.250> bit

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
the the control button felt a little bit

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.750 
the the control button felt a little bit
cramped<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.540> terms<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.500> know<00:03:12.760> activating

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
cramped in terms of you know activating

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.520 
cramped in terms of you know activating
that<00:03:13.880> button<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.840> other<00:03:14.959> part<00:03:15.410> was

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
that button and the other part was

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.580 
that button and the other part was
finding<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.459> old<00:03:16.870> space<00:03:17.870> Explorer<00:03:18.410> it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
finding it on the old space Explorer it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.400 
finding it on the old space Explorer it
had<00:03:18.770> this<00:03:18.920> little<00:03:19.160> nub<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.570> guess<00:03:21.050> it<00:03:21.170> was<00:03:21.260> kind

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
had this little nub I guess it was kind

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.680 
had this little nub I guess it was kind
of<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:21.560> Braille<00:03:22.010> for<00:03:22.490> those<00:03:22.700> CAD<00:03:23.060> users<00:03:23.480> it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
of like Braille for those CAD users it

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.080 
of like Braille for those CAD users it
just<00:03:23.900> refused<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.530> not<00:03:25.070> look<00:03:25.520> away<00:03:25.730> from<00:03:25.790> their

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
just refused to not look away from their

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.510 
just refused to not look away from their
screen<00:03:26.420> but<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.900> mean<00:03:27.290> really<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.280> don't

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
screen but I mean really you you don't

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.010 
screen but I mean really you you don't
want<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.209> look<00:03:29.330> away<00:03:29.630> from<00:03:29.690> your

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
want to have to look away from your

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.440 
want to have to look away from your
screen<00:03:30.380> every<00:03:31.250> time<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.880> need<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.060> press

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
screen every time you you need to press

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.650 
screen every time you you need to press
a<00:03:32.480> button<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:33.680> your<00:03:33.980> device<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.510> was

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
a button on your device and so that was

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.910 
a button on your device and so that was
just<00:03:35.690> something<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.380> found<00:03:36.770> really

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
just something that I found really

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.830 
just something that I found really
helpful<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.940> don't<00:03:38.330> know<00:03:38.390> maybe<00:03:38.570> that's

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
helpful so I don't know maybe that's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.090 
helpful so I don't know maybe that's
just<00:03:39.050> something<00:03:39.380> in<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.500> revision<00:03:39.830> they

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
just something in the revision they

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.130 
just something in the revision they
could<00:03:40.250> do<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.360> button<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.780> make<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:41.959> a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
could do to that button to make it a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.979 
could do to that button to make it a
little<00:03:42.290> bit<00:03:42.530> easier<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:43.370> find<00:03:44.030> now<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.630> other

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
little bit easier to find now the other

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.320 
little bit easier to find now the other
thing<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.470> noticed<00:03:45.890> was<00:03:46.459> regarding<00:03:47.030> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
thing that we noticed was regarding the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.380 
thing that we noticed was regarding the
menu<00:03:48.080> button<00:03:48.500> placement<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.340> again<00:03:50.060> in<00:03:50.300> the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
menu button placement and again in the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.320 
menu button placement and again in the
limited<00:03:50.780> time<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> had<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:52.730> work<00:03:53.060> with<00:03:53.120> the

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
limited time that I had to work with the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.150 
limited time that I had to work with the
device<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.870> noticed<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.590> menu<00:03:54.769> button

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
device I noticed that the menu button

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.229 
device I noticed that the menu button
lined<00:03:55.519> up<00:03:56.170> right<00:03:57.170> with<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.040> side<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.820> my<00:03:58.940> hand

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
lined up right with the side of my hand

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.289 
lined up right with the side of my hand
and<00:03:59.510> so<00:03:59.660> again<00:04:00.380> while<00:04:00.769> in<00:04:01.160> practice<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.120> never

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
and so again while in practice I never

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.860 
and so again while in practice I never
had<00:04:02.510> an<00:04:02.630> issue<00:04:02.920> activating<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.010> menu<00:04:04.250> button

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
had an issue activating the menu button

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.729 
had an issue activating the menu button
you<00:04:05.870> know<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:05.989> don't<00:04:06.200> know<00:04:06.260> maybe<00:04:06.410> if<00:04:06.620> you've

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
you know I don't know maybe if you've

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.680 
you know I don't know maybe if you've
got<00:04:06.920> ocher<00:04:07.250> hands<00:04:07.519> or<00:04:07.760> something<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.480> might

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
got ocher hands or something you might

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.600 
got ocher hands or something you might
run<00:04:08.870> into<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.260> issue<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:10.190> then<00:04:10.340> again

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
run into that issue but then again

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.430 
run into that issue but then again
they're<00:04:10.850> programmable<00:04:11.480> buttons<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.170> you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
they're programmable buttons so you

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.380 
they're programmable buttons so you
could<00:04:12.799> program<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.459> something<00:04:13.670> else<00:04:13.820> of

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
could program it to something else of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.800 
could program it to something else of
your<00:04:14.630> choice<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.799> then<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> last<00:04:16.340> thing<00:04:16.810> again

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810
