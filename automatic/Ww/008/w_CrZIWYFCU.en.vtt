00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:10.110
 here is the final part 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.340
 iron man what was wrong with from 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.950
 paper strengthened 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 these lines and already cuts are just 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.630
 grinder mask removable not yet 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.930
 I will betray I will not paint what 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.949
 most likely I will not level everything 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.769
 irregularities that were a lot because 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.769
 that I made a mistake this is his business 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.670
 strengthened the activity a little and a month so far 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.670
 he did all this outside 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.930
 advises you will do strengthen 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.680
 inside and not at all 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.030
 thin thin layer of putty outside 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.930
 when they will be like this 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.930
 spoiled small details 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.560
 here look everywhere such liquid already 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.580
 we collect the second mask this time not 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 iron man 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.820
 warrior if you remember his partner 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.800
 made eyes 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.009
 I will probably use it as 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:34.280
 lamp this mask on the head worn 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:37.820
 but the only thing that I didn't do 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:43.330
 rather again in this place it at 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:47.119
 railing is good either i will need 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.610
 circle and insert some kind of iron 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.840
 part of fluff 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.250
 then on the forager inside you found 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.140
 putty used on wood which 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.770
 she is terrible and I do not advise anyone 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.679
 use 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.920
 falls off falls off breaks 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.979
 should look found at all by 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.480
 fell off 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.860
 better not stingy and buy 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.610
 automotive putty which is much 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.810
 stronger will not fall off 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.810
 unfortunately more expensive 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.940
 These are probably the main shoals immediately 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.220
 I say not to do so like me 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.580
 saw off part of the mask 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.420
 what would be better to do it right away 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.030
 detachable insert some kind of tape 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.129
 which will prevent 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.709
 appreciate gluing just pinching them 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.410
 clothespin some to all this 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.239
 held on 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.120
 but do not stick together or a part but any and 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.250
 do not think at all to disassemble it and do 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.890
 whether I collapsible then why me then 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.040
 can the back of me too cut off there with 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.390
 head not very much and carry flows 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 if it can be made fixings
