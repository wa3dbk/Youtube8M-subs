this here you can see the back of the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.240 
this here you can see the back of the
truck<00:01:15.530> exciting<00:01:18.320> here's<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.440> box<00:01:19.800> i<00:01:20.040> think

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
truck exciting here's the box i think

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:30.170 
truck exciting here's the box i think
it's<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> charger<00:01:28.370> yes<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> stock

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
it's the charger yes it is the stock

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's the charger yes it is the stock
charger<00:01:30.620> but<00:01:31.620> it's<00:01:31.740> pretty<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:32.070> sucks<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
charger but it's pretty much sucks it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.200 
charger but it's pretty much sucks it
takes<00:01:33.360> about<00:01:33.480> six<00:01:34.050> hours<00:01:34.230> to<00:01:35.030> charge<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
takes about six hours to charge the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.180 
takes about six hours to charge the
battery<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.830> use<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
battery so what I want to use to that

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.850 
battery so what I want to use to that
would<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> normal<00:01:39.390> pic<00:01:39.750> target<00:01:42.620> Jay<00:01:43.620> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
would use a normal pic target Jay and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.980 
would use a normal pic target Jay and
here's<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.280> truck<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.320> ordered<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.040> red<00:01:47.250> one

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
here's the truck I ordered the red one

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.060 
here's the truck I ordered the red one
because<00:01:48.990> i<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.500> matches<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
because i think it's matches with the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.990 
because i think it's matches with the
all<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> red<00:01:51.210> links<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> stuff<00:01:52.670> we<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.820> come

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
support their screws yeah that's pretty

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.170 
support their screws yeah that's pretty
nice<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:22.070> will<00:02:23.070> probably<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.820> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
nice this will probably be the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.420 
nice this will probably be the
transmitter<00:02:27.019> yes<00:02:28.019> correct<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:31.430> 2.4

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
transmitter yes correct it's not a 2.4

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.040 
transmitter yes correct it's not a 2.4
gigahertz<00:02:32.459> into<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.269> normal<00:02:33.510> transmitter

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
gigahertz into the normal transmitter

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.190 
gigahertz into the normal transmitter
but<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.670> think<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> will<00:02:35.940> work<00:02:36.000> okay<00:02:38.959> as<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.140> said

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
but I think it will work okay as I said

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.800 
but I think it will work okay as I said
there's<00:02:40.920> no<00:02:41.100> battery<00:02:41.580> installed<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.630> well

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
there's no battery installed so well

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.120 
there's no battery installed so well
i'll<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.590> use<00:02:43.950> alive<00:02:44.910> box<00:02:46.220> yeah

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
i'll just use alive box yeah

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.590 
i'll just use alive box yeah

spots<00:03:39.860> here<00:03:40.040> for<00:03:40.450> extra<00:03:41.450> servo<00:03:41.840> but<00:03:42.800> I<00:03:43.040> won't

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
spots here for extra servo but I won't

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.220 
spots here for extra servo but I won't
use<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.820> because<00:03:44.120> if<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.510> have<00:03:44.660> two<00:03:44.810> servos

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
use it because if you have two servos

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.410 
use it because if you have two servos
they<00:03:45.650> never<00:03:45.830> worked<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.730> same<00:03:46.940> they<00:03:47.240> won't

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
they never worked the same they won't

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.580 
they never worked the same they won't
cooperate<00:03:48.220> that's<00:03:49.220> right<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:51.170> there's<00:03:51.380> all

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
cooperate that's right and there's all

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.350 
cooperate that's right and there's all
the<00:03:51.740> links<00:03:52.040> that's<00:03:52.670> why<00:03:52.820> that's<00:03:53.210> what<00:03:53.330> I

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
the links that's why that's what I

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.390 
the links that's why that's what I
measured<00:03:53.690> while<00:03:54.350> there<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.800> think<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.250> red

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
measured while there I think the red

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.360 
measured while there I think the red
body<00:03:55.610> matches<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:58.990> you<00:03:59.990> can<00:04:00.140> see<00:04:00.320> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
body matches and you can see the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.370 
body matches and you can see the
aluminum<00:04:01.370> blue<00:04:01.840> thing<00:04:02.840> here<00:04:03.670> maybe<00:04:04.670> I<00:04:05.380> know

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
aluminum blue thing here maybe I know

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.120 
aluminum blue thing here maybe I know
the<00:04:06.560> baddest<00:04:06.830> brittle<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.160> pretty<00:04:07.790> bad<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:12.130> if

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
the baddest brittle a pretty bad but if

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.410 
the baddest brittle a pretty bad but if
you<00:04:13.220> look<00:04:13.370> at<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.490> body<00:04:13.700> body<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.400> see<00:04:16.580> you

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
you look at a body body you can see you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.870 
you look at a body body you can see you
see<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.660> very<00:04:17.780> well<00:04:17.900> here<00:04:18.290> but<00:04:18.520> almost<00:04:19.520> almost

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
see it very well here but almost almost

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.070 
see it very well here but almost almost
can't<00:04:20.239> see<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.450> here<00:04:20.600> but<00:04:21.130> anyway<00:04:22.130> that's

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
can't see it here but anyway that's

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.670 
can't see it here but anyway that's
nothing<00:04:24.080> okay<00:04:24.290> so<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:24.980> here's<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:26.440> spot<00:04:27.440> where

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
nothing okay so so here's the spot where

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.380 
nothing okay so so here's the spot where
you<00:04:27.800> put<00:04:28.070> your<00:04:28.100> batteries<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.740> it's<00:04:31.130> actually

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
you put your batteries and it's actually

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.840 
you put your batteries and it's actually
it<00:04:32.390> won't<00:04:32.600> open<00:04:34.750> really<00:04:35.750> great<00:04:35.960> because<00:04:36.230> it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
it won't open really great because it

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.080 
it won't open really great because it
touches<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.030> tire<00:04:38.330> here<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:40.310> can<00:04:40.820> do<00:04:40.910> like

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
touches the tire here you can do like

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.270 
touches the tire here you can do like
that<00:04:42.280> well<00:04:43.280> that's<00:04:43.640> pretty<00:04:44.000> much<00:04:44.210> it
