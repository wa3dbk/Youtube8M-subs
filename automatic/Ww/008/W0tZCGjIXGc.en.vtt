00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
to point out is the fact that the red on

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.089 
to point out is the fact that the red on
the<00:02:42.879> rims<00:02:43.120> actually<00:02:43.810> matches<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.440> red<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
the rims actually matches the red on the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.979 
the rims actually matches the red on the
body<00:02:45.310> look<00:02:45.760> at<00:02:45.849> that<00:02:45.970> back<00:02:46.150> tire<00:02:46.420> there<00:02:46.750> you

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
body look at that back tire there you

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.500 
body look at that back tire there you
can<00:02:47.140> actually<00:02:47.319> see<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:48.040> glimpse<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.940> those<00:02:49.180> red

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
can actually see a glimpse of those red

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.930 
can actually see a glimpse of those red
lines<00:02:49.810> going<00:02:50.260> down<00:02:50.410> along<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.099> rims<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.849> I'm

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
lines going down along the rims so I'm

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.309 
lines going down along the rims so I'm
just<00:02:52.090> kind<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.299> hoping<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> rims<00:02:53.110> will

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
just kind of hoping that the rims will

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.170 
just kind of hoping that the rims will
be<00:02:53.440> automatically<00:02:54.069> always<00:02:54.519> set<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> match

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
be automatically always set up to match

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.210 
be automatically always set up to match

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
think that's a great little

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
think that's a great little
awesome<00:04:25.680> addition<00:04:25.890> so<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.670> next<00:04:26.790> shot<00:04:26.940> we

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
awesome addition so in the next shot we

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.410

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.940 
have the new eNOS Windsor and so today I
just<00:04:30.540> want<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.930> reiterate<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.590> fact<00:04:31.830> that

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
just want to reiterate the fact that

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.980 
just want to reiterate the fact that
this<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.340> one<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.880> eight<00:04:33.180> different<00:04:33.510> skins

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
this is one of eight different skins

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.200 
this is one of eight different skins
that<00:04:34.200> will<00:04:34.440> be<00:04:34.710> on<00:04:34.920> this<00:04:35.100> vehicle<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.730> it<00:04:36.060> is

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
that will be on this vehicle and it is

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.480 
that will be on this vehicle and it is
once<00:04:36.480> again<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.930> same<00:04:37.170> pattern<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.950> was<00:04:38.250> on

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
once again the same pattern that was on

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.030 
once again the same pattern that was on
the<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.850> previous<00:04:39.360> jacket<00:04:40.200> as<00:04:40.410> well<00:04:40.440> as<00:04:40.860> the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
the the previous jacket as well as the

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.460 
the the previous jacket as well as the
woman's<00:04:41.340> shirt<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.760> think<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:42.690> they<00:04:43.320> are

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
woman's shirt I think and so they are

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.620 
woman's shirt I think and so they are
really<00:04:43.770> really<00:04:44.610> wanting<00:04:44.970> us<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.150> notice<00:04:45.510> this

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
really really wanting us to notice this

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.150 
really really wanting us to notice this
pattern<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.200> some<00:04:46.380> reason<00:04:46.710> putting<00:04:46.950> it<00:04:47.070> on

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
pattern for some reason putting it on

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.950 
pattern for some reason putting it on
everything<00:04:47.580> but<00:04:48.270> they're<00:04:48.480> probably<00:04:48.690> just

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
everything but they're probably just

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.050 
everything but they're probably just
proud<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.650> new<00:04:49.890> high-end<00:04:50.250> pattern<00:04:50.880> that

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
proud of this new high-end pattern that

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.910 
proud of this new high-end pattern that
they<00:04:51.240> they<00:04:51.510> came<00:04:51.720> up<00:04:51.900> with<00:04:52.110> for<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.410> game<00:04:52.590> so

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
they they came up with for the game so

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.230 
they they came up with for the game so
anyways<00:04:53.280> they're<00:04:53.460> just<00:04:53.640> kind<00:04:53.760> of<00:04:53.820> slapping

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
anyways they're just kind of slapping

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.900 
anyways they're just kind of slapping
that<00:04:54.330> on<00:04:54.480> everything<00:04:54.930> but<00:04:55.500> anyways<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:56.430> was

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
that on everything but anyways I was

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.670 
that on everything but anyways I was
reading<00:04:57.300> in<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.600> comments<00:04:57.990> from<00:04:58.200> yesterday's

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
reading in the comments from yesterday's

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.680 
reading in the comments from yesterday's
video<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.580> guys<00:04:59.730> are<00:04:59.970> saying<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.660> is

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
video you guys are saying that this is

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.440 
video you guys are saying that this is
actually<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.350> rolls-royce<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.360> going

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
actually a rolls-royce so this is going

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.570 
actually a rolls-royce so this is going
to<00:05:03.570> be<00:05:03.630> modeled<00:05:03.930> after<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.500> as<00:05:05.160> far<00:05:05.370> as<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
to be modeled after that as far as the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.120 
to be modeled after that as far as the
exact<00:05:05.850> model<00:05:06.090> goes<00:05:06.450> there<00:05:06.900> was<00:05:07.140> some<00:05:07.560> some

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
exact model goes there was some some

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.950 
exact model goes there was some some
discussion<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:08.880> some<00:05:09.030> disagreement<00:05:09.630> but<00:05:09.810> go

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
discussion and some disagreement but go

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.150 
discussion and some disagreement but go
ahead<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.200> tell<00:05:10.350> me<00:05:10.530> in<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.710> comments<00:05:11.040> below

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
ahead and tell me in the comments below

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.370 
ahead and tell me in the comments below
if<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.550> do<00:05:11.700> know<00:05:11.880> which<00:05:12.150> which<00:05:12.720> rolls<00:05:13.020> really

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
if you do know which which rolls really

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.560 
if you do know which which rolls really
think<00:05:13.800> this<00:05:13.890> might<00:05:14.070> be<00:05:14.100> modeled<00:05:14.640> after<00:05:14.820> but

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
think this might be modeled after but

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.570 
think this might be modeled after but
