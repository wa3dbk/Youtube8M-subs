solid<00:00:19.680> kind<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.910> yeah<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:23.400> materials<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
solid kind so yeah the materials you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.439 
solid kind so yeah the materials you
will<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:25.010> air<00:00:26.010> dry<00:00:26.460> clay<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.090> using

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
will need are air dry clay and I'm using

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.960 
will need are air dry clay and I'm using
dices<00:00:28.080> edge<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.439> clay<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.550> probably

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
dices edge a clay but you can probably

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
dices edge a clay but you can probably
use<00:00:30.300> other<00:00:30.570> edge<00:00:30.810> edge<00:00:31.050> clays<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> really

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
use other edge edge clays but I really

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
use other edge edge clays but I really
preferred<00:00:32.340> ISOs<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.649> scribbles<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.950> reason

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
preferred ISOs and scribbles the reason

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
preferred ISOs and scribbles the reason
why<00:00:35.430> we're<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.149> using<00:00:36.450> scribbles<00:00:36.870> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
why we're going to be using scribbles is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.639 
why we're going to be using scribbles is
to<00:00:37.399> make<00:00:38.399> our<00:00:38.700> sprinkles<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.930> squishy<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
to make our sprinkles more squishy and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.430 
to make our sprinkles more squishy and
flexible<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.670> won't<00:00:41.820> break<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.239> easy<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
flexible and it won't break as easy so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.479 
flexible and it won't break as easy so
yeah<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> you'll<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.020> need<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:47.100> bit<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
yeah so you'll just need a little bit of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.209 
yeah so you'll just need a little bit of
clay<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.469> little

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
clay just a little bit because a little

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
clay just a little bit because a little
bit<00:00:50.370> goes<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> long<00:00:50.670> way<00:00:51.000> since<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.420> just

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
bit goes a long way since you're just

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
bit goes a long way since you're just
making<00:00:51.899> sprinkles<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> you'll<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> need<00:00:53.460> a

once you're done mixing all of the
scribbles<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.700> air<00:01:08.939> dry<00:01:09.119> clay<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
scribbles and I so air dry clay it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.370 
scribbles and I so air dry clay it
should<00:01:10.470> look<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.800 

so<00:01:16.380> yeah<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.549> can't<00:01:17.880> put<00:01:18.090> more<00:01:18.270> scribbles<00:01:18.689> if

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so yeah you can't put more scribbles if

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
so yeah you can't put more scribbles if
you<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> pink<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.740> more<00:01:19.979> darker<00:01:20.400> but

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you want the pink to be more darker but

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.820 
you want the pink to be more darker but

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
I chose to do more of a pastel pink so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
I chose to do more of a pastel pink so
yeah<00:01:25.830> we're<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> put

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
yeah we're just going to have to put

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.240 
yeah we're just going to have to put
this<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.530> ball<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:31.320> should<00:01:31.560> look<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.770> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
this in a ball it should look like this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.429 
this in a ball it should look like this
and<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> sprinkle<00:01:35.970> shape<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:37.200> first

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and to get the sprinkle shape the first

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.069 
and to get the sprinkle shape the first
step<00:01:37.650> you'll<00:01:37.890> need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.329> grab<00:01:39.630> like

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
step you'll need to do is just grab like

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:49.730 
step you'll need to do is just grab like
half<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:44.750> then<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.470> roll<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.500> into<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
half of it and then just roll it into a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.069 
half of it and then just roll it into a
really<00:01:50.250> thin<00:01:50.610> coil<00:01:51.030> since<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.810> want

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
really thin coil since you do not want

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.139 
really thin coil since you do not want
your<00:01:52.200> sprinkles<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.790> thick

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
your sprinkles to be really really thick

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.319 
your sprinkles to be really really thick
so<00:01:54.570> yeah<00:01:55.049> after<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:56.369> rolling<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.969> how

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so yeah after you're rolling this is how

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.899 
so yeah after you're rolling this is how
your<00:01:57.630> coils<00:01:58.049> should<00:01:58.140> look<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.729> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
your coils should look like and this is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.630 
your coils should look like and this is
just<00:02:00.119> around<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.380> perfect<00:02:01.770> size<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.100> too<00:02:02.610> big

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
just around the perfect size not too big

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
just around the perfect size not too big
and<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.149> too<00:02:03.210> small<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
and not too small and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.480 
and not too small and
little<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.850> close<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:09.679> yeah<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.039> then<00:02:11.400> you're

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
little up close so yeah and then you're

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.710 
little up close so yeah and then you're
just<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.820> wait<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> dry<00:02:12.600> it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
just going to wait for this to dry it
