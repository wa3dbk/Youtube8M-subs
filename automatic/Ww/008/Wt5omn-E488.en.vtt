00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:09.259
 hello very good sandro is going through 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.860
 our hands here at the fair of 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.599
 most important telephony of 2015 and in 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.219
 this case we are going to focus with the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.020
 evolution of disease that we will see 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.290
 at the time that we gave them a review 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.470
 complete good 16 in this case the 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.600
 variant a little bit bigger 16 light in 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.490
 finished turning with 5 inches and a 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.390
 very interesting detail like the double 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:41.899
 camera 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:44.269
 let's see many of you already 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.859
 you know the manufacturer huawei and also 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.839
 you know we have a new division 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.370
 a new player in the center of the 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.199
 smartphones and it's a variant of 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.879
 Chinese manufacturer as it is honor already 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.710
 us but what we have analyzed the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.989
 16 a terminal that we liked very much 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.329
 We are already in the mobile world congress and 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.460
 we have the opportunity to try the 16 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.769
 plus a slightly larger variant 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.630
 of honor 6 with pretty features 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.320
 similar and careful eye because they have a 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.060
 little detail 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.500
 in the aesthetic section quite curious 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.210
 and let's start here for the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.800
 design section we will provide the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.390
 maximum attention and if we were the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.860
 difference the honors range because 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.320
 we have a pretty design line 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.940
 pretty simple spartan a design 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.650
 pretty industrial as you see in the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.540
 front we have here arrange the finish 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.190
 in black finished in white and as you see 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.690
 Well, a little bit of noteworthy 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.150
 buttons on the screen we have in the part 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.070
 top the notification speaker the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.750
 camera and different sensors and we're going to 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.280
 see the sides to see the keypad and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.600
 to see a little bit also the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.250
 building materials as is 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.100
 we have a small finish that mimics the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.600
 pital and all the hardware is located in 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.009
 the same lateral we have on the one hand 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 the unlock button the control of 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.240
 volume and we have two slots to be able 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.399
 use them as dual sim and also for 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.600
 a slot for microsd cards as we see 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.880
 at the bottom we have a small 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.200
 curvature in the black finish that makes 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.780
 that improves a little from the section of 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.119
 harmony part microusb connection 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 The upper part is intended for 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.979
 the 3.5 jack and we have as you see a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.659
 connection for an infrared port 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.609
 something that from here to thank 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.979
 quite effect the personal thing seems to me 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.290
 quite useful the other side is left 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.060
 totally naked and we're going to go to the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.459
 rear part perhaps more 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.840
 interesting about this 16 plus and 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.640
 we found some details that we 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.900
 calls a lot of attention and from the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.000
 which we will talk a little more 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.150
 go forward with more depth camera 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.799
 Double rear camera double flash as you 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.959
 we say we'll see what use we can 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.819
 give this functionality and in the part 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:39.200
 lower we find the speaker 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:41.090
 we remind you this 16 761 in front of a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.769
 terminal very but very powerful that 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.260
 we made in 16 with a taste of mouth 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.970
 that we knew each other and here we 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.269
 we find with a processor even a 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.670
 little bit better concretely in 1925 is 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.129
 an obstacle that runs at 1.8 gigahertz 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.470
 three ideas of ramps and 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.340
 we have 32 gigs of storage in 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.230
 followed because we have a cost of 18 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.579
 so the storage section and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.709
 presumably in europe they are 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.359
 absolutely no problem 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.829
 let's talk about the battery and here we 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.760
 we bring another joy with this 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.280
 3600 milliamp device the truth 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.799
 that is very good an amount that we 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.299
 predicts a more than correct autonomy and 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.799
 it can even be a differential factor 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.389
 for people who want to buy 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.669
 this crop is true that it is very 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.410
 large screen of 5 25 inches but 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.239
 it seems that the autonomy part only 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.139
 we have too many problems like 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.139
 forever 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.780
 we have the four points that we have 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.250
 cooled 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 that we have the possibility of reaching 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.510
 big locks software moment 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.630
 as it is we have directly video what 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.310
 more important that we can be thanks to 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.700
 We still have the option to 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.270
 Chat 4.4 points signed by the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.769
 maker 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.180
 in this case it's hard not to forget about 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.880
 which is ahead of another store 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.410
 different for good and very good there is 3.0 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.910
 companies that already know a lot of 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.950
 you also had to have the 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 six the same and quite oriented 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.910
 we always say this type of manufacturers 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.229
 usually depend on a personalization 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.419
 quite extreme these devices 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.070
 we must say that both one and cobos 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.260
 still suffered the facelift quite 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.030
 important in what interface is concerned 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.040
 every time they are applications a little bit more 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.330
 beautiful always Mr. clock taught the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.040
 calendar because I think it seems to me 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.930
 interesting that you are yourselves 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.580
 who sees is a little the aesthetics that have 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.620
 taken applications of time today we're going 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.050
 to see how little by little they are a little 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.879
 more more attractive as we see 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.770
 with a little more care in some 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.509
 details that we know that especially for 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.849
 the most western public we appreciate 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.409
 simpler more minimalist and not with 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.509
 aesthetics are loaded all that 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.340
 we had seen on other occasions according to 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.199
 interesting that has this one without 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.090
 plus is a large format screen and 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.620
 we have the possibility even of being able 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.389
 hide the mice from the way 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.530
 emiliano vista who we went up to 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.449
 up and again we have them 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.789
 very much available the barriers of 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.889
 holidays divide notifications and 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.409
 small shortcuts as you see from 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.759
 a comfortable way we will be able to choose and 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.009
 we will be able to calibrate different 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.139
 words in a simple way and we will access 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.210
 to the adjustments so that since we 're 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.460
 here we take a look and as you see 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.440
 also divided into all has a 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.849
 section of general to make us the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.409
 life a little easier since 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.580
 we are here we go a little bit 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.560
 storage I think it's interesting 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.120
 do it whenever this is the version 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.919
 of 32 gigs is the only one that we have 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.529
 available and as you can see we are going to have 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.269
 practically in 26 gigas 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.949
 we went on to talk about the screen of this 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:41.869
 honor 6 plus and one of the main 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.909
 features I wanted this device 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:46.009
 compared to the previous version is that it is 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:49.279
 a larger device specifically 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:52.219
 5 with 5 inch ps technology and 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:53.719
 resolution full hd nothing of 2k a 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.509
 technology that no longer sounds very much and 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.969
 It reminds me a lot of the truth to the previous 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.679
 version for 16 would not be a technology 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.989
 that has enhanced it but to simple 

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:04.669
 view seems really similar well and 

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:06.589
 works very well especially the 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.239
 ips panels as you know they are very 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.979
 to my liking and we have good angles of 

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:11.509
 vision we have pretty pure blacks 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.579
 for the provision of colors 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.989
 pretty good and good we have the 

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:16.579
 opportunity to have some images 

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:17.869
 shows how you are seeing and the 

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.819
 true that the screen looks pretty 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:21.229
 well the audio section we have not said 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.929
 in the section is critical we have it 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.339
 located in the back we are going to give 

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:26.779
 a little bit of the cameras section 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.279
 of the following multimedia section of 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:30.469
 this or two exp we're going to start 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.100
 by the front camera 8 megapixels of 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.140
 resolution 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.000
 and as you see it looks really well is 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.070
 an authentic wonder to be able to count on 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.810
 front cameras of this quality there 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.700
 some more traditional manufacturers 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.290
 who bet on the 5 million but we 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.870
 like many many Asians 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.920
 Chinese criminals have 8 and 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.710
 truth that is enough let's do 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.940
 some catch for you to see and this 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.950
 sign differentiation as you have seen 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.930
 this little rectangle that we see in the 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.440
 top to see us and see 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.870
 How are you 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.910
 we go out we're going to move to the back that 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.140
 is undoubtedly the most interesting before I 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.630
 you have seen in the aesthetic section that 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.550
 we have a double rear camera in this 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.700
 case are two 8 megapixel cameras 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.290
 with double flash which will be able 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.450
 serve to get especially two 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.400
 aspects on the one hand greater focus and 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.200
 Higher quality in low light situations 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.240
 it's something we appreciate is a 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.920
 innovation is returning to the field of 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.900
 the cameras that many times 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.670
 manufacturers the dog not only in
