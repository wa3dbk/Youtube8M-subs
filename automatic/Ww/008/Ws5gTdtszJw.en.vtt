00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.219

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.360

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.420
 misunderstanding 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.560

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.260

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.130

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:01.040

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:03.620

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.720

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.870
 working 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.560

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:26.020

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.100
 holiday and spoke taste so poor and so 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.350
 at my head 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.090
 eyes closed and beaks 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:41.460
