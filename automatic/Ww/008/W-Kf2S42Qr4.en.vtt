00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
here okay we have cyber Pegasus and I

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.550 
here okay we have cyber Pegasus and I
actually<00:04:54.150> needed<00:04:54.540> another<00:04:54.840> cyber<00:04:55.080> Pegasus

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
actually needed another cyber Pegasus

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.520 
actually needed another cyber Pegasus
because<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:55.890> took<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.250> cyber<00:04:56.460> wheel<00:04:56.730> off<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.530> my

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
because I took the cyber wheel off of my

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.410 
because I took the cyber wheel off of my
original<00:04:58.680> cyber<00:04:59.100> Pegasus<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.760> I<00:04:59.880> unboxed

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
original cyber Pegasus that I unboxed

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.060 
original cyber Pegasus that I unboxed
and<00:05:00.600> I<00:05:00.660> put<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.960> on<00:05:01.140> one<00:05:01.380> my<00:05:01.500> custom<00:05:01.830> attack

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
and I put it on one my custom attack

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.340 
and I put it on one my custom attack
types<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.730> this<00:05:03.060> wheel<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.540> really<00:05:03.780> well<00:05:04.080> it

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
types and this wheel is really well it

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.170 
types and this wheel is really well it
does<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.920> lot<00:05:05.100> of<00:05:05.160> really<00:05:05.430> good<00:05:05.550> smash<00:05:05.850> attacks

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
does a lot of really good smash attacks

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.820
