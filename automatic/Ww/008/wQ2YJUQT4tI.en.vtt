00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
once you have them in place two things

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.279 
once you have them in place two things
that<00:01:19.060> are<00:01:19.090> fantastic<00:01:19.749> number<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.109> is<00:01:20.259> that

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
that are fantastic number one is that

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.380 
that are fantastic number one is that
the<00:01:21.009> boards<00:01:21.310> have<00:01:21.429> a<00:01:21.490> grid<00:01:21.729> pattern<00:01:21.939> on<00:01:22.149> them

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
the boards have a grid pattern on them

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.270 
the boards have a grid pattern on them
makes<00:01:23.049> it<00:01:23.170> easier<00:01:23.469> to<00:01:23.499> tile<00:01:23.859> you<00:01:24.069> don't<00:01:24.189> have

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
existing wall board with the membrane

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.429 
existing wall board with the membrane
itself<00:01:57.179> you<00:01:58.179> mortar<00:01:58.539> it<00:01:58.689> on<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.200> you've

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
itself you mortar it on and you've

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.709 
itself you mortar it on and you've
created<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.979> same<00:02:00.189> waterproof<00:02:00.759> membrane<00:02:00.999> if

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
created the same waterproof membrane if

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.419 
created the same waterproof membrane if
you're<00:02:01.959> starting<00:02:02.319> from<00:02:02.469> scratch<00:02:02.709> as<00:02:03.039> we<00:02:03.249> are

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
you're starting from scratch as we are

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.699 
you're starting from scratch as we are
this<00:02:04.029> is<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.420> preferred<00:02:04.749> method<00:02:04.779> it's<00:02:05.350> easier

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
this is the preferred method it's easier

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.800 
this is the preferred method it's easier
it's<00:02:05.920> faster<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:06.520> combines<00:02:06.880> two<00:02:07.149> steps<00:02:07.420> into

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
it's faster it combines two steps into

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.839 
it's faster it combines two steps into
one<00:02:08.759> exactly<00:02:09.759> what<00:02:09.880> we're<00:02:10.000> doing

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
one exactly what we're doing

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.759 
one exactly what we're doing
the<00:02:11.849> kerdi-board<00:02:12.269> itself<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.049> waterproof

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
the kerdi-board itself is waterproof

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.520 
the kerdi-board itself is waterproof
it's<00:02:14.400> fantastic<00:02:15.269> but<00:02:15.629> what<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it's fantastic but what I like is the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.709 
it's fantastic but what I like is the
whole<00:02:16.769> Schluter<00:02:17.280> system<00:02:17.879> which<00:02:18.329> comes<00:02:18.599> with

completely sealed system everything from
the<00:02:25.950> spout<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:28.799> we<00:02:28.980> will<00:02:29.189> order<00:02:29.819> this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the spout and then we will order this

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.990 
the spout and then we will order this
right<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.870> wall<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.310> shower<00:02:32.609> valve

I<00:03:12.250> finished<00:03:13.250> off<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.610> bathroom<00:03:14.150> with<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> very

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
I finished off this bathroom with a very

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.800 
I finished off this bathroom with a very
low-profile<00:03:15.560> tub<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.490> classic<00:03:16.940> brick
