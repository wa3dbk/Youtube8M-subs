00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.690
 reasonable 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.700
 but every other minute the partie 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.870

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.060
 a higher leadership of the huskies too 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.220
 beginning of the last third were the

 gate 52 30 or water 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.030

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.739
 For this reason the kassel huskies hope 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.300
