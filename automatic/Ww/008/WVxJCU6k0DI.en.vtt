00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 and people that the good this time I'll show 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.760
 another attack of not wanting to buy a 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.440
 serious only from attack or want to think 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.199
 very cool was another revenge 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 who stands in the total old grandstand 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.439
 Of the cases, the guy attacks me thinking he's going 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.210
 get well and it was good the other way around 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.599
 diversify here is this one this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.260
 So bad sir and look who used a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.440
 fury if a figure in dark cotton 35 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.690
 gov 15 gantz 12 the wall and I think it is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 an indicator that much because only by 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.309
 Robot almost nothing in three ways maybe 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:52.550
 He already arranged, kidding, it's broken. 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:56.270
 in this scope do car die of attack 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:03.289
 With his life, it counts who with good 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.289
 whether they have porters minus 6 and 5 356 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 8898 level 9 level love tower magician 5 4 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.909
 088 this is it is a series of eight right né 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.080
 the beginning of 2008 already has a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.360
 68 right? 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.930
 It gives to realize obviously and quite 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.020
 wall is not even 8 and is not strawberry enough 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.579
 good black numbers then showing the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.630
 attacked let's go to the replay 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:45.509
 what was the composition of these was three 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.340
 curves 22 valkyrie valkyrie baby three 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.430
 Breaks changes just try to win a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.170
 Bit of a guess I think half 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.689
 no an archer out I think 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.399
 five portfolios at most was 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.210
 clan 30 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.110
 we will see here served 10 6% succeeded 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.110
 steal cool 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.410
 fashion as Ivan also that enjoys a 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.970
 error 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.060
 starting here I'll start with the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.460
 left almost in the exchange hut 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.540
 club is that it has something so I 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.910
 I started to give a beard a passionate 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.800
 So I said, then you're allowing the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.160
 attack 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.110
 so I thought I'll try to rob a 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.720
 So the rocker's bushel is very 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.920
 easy with that part around 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.560
 so think there decided this part here 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.959
 accent was here to try to avoid 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.550
 part of the dew mortars right right né 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.920
 do you know that inner 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.920
 I think I only have three archers only have 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.640
 two daughters here to try clean in this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.709
 page 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.670
 right after 3 yesterday that I was a musician 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:03.320
 which is fashionable level 8 and conception tavares the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.500
 only there he quickly concluded them 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.860
 were labeled but it did not go wrong there. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.720
 I saw what 's going on here when 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.110
 I let put the case for the three 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.110
 each 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.450
 they got in they get they destroyed 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.549
 and will start getting here for the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.180
 mortars are only has a curve here that 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.719
 are taking the damage classes and here already 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.840
 you were around here you see what you see 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:41.250
 which were more in the fall to below 6 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.010
 and another up here then as here in 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.519
 Up already the father of everything does not have to focus 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.169
 100% on strong defenses 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.500
 I 'll cite two turns in one of the 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:54.500
 arms that are here as soon as I was 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.500
 only those who played a role 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.109
 really good right 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.209

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.449

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:24.300

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:30.860
 to say that there was a lot of walcheria left 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:40.949
 much because the beyblade wheel will pawn 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:46.470

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.280
 a war and if it would take 3 for 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.680

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.060
