sure<00:01:05.530> how<00:01:05.680> legit<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:07.180> report<00:01:07.540> also

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
sure how legit it is this report also

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.240 
sure how legit it is this report also
said<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.170> iPad<00:01:08.470> pro<00:01:08.500> would<00:01:08.890> be<00:01:08.979> somewhere

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
said the iPad pro would be somewhere

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.219 
said the iPad pro would be somewhere
between<00:01:09.400> six<00:01:09.759> point<00:01:10.000> nine<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.360> seven<00:01:10.990> point

between six point nine and seven point
one<00:01:11.259> millimeters<00:01:11.860> though<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.549> think<00:01:12.610> this

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
one millimeters though so I think this

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.630 
one millimeters though so I think this
is<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.210> pretty<00:01:13.570> realistic<00:01:13.960> range<00:01:14.439> now<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.460> iPad

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
is a pretty realistic range now the iPad

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.219 
is a pretty realistic range now the iPad
plus<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.180> larger<00:01:16.509> screen<00:01:16.780> will<00:01:16.930> supposedly

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
plus is larger screen will supposedly

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.740 
plus is larger screen will supposedly
support<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.770> 2k<00:01:18.220> resolution<00:01:18.369> but<00:01:19.270> as<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.479> iPad

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750
