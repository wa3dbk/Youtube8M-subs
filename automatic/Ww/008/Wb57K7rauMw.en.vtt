order from how it would be used so that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.020 
order from how it would be used so that
would<00:01:49.860> start<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.400> obviously<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
would start with like obviously when you

would start with like obviously when you
drink<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.930> taste<00:01:52.940> actually<00:01:53.940> have

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
drink it there's a taste actually have

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600 
drink it there's a taste actually have
some<00:01:54.240> right<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.890> from<00:01:55.890> taste<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.400> then<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
some right here from taste and then it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.970 
some right here from taste and then it
would<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.730> like<00:01:57.000> activation<00:01:57.600> time<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.050> then

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
would be like activation time and then

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.500 
would be like activation time and then
your<00:01:59.220> actual<00:01:59.520> training<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.180> energy

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
your actual training so like energy

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.860 
your actual training so like energy
focus<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.410> pump<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.000> length<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.480> that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
focus the pump and the length of that

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.540 
focus the pump and the length of that
the<00:02:04.110> length<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.800> effect<00:02:05.160> lasts

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
the length of that the effect lasts

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.610 
the length of that the effect lasts
after<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.870> got<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.080> come<00:02:07.260> down<00:02:07.290> because

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
after that you got to come down because

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.010 
after that you got to come down because
nobody<00:02:08.010> likes<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> feel<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.520> shit<00:02:08.670> after<00:02:09.020> and

nobody likes to feel like shit after and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.050 
nobody likes to feel like shit after and
then<00:02:10.140> my<00:02:10.230> overall<00:02:10.470> rating<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.430> starting<00:02:12.000> with

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
then my overall rating so starting with

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.770 
then my overall rating so starting with
taste<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> may<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.240> thing<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.450> keeps

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
taste this may be the thing that keeps

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.230 
taste this may be the thing that keeps
it<00:02:15.960> from<00:02:15.990> having<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.710> perfect<00:02:17.040> score<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.000> taste

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
it from having a perfect score the taste

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.880 
it from having a perfect score the taste
is<00:02:18.480> not<00:02:18.600> really<00:02:18.840> good<00:02:18.990> plus<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.860> one

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890

of those pre workouts I don't know if it
happens<00:02:21.210> every<00:02:21.360> time<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.320> first<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
happens every time but the first the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.700 
happens every time but the first the
first<00:02:25.070> opening<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.050> jar<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.590> was

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
first opening of the the jar it was

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.350 
first opening of the the jar it was
pretty<00:02:28.860> clumpy<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.250> nasty<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> almost

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
pretty clumpy and nasty so I almost

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.520 
pretty clumpy and nasty so I almost
brought<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.260> fuck<00:02:31.410> it

I'll<00:02:31.800> deal<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.080> activation<00:02:34.080> time<00:02:34.410> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
I'll deal with it and activation time I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.770 
I'll deal with it and activation time I
would<00:02:35.100> say<00:02:35.250> about<00:02:35.400> fifteen<00:02:35.820> fifteen<00:02:36.540> thirty

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
would say about fifteen fifteen thirty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.840 
would say about fifteen fifteen thirty
minutes<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.860> when<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.220> start<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.640> feel

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850
