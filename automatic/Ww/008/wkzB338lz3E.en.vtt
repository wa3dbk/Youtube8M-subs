00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.740
 central station where almost the cost of travelers who are rather rare a

 situation that is starting to seriously annoy the elected officials of the surrounding communities 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.799
 we ask 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.359
 better articulation between 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.970
 station of the part-god of the pensioners who perishes 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.199
 but also new destinations 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.710
 to Sweden 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.240
 in other words, four additional daily round trips in the direction of

 it's more than health guards are good souls for example 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.300
 but that remains insufficiently elected 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.120
 we are an important pool of life 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.350
 five thousand people who today decide to go to the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 mainly on the same idea 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.860

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 the crossing lasts and go there to the station of the part-god 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.010

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.090
 for companies 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.320
 the need of them 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 our economic development 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.540
 the development of the population that was only between the latter 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.340

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.710
 it will actually be accompanied 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.970
 the facilities 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.720
 starting to fix 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.370
