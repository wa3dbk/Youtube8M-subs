okay so now now you see we have um these
lines<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:19.000> here<00:01:19.329> and<00:01:19.539> turn<00:01:20.500> into<00:01:20.680> the

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
lines right here and turn into the

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.679 
lines right here and turn into the
diamond<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:22.350> pull<00:01:23.549> pull<00:01:24.549> these<00:01:24.820> two<00:01:25.149> corners

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
diamond and pull pull these two corners

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:35.249 
diamond and pull pull these two corners
to<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.229> bottom<00:01:26.679> like<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
to the bottom like this this is the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:45.059 
to the bottom like this this is the
difficult<00:01:35.950> part<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:44.259> we're<00:01:44.619> going<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.920> make<00:01:45.039> a

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
difficult part now we're going to make a

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.690 
difficult part now we're going to make a
couple<00:01:46.060> fold<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:47.200> fold<00:01:47.709> this<00:01:47.950> corner<00:01:48.220> entry

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
couple fold so fold this corner entry

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:00.959 
couple fold so fold this corner entry
Center<00:01:53.580> same<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.880> other<00:01:54.909> side

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:16.699 

turn<00:02:01.969> it<00:02:02.179> over<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.289> same<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.950> other<00:02:03.979> side

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.280 

then<00:02:17.159> take<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.269> corner<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.019> fold<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.560> down

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
then take this corner and fold it down

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.979 
then take this corner and fold it down
so<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.319> will<00:02:22.680> they'll<00:02:23.040> learn<00:02:23.400> with<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:26.989> then

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
so I will they'll learn with that then

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.240 
so I will they'll learn with that then
you<00:02:28.109> didn't<00:02:28.319> say<00:02:28.560> one<00:02:28.829> back

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.670 

now<00:02:35.250> unfold<00:02:35.879> Li's<00:02:36.359> we're<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.049> take<00:02:37.409> this

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
now unfold Li's we're going to take this

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.629 
now unfold Li's we're going to take this
corner<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.310> fold<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.209> up<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.219> it<00:02:41.400> will

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
corner and fold it up and so so it will

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.809 
corner and fold it up and so so it will
align<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:43.109> lying<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.799> here<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
align with just lying right here now it

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.220 
align with just lying right here now it
forms<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.359> boat<00:02:48.599> if<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.109> want<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:51.230> if

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
forms the boat if you want to you and if

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.149 
forms the boat if you want to you and if
you<00:02:52.409> want<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:53.129> can<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:54.919> you<00:02:55.919> could<00:02:56.099> just

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
you want to you can just you could just

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.050 
you want to you can just you could just
put<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.970> person<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> lego<00:02:58.889> person<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.700> put

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
put a person like a lego person and put

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.209 
put a person like a lego person and put
it<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.329> there<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:00.840> we're<00:03:01.109> making<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> origami

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
it in there but we're making the origami

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.770 
it in there but we're making the origami
bowls<00:03:02.639> full<00:03:02.939> so<00:03:03.599> just<00:03:04.230> for<00:03:04.620> boats<00:03:05.659> pull<00:03:06.659> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
bowls full so just for boats pull the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
bowls full so just for boats pull the
boat<00:03:06.989> out<00:03:07.169> then<00:03:07.769> flatten<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:09.030> dough

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.130 

turn<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.810> over<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.790> blame<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.960> other

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
turn it over just blame on the other

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.510 
turn it over just blame on the other
side<00:03:22.550> forms<00:03:23.550> above<00:03:23.820> again<00:03:24.590> go<00:03:25.590> above<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.400> out

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
side forms above again go above it out

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:36.890 
side forms above again go above it out
then<00:03:26.940> bottom<00:03:27.660> row<00:03:34.190> now<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> see<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.330> have<00:03:36.480> two

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
then bottom row now you see we have two

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.250 
then bottom row now you see we have two
things<00:03:37.320> right<00:03:37.830> here<00:03:38.510> these<00:03:39.510> are<00:03:39.750> going<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.110> be

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
things right here these are going to be

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.400 
things right here these are going to be
its<00:03:40.410> bottoms

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
its bottoms

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.720
