00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.340 
so i'm gonna be melee range most the
time<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.150> easier<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.660> get<00:02:58.780> off<00:02:58.930> opposed

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
time so it's easier to get off opposed

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.259 
time so it's easier to get off opposed
to<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.590> i<00:02:59.650> was<00:02:59.800> playing<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.310> range<00:03:00.880> character

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
to if i was playing a range character

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.670 
to if i was playing a range character
with<00:03:01.360> smite<00:03:01.570> since<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> very<00:03:02.140> short<00:03:02.440> range

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
with smite since it's a very short range

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.780 
with smite since it's a very short range
so<00:03:02.890> i<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.070> better<00:03:03.220> chance<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.640> actually

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
so i have a better chance of actually

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.060 
so i have a better chance of actually
