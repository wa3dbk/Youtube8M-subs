00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
long as you're revving it but that's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.860 
long as you're revving it but that's
only<00:00:34.310> nomads<00:00:34.790> half<00:00:35.030> hour<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.480> rest<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.810> the

only nomads half hour the rest of the
time<00:00:36.110> you're<00:00:36.410> not<00:00:36.650> always<00:00:37.130> in<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.520> mood<00:00:37.670> and

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
time you're not always in the mood and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.110 
time you're not always in the mood and
this<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.840> where<00:00:39.080> the<00:00:39.620> golf<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.070> great<00:00:40.400> it's<00:00:40.820> a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
this is where the golf is great it's a

this is where the golf is great it's a
turbocharged<00:00:41.840> two-liter<00:00:42.440> engine<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.610> you

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
turbocharged two-liter engine so you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.729 
turbocharged two-liter engine so you
don't<00:00:44.030> have<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.540> be<00:00:44.660> revving<00:00:45.020> it<00:00:45.200> all<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.710> time

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
because if you do it still got loads of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.950 
because if you do it still got loads of
power<00:00:48.200> but<00:00:48.500> even<00:00:48.980> in<00:00:49.100> third<00:00:49.370> gear<00:00:49.660> fourth<00:00:50.660> gear

at<00:00:51.260> low<00:00:51.620> revs<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.760> got<00:00:52.940> plenty<00:00:53.090> of<00:00:53.330> foam<00:00:54.430> but

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
at low revs it's got plenty of foam but

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.340 
at low revs it's got plenty of foam but
the<00:00:55.520> thing<00:00:55.700> that's<00:00:55.820> impressed<00:00:56.330> me<00:00:56.480> most<00:00:56.780> is
