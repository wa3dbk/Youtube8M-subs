00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.180
 towards gala 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
 next to the house of dulcinea we 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.770
 We found the ferris wheel behind 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.040

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.860

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.860

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.080
 very good don juan that such my grandmother 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.240
 rich food the truth is that yes guesses 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.900
 riddle that for this table that I 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.860
 grapes meeting ether crumbs can 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.860
 be that you are going to make a friend 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.190
 come on let's go we 're starting with the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.870
 star dish in the inn the ferris wheel was 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.730
 a pastor who taught John the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.730
 secrets of these crumbs all signs 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.920
 one that you go out to put a beer 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 when you come stowed 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.240
 So they already know a lot of love and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.750
 attention already gave me fire so that it does not 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750
 burn us 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.880
 I would like to john that our 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.700
 kitchens of our people in La Mancha 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.220
 to go giving advice the advice that we 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.159
 Don Juan at the inn the Ferris wheel that 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.800
 crumbs do not get caught what you want 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.020
 say juan 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.500
 means that if the crumbs are made 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.590
 with a lot of gas very fast because they burn 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 on the outside very fast and inside is not 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.490
 they have done in conditions 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.430
 let's put our brains right now 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.830
 we put processes as we said well 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.500
 known 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.760
 and pork bacon advisory chorizo ​​and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.760
 eggs 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 ah 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.740
 the result one of the favorite dishes 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.030
 of sancho the duels and losses that 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.160
 I say how important is the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 content as the continent or wherever 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.210
 one on the dishes also housed 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.310
 man because it also influences 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.590
 there are indeed dishes that serve them 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.750
 in dishes and large sets but I 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.240
 I think some crumbs and duels 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.100
 you have to serve them in a frying pan 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.870
 like all of life and where we serve it 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.240
 well in this room that you are seeing 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.850
 you are very own for this kitchen 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.610
 traditional with its tablecloth of squares 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 I put here the grapes the duels and 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.620
 quebrantos and crumbs and Juan just me 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.060
 it is to try I will try but neither 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.290
 a lot because we still have a lot 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.830
 kitchen ahead that is us 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.830
 waiting standing 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.450
 at the crossroads between pedro muñoz 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.160
 and field of criptana we find ourselves with 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.220
 the corner of the house spot founded in 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.510
 the year 1973 by petra and by vicente 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.630
 we are going to look for the meadow that is in the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.630
 kitchen 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.270
 are looking at meadow hands and it's 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.250
 that if there is something that characterizes 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.660
 cuisine is originality in the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.270
 presentation of the good dishes for 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.850
 two or what is it is some broken eggs or 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.230
 be a little bit I love the format and 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.150
 more little things that I'm seeing around here 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.150
 because for example this dish is 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.060
 original of itself is a raid put 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.030
 in an empty Don Quixote with the yolk 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.280
 that is raw and with a clear that is 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.200
 fried under pesto art and 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 creativity in the kitchen and art too 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.890
 on the walls of this gastronomic house 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.950
 where they exhibit their works painters of the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.880
 region 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.520
 and you are bet 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.520
 we ask for active engineers
