00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.030 

architecture<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:22.180> it's<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.360> result<00:00:23.780> of<00:00:24.290> going

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
architecture is it's the result of going

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.580 
architecture is it's the result of going
beyond<00:00:25.870> shelter<00:00:26.950> providing<00:00:29.110> problem<00:00:30.110> solving

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
beyond shelter providing problem solving

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.920 
beyond shelter providing problem solving
but<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:30.980> goes<00:00:31.160> beyond<00:00:31.610> that<00:00:31.810> architecture<00:00:32.810> to

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
but it goes beyond that architecture to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.700 
but it goes beyond that architecture to
me<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.070> way<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.280> responding<00:00:35.170> to<00:00:36.170> people's

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
me is the way of responding to people's

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.740 
me is the way of responding to people's
ideals<00:00:37.640> their<00:00:38.000> values<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:39.580> it's<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:41.000> it's

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
ideals their values and it's and it's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.640 
ideals their values and it's and it's
the<00:00:42.410> record<00:00:42.830> it<00:00:43.070> is<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.430> record<00:00:43.700> of<00:00:44.530> what<00:00:45.530> we

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
the record it is the record of what we

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.850 
the record it is the record of what we
care<00:00:45.890> about<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:47.239> record<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.809> our<00:00:47.900> culture<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
care about the record of our culture the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.729 
care about the record of our culture the
record<00:00:49.309> about<00:00:49.670> values<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.470> it<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.590> the

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
record about values and it is the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.740 
record about values and it is the
tangible<00:00:52.370> part<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.630> stays<00:00:54.230> even<00:00:55.070> though<00:00:55.750> we

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
tangible part that stays even though we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.280 
tangible part that stays even though we
might<00:00:56.900> be<00:00:57.200> gone<00:00:58.000> yeah<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.210> is

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
might be gone yeah it is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.830 
might be gone yeah it is
it's<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.800> permanence<00:01:01.310> it's<00:01:01.670> a

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.190 

I<00:01:06.640> think<00:01:07.640> our<00:01:07.759> role<00:01:07.969> and<00:01:08.240> our<00:01:08.390> responsibility

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
I think our role and our responsibility

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.219 
I think our role and our responsibility
is<00:01:09.439> to<00:01:09.500> people<00:01:10.070> basically<00:01:11.060> architecture<00:01:12.049> is

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
is to people basically architecture is

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.649 
is to people basically architecture is
for<00:01:12.500> people<00:01:12.679> and<00:01:13.609> if<00:01:13.820> we<00:01:13.939> don't<00:01:14.060> do<00:01:14.329> that<00:01:14.359> in

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
for people and if we don't do that in

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.609 
for people and if we don't do that in
with<00:01:14.929> people<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:15.710> mind<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.899> it's<00:01:17.899> an<00:01:18.289> empty

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
with people in mind and it's an empty

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.120 
with people in mind and it's an empty
shell

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
shell

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.819 
shell
because<00:01:20.000> architecture<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.929> how<00:01:21.259> we<00:01:21.319> relate<00:01:21.770> to

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
because architecture is how we relate to

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.910 
because architecture is how we relate to
each<00:01:21.979> other<00:01:22.369> within<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.090> architecture<00:01:23.920> we

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
each other within the architecture we

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.529 
each other within the architecture we
relate<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.670> each<00:01:25.759> other<00:01:26.020> we<00:01:28.329> work<00:01:29.329> together

loss of life our responsibility is is

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.449 
loss of life our responsibility is is
also<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:53.619> build<00:01:54.619> hope<00:01:56.890> architecture<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.099> can

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
also to build hope architecture can can

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.780 
also to build hope architecture can can
have<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.819> power

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.700 

the<00:02:04.790> yeah<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.020> has<00:02:06.140> been<00:02:06.260> talked<00:02:06.470> about<00:02:06.560> a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the yeah this has been talked about a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.529 
the yeah this has been talked about a
lot<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.160> challenges<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:07.790> women<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
lot the challenges for women and and

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.719 
lot the challenges for women and and
it's<00:02:08.660> not<00:02:08.840> only<00:02:09.050> something<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.580> in

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
it's not only something that that is in

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.360 
it's not only something that that is in
our<00:02:10.880> industry<00:02:11.480> that's<00:02:12.320> in<00:02:12.590> other<00:02:12.830> district

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
our industry that's in other district

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.700 
our industry that's in other district
industries<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.330> other<00:02:14.480> professions<00:02:15.080> they're

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
industries and other professions they're

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.190 
industries and other professions they're
facing<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.220> same<00:02:16.400> problem<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.420> how<00:02:17.810> do<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
facing the same problem of how do you

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.070 
facing the same problem of how do you
attract<00:02:18.590> women<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.160> how<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:20.080> retain

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
attract women and how do you retain

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.950 
attract women and how do you retain
women<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.190> profession<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.570> think<00:02:23.810> one

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
women in the profession and I think one

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.840 
women in the profession and I think one
of<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.170> things<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.530> we<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.040> realize<00:02:25.400> is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
of the things that we have to realize is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.400 
of the things that we have to realize is
that<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:26.600> are<00:02:26.660> many<00:02:26.810> choices<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.350> life<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that there are many choices in life and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.910 
that there are many choices in life and
Parenthood<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.340> them<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:32.920> sometimes

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
Parenthood is one of them and sometimes

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.050 
Parenthood is one of them and sometimes
you<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.760> take<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.990> time<00:02:36.260> away<00:02:36.700> from<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you have to take the time away from the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.520 
you have to take the time away from the
career<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.959> develop<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.600> nurture<00:02:41.600> your

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
career to develop and nurture your

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.560 
career to develop and nurture your
children<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.160> that's<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.700> good<00:02:43.820> thing<00:02:43.880> because

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
children and that's a good thing because

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.300 
children and that's a good thing because
while<00:02:44.959> you're<00:02:45.170> doing<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.980> are<00:02:46.100> building

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
while you're doing that you are building

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.030 
while you're doing that you are building
on<00:02:46.640> life's<00:02:46.940> experience<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.739> when<00:02:48.920> you

on life's experience and that when you
come<00:02:49.220> back<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.970> career<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.989> really<00:02:51.260> add

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
come back to the career you really add

I<00:05:40.270> think<00:05:41.270> that<00:05:41.479> the<00:05:41.599> 21st<00:05:42.050> century<00:05:42.409> practice

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
I think that the 21st century practice

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.850 
I think that the 21st century practice
for<00:05:43.220> architect<00:05:43.639> is<00:05:43.699> a<00:05:43.729> global<00:05:44.210> practice<00:05:44.860> you

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
for architect is a global practice you

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.559 
for architect is a global practice you
have<00:05:46.069> to<00:05:46.250> think<00:05:46.460> globally<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.120> that<00:05:47.330> means

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
have to think globally and that means

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.820 
have to think globally and that means
that<00:05:47.810> we<00:05:47.990> have<00:05:48.020> to<00:05:49.689> really<00:05:50.689> be<00:05:50.830> appreciative

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
that we have to really be appreciative

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.540 
that we have to really be appreciative
of<00:05:52.039> all<00:05:52.250> cultures<00:05:52.990> because<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.860> opportunity
