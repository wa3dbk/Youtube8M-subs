I'm sure most of you know what the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.389 
I'm sure most of you know what the
trophy<00:00:31.140> system<00:00:31.439> does<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> destroys<00:00:32.040> oncoming

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
trophy system does it destroys oncoming

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
trophy system does it destroys oncoming
enemy<00:00:32.669> projectiles<00:00:32.840> however<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.960> only

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
enemy projectiles however can only

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.180 
enemy projectiles however can only
destroy<00:00:34.320> two<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> them<00:00:34.739> before<00:00:35.040> being

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
destroy two of them before being

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.709 
destroy two of them before being
destroyed<00:00:35.520> itself<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.390> i'm<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
destroyed itself so i'm going to be

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.150 
destroyed itself so i'm going to be
showing<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> little<00:00:37.290> strategy<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> i

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
showing you a little strategy and i

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.380 
showing you a little strategy and i
would<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.790> far<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.059> saying<00:00:39.239> it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
would actually go as far as saying it's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.580 
would actually go as far as saying it's
a<00:00:39.450> glitch<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:39.899> i<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.379> truck

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
a glitch because i don't think truck

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
a glitch because i don't think truck
meant<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> guys

doing one simple step so to get into the
glitch<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> throw<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:48.840> trophy<00:00:49.140> system

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
glitch when you throw your trophy system

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
glitch when you throw your trophy system
down<00:00:49.620> an<00:00:49.829> enemy<00:00:49.950> projectile<00:00:50.579> comes<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:50.969> way

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and gets destroyed by the trophy system

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.889 
and gets destroyed by the trophy system
shot<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.120> pick<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.600> trophy

shot you can then pick up your trophy
system<00:00:55.230> throw<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.039> again<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
system throw it out there again and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.220 
system throw it out there again and
you'll<00:00:57.059> notice<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> does<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.899> destroyed

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you'll notice it does not get destroyed

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110 
you'll notice it does not get destroyed
after<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> second<00:00:58.980> projectile<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.000> can

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
after the second projectile and you can

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
after the second projectile and you can
do<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.329> forever<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:01.020> an<00:01:01.140> unlimited<00:01:01.469> amount

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
do this forever like an unlimited amount

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
do this forever like an unlimited amount
of<00:01:01.859> times<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.340> never<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.820> destroyed<00:01:03.149> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of times it will never get destroyed so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.119 
of times it will never get destroyed so
obviously<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> actually<00:01:04.979> gonna<00:01:05.070> be

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
obviously this is actually gonna be

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
obviously this is actually gonna be
pretty<00:01:05.309> useful<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.790> capital<00:01:06.180> flag<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.720> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
pretty useful in capital flag or on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.660 
pretty useful in capital flag or on
headquarters<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> something<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.040> but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
headquarters to something like that but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.710 
headquarters to something like that but
what<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> found<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.270> another<00:01:09.450> pretty

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
what I found to be another pretty

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.120 
what I found to be another pretty
awesome<00:01:10.020> used<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.860> survive

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
awesome used for this is to survive

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070 
awesome used for this is to survive
hunter<00:01:11.580> killer<00:01:11.820> drones<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:12.930> know

hunter killer drones if you don't know

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.719 
hunter killer drones if you don't know
trophy<00:01:13.500> systems<00:01:13.770> destroy<00:01:14.130> these<00:01:14.340> things<00:01:14.580> as

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
trophy systems destroy these things as

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
trophy systems destroy these things as
well<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.360> whenever<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.689> hear<00:01:15.900> or<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.110> an

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
enemy hunter killer drone in the air you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
enemy hunter killer drone in the air you
can<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.630> toss<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.930> trophy<00:01:19.229> system<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.590> until

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
can just toss a trophy system out until

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.109 
can just toss a trophy system out until
it<00:01:19.979> destroys<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> hunter<00:01:20.640> killer<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
hunter killer goes for someone else so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
hunter killer goes for someone else so
technically<00:01:23.970> should<00:01:24.270> never<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.750> die<00:01:24.900> from

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.350 
grenade you can also throw down a trophy
system<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.579> actually<00:01:32.759> shoot<00:01:33.210> the

grenade right off of you also something
that<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.400> found<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> throw

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that I found out is that when you throw

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.120 
that I found out is that when you throw
an<00:01:36.720> EMP<00:01:37.079> directly<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.530> atrophies<00:01:37.860> stone

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
an EMP directly at atrophies stone

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
an EMP directly at atrophies stone
within<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.430> line<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> sight<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.479> trophy

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
within this line of sight the trophy

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
within this line of sight the trophy
system<00:01:40.020> destroys<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> however<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.610> throw

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
system destroys it however if you throw

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
system destroys it however if you throw
an<00:01:41.850> EMP<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> trope<00:01:42.659> system<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
an EMP and the trope system is on the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.510 
an EMP and the trope system is on the
other<00:01:43.350> side<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> wall<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.009> something<00:01:44.280> like

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
other side of the wall or something like

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
other side of the wall or something like
that<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.240> EP<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.930> destroy<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that the EP will actually destroy the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.719 
that the EP will actually destroy the
trophy<00:01:46.710> system<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.399> what<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.579> guys<00:01:47.670> think

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
trophy system but what do you guys think

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.850 
trophy system but what do you guys think
about<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> whole<00:01:48.299> glitch<00:01:48.810> aspect<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> or

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
about the whole glitch aspect of it or

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
about the whole glitch aspect of it or
is<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.310> even<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> glitch<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.630> may

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
is this even the glitch at all that may

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060 
is this even the glitch at all that may
need<00:01:51.899> some<00:01:52.110> patching<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
need some patching or is this just a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
need some patching or is this just a
good<00:01:53.250> strategy<00:01:53.490> when<00:01:53.850> using<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.570> don't

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
good strategy when using because I don't

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.270 
good strategy when using because I don't
see<00:01:55.200> many<00:01:55.350> people<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.710> even<00:01:55.950> using<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
see many people are even using the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.620 
see many people are even using the
trophy<00:01:56.460> system<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.479> think

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
trophy system at all so I don't think

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
trophy system at all so I don't think
many<00:01:57.840> people<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.799> glitch<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
many people know about this glitch and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
many people know about this glitch and
are<00:01:59.640> taking<00:01:59.759> advantage<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.079> may

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
are taking advantage of it so this may

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.749 
are taking advantage of it so this may
add<00:02:01.560> some<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:01.890> incentive<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.549> players

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
add some more incentive to get players

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
add some more incentive to get players
to<00:02:02.969> using<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> including<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> guys<00:02:04.110> actually

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
to using it including you guys actually

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
to using it including you guys actually
now<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.189> guys<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.790> do

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
now that you guys know that it can do

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580 
now that you guys know that it can do
this<00:02:06.119> does<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.450> add<00:02:06.600> any<00:02:06.899> more<00:02:07.020> incentive<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this does this add any more incentive to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.139 
this does this add any more incentive to
get<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.920> guys<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.220> use<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.520> let<00:02:08.910> me<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.000> what
