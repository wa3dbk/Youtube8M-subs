00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 we will see today small 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.179
 wrinkle five triple tricks tips says 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.599
 riddick the crypt tips what about 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.599
 photoshop 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.939
 hello and welcome to this appointment 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.310
 summer of f1 4 which is titled at the corner 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.060
 of f1 4 first of all let's talk 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.529
 of selection 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.050
 it is often difficult to make a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.320
 selection especially a selection in 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.610
 ellipse since where you click you 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.089
 never know what can you 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.790
 to have 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.080
 and you are there you are you know 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.730
 obviously by pressing shift you 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.019
 have a round and north visits is bad 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.629
 placed how I can do but in 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.820
 staying leaning with your left clique 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.829
 by doing your you press the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.070
 space key and you can move 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.390
 Your selection here once your 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.760
 selection is made you can 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.859
 also obviously move it like that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.449
 but you can changed you make a 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.390
 right click in your selection and you 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.680
 have transformed the selection and there you 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.899
 you have all the tools of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.179
 usual transformation could turn 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.950
 and you can make it a 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:11.570
 perspective here you can change 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.550
 whatever you want i will you 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 show a little trick to do some 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.360
 the image transformation we call 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.729
 in fact of the scale based on the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.950
 contents 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.310
 if I do a normal deformation with 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.800
 control t if I increase my image you 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.890
 see that deforms blocked obviously in 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.130
 Content-based scaling edition 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.640
 here I do the same thing and you already see 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.810
 that it distorts a lot less 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.690
 we have characters who are already 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.729
 not bad but we still see that the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.149
 character is a little deformed what is 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.179
 hassle 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.869
 and that's where we'll be able to protect 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.360
 zones 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.670
 you come to select your characters 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.399
 I come to make a small selection 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.770
 modified progressive outline at 15 pixels 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.840
 I'm doing ok I'm right-clicking on it 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.300
 and I can memorize my selection here 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.119
 who must memorize the selection I 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.190
 call him couple for example I of 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.229
 select control of and there I 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.819
 come back to do my scale based on the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.879
 contents 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.470
 mongel how do you see his mother a 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.209
 little bit vain like other times that 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.890
 not a bad thing, but it's a bit rude 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.220
 and that's where you see the little 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.879
 icon here protect and I put protect 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.290
 couple and you see here the dress is 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:34.459
 become again 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:36.530
 nor what sense with him show you on 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.879
 another picture quickly send some 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.540
 same couple on the same session 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.769
 I just selected my couple here 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.890
 do not ask what they were doing 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:51.260
 to do I will not tell you I redo 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.120
 memorized I'm waiting for the couple 2 here 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.379
 I come back to take my image my 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.760
 edition 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.989
 no it's not going to work because I do not 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.230
 am not on the right course 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.519
 obviously he's editing me is the one 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.829
 content-based 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.970
 a little thing that I say in no ya 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.590
 not very long and suddenly I was 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.389
 given the trick if you want to zoom in 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.560
 to zoom out while you're finally in 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.900
 doing a transformation done 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.150
 against the most under control - and so 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.909
 I come to do the same here you see that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.290
 completely distorts the couple and there I 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.620
 come to protect couple two states 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.549
 US 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.400
 here I go quickly on something else 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.769
 jack these months there I have eyebrows 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.359
 send back I have big eyebrows and I 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.389
 wanted to do even more expressive than 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.799
 that I'm going to show a little tip I 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.720
 come here selected my target I 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.720
 do a control I pretend control j or 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.120
 against edf for me suddenly for 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.120
 duplicate this part of the calq and I 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.840
 have just edited the formations of the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.510
 marionette 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.629
 it's like a little nasty 3d that 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.019
 it's well done and I actually come 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.579
 put small pimples here by here 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.760
 actually where I'm going to do my little 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.340
 deformations game just to left click 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.209
 actually on it and I actually come from 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.439
 lot deletes it if you want in 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.579
 delete one either you the 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.260
 select you press this premium 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.799
 either you make you panting and you 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.639
 cut the cost and suddenly I can come 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.840
 the 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.150
 not even add one here like that I 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.949
 can come in fact turned into a master 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.840
 too much if you put too much it's not okay 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.240
 great market but I can come 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.060
 transform this part there I have more 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.340
 to get in and I have an eyebrow that 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.080
 is clogged for example you have to try 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.370
 to add a small smile is a 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.740
 little like useful balls and the writing 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.330
 file and kylie kylie fluidity in France 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.590
 and it's a bit like that except suddenly 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.060
 you can control does a little bit 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.650
 more easily for today 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.060
 this week for this week I hope that 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.319
 you will have learned little things from me 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.789
 I learned a lot of things while preparing 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.229
 this little episode and preparing water 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.490
 who will have others on the tips and 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.860
 so I'm telling you next week 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.860
