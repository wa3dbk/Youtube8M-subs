 maquillo me every day is a makeup 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.180
 very handy fast and with few 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.040
 products we will start once 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.529
 we have clean toned face and 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.029
 hydrated we started to address the issue of 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.250
 make up then the first thing I do 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.110
 is to use a cute concealer this 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.520
 corrector that is the marsé brand in 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.410
 I've been using it a lot 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.239
 time and serves to cover those 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.489
 imperfections that we have in the face 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.329
 for example red spots or even 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.249
 scars 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.839
 so is a apply on the nose and 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.179
 which is an area that has many small veins 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.559
 red and so we unify the tone this 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.300
 same concealer so far it was 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.799
 using to cover the area of 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.109
 dark circles but it is true that right now 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.269
 I'm trying this other product that is 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.769
 also a proofreader but in format 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.659
 liquid because those that use in 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.640
 liquid format to avoid being in 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.439
 crack the product right in the area of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.180
 dark circles what I liked to 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.429
 this product is the way to apply to 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.960
 through a little rosquita is coming out small 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.950
 dose of product on this part 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.170
 lead 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.179
 also the applicator this is like 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.310
 silicone is very soft and this area that 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.140
 It is so delicate with this applicator 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.850
 does not suffer once the product is applied 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.619
 you have two options to extend it with this 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.619
 same tip of silicone or by hand 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.540
 Once the imperfections are covered , 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.190
 that we are going to apply makeup in this 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.230
 case I use with where the esae lauder 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.820
 which is very common and especially 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.470
 lasts all day you can 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 Apply with the help of the brush or with 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.340
 your own fingers 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.890
 The next thing I do is use some 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.450
 bronzing powder to mark a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.020
 little facial features and to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 give me color 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.590
 customers the makeup of the eyes for 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.299
 it starts using a base that 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 extend all over the eyelid area 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.239
 to prevent the shadows that I will put to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.010
 then barracks below 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.780
 I will make up the eyes I will use 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.790
 for this this palette of gandhi that in 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.739
 brown tones I will use a single 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.180
 palette because the truth is taste of 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.160
 makeup I like to be very practical and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.170
 how much less pallets and less 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.670
 shadows we have better then in this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 case with all this variety of colors 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.510
 It will be more than enough so I could 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.310
 make up the eye perfectly as 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.230
 I use a single brush to apply 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.580
 all kinds of shadows in the eyes what 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.440
 first thing I do before starting is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.690
 make sure that he took away all the excesses 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.370
 that there are pigments from the previous time 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.230
 that you have used this brush for it 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 with a piece of toilet paper and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.099
 I simply move the brush or the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.870
 brush on the piece of paper 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.120
 the first shadow that I use is a 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.709
 clear shadow in color pulling to white 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.690
 a very light color to apply the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.489
 shadow normally used a piece of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.840
 toilet paper here to prevent that 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.549
 all the pigments fall out and I 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.049
 spoil anything this from more travel in 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.400
 concrete this clear shadow I'm going to 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.990
 apply throughout the whole part 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.910
 outside of the eye 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.040
 next I'm going to apply a range of 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.580
 darker color in the eyelid area 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.580
 mobile 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.640
 next I'm going to apply a shadow 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.650
 much darker on the outside 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.830
 of the mobile eyelid you are going to see forming 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.850
 a triangle 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.620
 not so much 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.930
 to 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.409
 and continued a bit the curve of 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.409
 eyelid mobile 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.670
 in the event that the shadow goes by 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.290
 areas where it does not have to be what 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.480
 I do is use olive oil and a 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.700
 stick to remove it 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.720
 so far used all matte shadows 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.090
 but then I will use 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.430
 shadows with some brightness in the area 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.170
 close to the part of the eyebrows and a 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.099
 little bit in the center of the eyelid 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.629
 higher 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.980
 the next important step is 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.019
 blur the shadows that we have 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.670
 applied over the eye to get that 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.620
 be totally uniform and be very 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.750
 pretty the colors this same palette 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.970
 incorporates a broach diffuses dora east 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.690
 concept but I will use this other 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.690
 that I also like 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.519
 you can see the difference between a 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.410
 eye that I have blurred and the other that is 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.000
 still without blurring the following would be 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.770
 delineate the eye you can use a 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 eyeliner or an eyeliner but if 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.190
 we want to continue using the same 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.720
 palette we can do this wet the brush 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.940
 with a little water and about the color 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.940
 darker you get a little bit of product 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.950
 to finish making up the area of 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.060
 the eyes we lack the mask in this 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.040
 case the writer is called 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.640
 he plays valium and what he does is give 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.640
 more volume 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.580
 in the face I like to apply a touch 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.230
 of color in the area of ​​the cheeks to 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.000
 he used this nash product that 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.620
 It is multiple that has several uses 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.940
 one of them precisely apply in 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.110
 the area of ​​the cheeks with a little 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.110
 of product like that with your finger 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.569
 finally the area of ​​the lips what 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.740
 I usually do is use the same 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.689
 proofreader who has taught you to 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.580
 nash principle I apply it a little bit 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.919
 on the lips and I am we have very 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.509
 normal but to lower the tone of the lip 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.509
 finally I apply lipstick 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.539
 and until we've arrived with this 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.800
 makeup that I know I use every day 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.479
 in which you follow my blog is the one 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.280
