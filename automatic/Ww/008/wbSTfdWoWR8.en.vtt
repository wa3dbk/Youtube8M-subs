00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hi everyone! How are you? 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.759
 law there and in this video I will teach 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.610
 You, how to make this beautiful one that does not 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.680
 have reggae with galaxy mustache 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 Super cute 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.330
 so you're going to need a shirt 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.369
 with a sheet of sulphite and a pencil and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.619
 white paper sheets sulphite in the middle and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.689
 Let's draw the mustache. 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 If you can not draw you can 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.160
 take the drawing from the internet 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.040
 so I found it easier to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.500
 me to do it this way 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:50.070
 and then after drawing I'll cut the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:53.340
 mustache and then I'm going to take the middle 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.360
 this part that we do not use much 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 cute little 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.109
 and then I'm going to use that other part here and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 red and white blue fabric paint and 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.770
 I'll start with a sponge I'll go 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.750
 start the sponge giving the color white 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.729
 can be expanded from crockery sponges 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 makeup is any sponge you can 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 making this effect is very easy to do 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.600
 then the white color I will sponge the color 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600
 blue 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:30.399
 and then the color blue I will sponja the color 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.590
 red and a red with blue goes 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:42.070
 give a half-purple tone that's what we 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:45.159
 either and after sponge well blend well 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 all the colors there you take the paper that 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.079
 We 're going to make the stars with a 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.079
 toothpick and white fabric paint 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.580
 So you're going to make some balls. 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.580
 other smaller ones 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.830
 as you can see there is not much 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.780
 The secret to doing is super 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.489
 This little mustache is there when you're done. 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 to make the stars you're going to leave 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.260
 dry for half an hour and then we'll go 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.299
 cut 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.200
 I'm cutting two fingers counting 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.200
 original collar 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.739
 and then I'm going to cut amanda too 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:52.250
 two fingers into the seam 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:54.829
 original and then I'll cut the bar 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 I'm cutting four fingers if you 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.790
 I want to cut shorter everything okay but 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.829
 when four fingers first and then 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.239
 you shorten according to your 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.250
 I like it and then you get where you 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.859
 You cut you give it a stretch like that. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.840
 that treatment will get better 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.939
 the type of plan will give a one - two 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.790
 will get better finish and he 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.590
 is ready to our super super t-shirt 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.389
 beautiful shirt I loved it 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.829
