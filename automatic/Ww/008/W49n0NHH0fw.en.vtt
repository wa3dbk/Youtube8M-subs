00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.430
 here I am riding on angie sfg 6f 600's 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.990
 80 horses moment warned that the 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.560
 direction was very hard level 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.560
 sounds 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.449
 yeah 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.760
 I let you judge 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.760
 [Music] 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.080
 me 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.210
 for it's really very hard and it's this 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.260
 which surprises the most 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.969
 wow this is the direction that is where lola 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.680
 really surprising 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.350
 it really can not be done 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.399
 it's really hard 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.180
 the clutch safe but no gas 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.180
 he immediately takes 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.820
 but you really have to fight with the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820
 motorbike 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.320
 to ride and tomorrow it's feasible 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 manicure I have to fight with the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 handlebar 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.270
 Wow 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.880
 Well, we have to put a lot of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 strength in arms 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.980
 it may surprise 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.930
 and again I'm always in first 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.930
 and second what 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.350
 except that it makes very nice noise 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.350
 must understand the direction 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.030
 very nice sound of all fours 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.030
 that we can not say the opposite 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.650
 and here it is not really a bike that 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.650
 I will want to have every day 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.400
 really tells you to fight 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.360
 with the direction the withdrawal of pushing 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 all my strength and my left arm 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.260
 I'm going to him or me 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.640

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.230
 on the tank even at the level of the arms 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.220
 but it's really not much less 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.220
 handy than other motorcycles 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.730
