megapixel CMOS sensor the sensor size on
the<00:00:46.790> 70d<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:47.540> also<00:00:48.110> slightly<00:00:48.350> larger<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.160> it's

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
the 70d is also slightly larger and it's

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.540 
the 70d is also slightly larger and it's
got<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.670> digit<00:00:50.120> 5<00:00:50.329> processor<00:00:51.110> whereas<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.739> B<00:00:52.040> 70

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
got the digit 5 processor whereas a B 70

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.110 
got the digit 5 processor whereas a B 70

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
has the dual digit 4 processor so you

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.790 
has the dual digit 4 processor so you
know<00:00:56.420> you've<00:00:56.600> got<00:00:56.780> some<00:00:56.930> slightly<00:00:57.470> improved

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
know you've got some slightly improved

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.549 
know you've got some slightly improved
specs<00:00:58.130> here<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.579> a<00:00:58.640> d7<00:00:59.450> TD<00:00:59.840> something<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.380> bear

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
specs here on a d7 TD something to bear

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.960 
specs here on a d7 TD something to bear
in<00:01:00.649> mind<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.950> both<00:01:01.130> of<00:01:01.309> these<00:01:01.399> are<00:01:01.610> crop

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
in mind is both of these are crop

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.190 
in mind is both of these are crop
sensors<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:02.480> you've<00:01:02.570> not<00:01:02.690> got<00:01:02.870> full-frame

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
sensors so you've not got full-frame

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.259 
sensors so you've not got full-frame
sensors<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.739> here<00:01:03.950> looking<00:01:04.549> at<00:01:04.670> autofocus

however<00:03:55.519> on<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.970> 7d<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:57.079> do<00:03:57.230> have<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.769> 4

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
however on the 7d you do have a 4

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.339 
however on the 7d you do have a 4
gigabyte<00:03:58.370> cutoff<00:03:59.000> limit<00:03:59.389> so<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.900> will<00:04:00.049> stop

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
gigabyte cutoff limit so it will stop

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.170 
gigabyte cutoff limit so it will stop
after<00:04:00.560> filming<00:04:01.010> 4k<00:04:01.430> passive<00:04:01.790> data

I'm<00:04:02.629> the<00:04:03.019> on<00:04:03.169> 1080p<00:04:03.769> that's<00:04:04.099> roughly<00:04:04.400> about<00:04:04.669> 12

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
I'm the on 1080p that's roughly about 12

I'm the on 1080p that's roughly about 12
minutes<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.260> 70d<00:04:06.769> on<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:07.040> other<00:04:07.190> hand<00:04:07.430> it

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
minutes on the 70d on the other hand it

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.699 
minutes on the 70d on the other hand it
will<00:04:08.000> continue<00:04:08.510> for<00:04:08.720> me<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.079> we'll<00:04:09.290> have<00:04:09.440> four

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
will continue for me so we'll have four

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.530 
will continue for me so we'll have four
gigabyte<00:04:10.310> chunks<00:04:10.699> but<00:04:10.849> it'll<00:04:11.060> automatically

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
gigabyte chunks but it'll automatically

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.809 
gigabyte chunks but it'll automatically
move<00:04:11.900> on<00:04:12.139> to<00:04:12.379> those<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:13.129> for<00:04:13.310> instance<00:04:13.549> if<00:04:13.699> you

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
move on to those so for instance if you

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.819 
move on to those so for instance if you
are<00:04:13.849> 4<00:04:14.120> min<00:04:14.239> 29<00:04:14.629> minutes<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:14.959> 59<00:04:15.260> seconds

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
are 4 min 29 minutes and 59 seconds

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.409 
are 4 min 29 minutes and 59 seconds
you'll<00:04:16.159> have<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.519> for<00:04:16.789> diff<00:04:16.970> for<00:04:17.120> 3<00:04:17.299> different

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
you'll have a for diff for 3 different

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.360 
you'll have a for diff for 3 different
files<00:04:17.780> which<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.530> can<00:04:18.709> put<00:04:18.919> together<00:04:19.070> and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
files which you can put together and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.659 
files which you can put together and
post<00:04:19.579> later<00:04:19.880> on<00:04:20.030> but<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:21.380> 70d<00:04:22.099> does<00:04:22.310> have<00:04:22.520> this

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
post later on but the 70d does have this

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.089 
post later on but the 70d does have this
advantage<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.300> longer<00:04:24.080> recording<00:04:24.469> times<00:04:24.770> now

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
advantage of longer recording times now

W F te v this is pretty expensive you're

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.909 
W F te v this is pretty expensive you're
looking<00:05:10.639> roughly<00:05:11.450> about<00:05:11.570> 400<00:05:12.169> to<00:05:12.260> 450<00:05:12.710> pounds

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
looking roughly about 400 to 450 pounds

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.879 
looking roughly about 400 to 450 pounds
in<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.400> UK<00:05:13.430> roughly<00:05:14.300> about<00:05:14.389> $700<00:05:15.290> in<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.530> u.s.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
in the UK roughly about $700 in the u.s.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.110 
in the UK roughly about $700 in the u.s.
so<00:05:16.010> that's<00:05:16.160> going<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.340> set<00:05:16.520> you<00:05:16.639> back<00:05:16.669> quite<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
so that's going to set you back quite a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.930 
so that's going to set you back quite a
bit<00:05:17.419> but<00:05:17.870> then<00:05:18.050> again<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.620> 7d<00:05:19.100> isn't<00:05:19.729> all<00:05:19.820> the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
bit but then again the 7d isn't all the

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.450 
bit but then again the 7d isn't all the
camera<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.750> 70d<00:05:21.260> has<00:05:21.500> this<00:05:21.680> built<00:05:21.950> in<00:05:22.130> which

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
camera the 70d has this built in which

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.730 
camera the 70d has this built in which
is<00:05:22.610> absolutely<00:05:23.360> great<00:05:23.660> now<00:05:24.139> in<00:05:24.320> terms<00:05:24.560> of

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
is absolutely great now in terms of

twenty grams D 70d seven hundred and
fifty<00:05:29.660> five<00:05:30.020> grams<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:30.440> this<00:05:30.590> 70<00:05:30.950> D<00:05:31.070> is<00:05:31.280> a<00:05:31.789> more

fifty five grams so this 70 D is a more

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.060 
fifty five grams so this 70 D is a more
