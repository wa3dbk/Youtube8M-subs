00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.760

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 and as we are doing it this way the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.620

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.210
 after we all have them here in the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.020
 pot we put the paper we throw it 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.020
 slowly 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.400
 delicious 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.880
 this paper was already prepared this 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.880
 panela 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 now we place the sugar because as 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.770
 has enough gold paper then 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.330
 we are going to place it is a teaspoon 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.620
 nothing else 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.270
 now I come with the guayabita 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.390
 and the cinnamon that we are going to place 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.740
 we put it on the stove so that it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.740
 cook and cover it 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.560
 well now let's see the sweet that already 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.560
 is 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.940
 well we already combined with the work of the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.020
 milky now we go with the fritters 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.420
 for the fritters my friend is my frame 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.750
 neighbor for this recipe we are going to 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:12.060
 need cassava is previously cooked 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.430
 cheese eggs and a point of salt 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.980
 this sweet is prepared for many years 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.110
 back which I have learned from me 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.870
 grandmother of four years 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.140
 now we are going to proceed to crush the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.140
 truffle 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.000
 My grandmother previously said that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.240
 Yucca died directly with the cheese 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.840
 on a stone or in a good mill at 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.520
 when cassava is cooked and 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.890
 they sting in half we take away the 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.260
 oatmeal from the middle of the stick that has 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.360
 so that they do not have a better 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.430
 cooking and peels off faster from 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.750
 very small I have paid attention to how 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.150
 our grandmother prepares us not to lose 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.070
 tradition in the cooking method 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.660
 trying to rescue him and at the same time 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.660
 keep it so you do not miss 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.409
 once we have elqui this we are going to 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.409
 proceed to place the egg 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.130
 we are fine until we incorporate all the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.200
 ingredients 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.260
 is the texture that we should have for 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.880
 make the yucca balls then in the 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.880
 oil when heating 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.800
 the yucca balls are ready now 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.800
 we proceed 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 hot 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.060

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.600

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.490
 place the pretty ones and from that same side 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.370

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.280
 that this to maintain the tradition of 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.050
 our parents of our grandparents already 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.510

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.870
