00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.799 

so<00:00:07.330> how<00:00:08.330> do<00:00:08.390> we<00:00:08.480> start<00:00:08.870> well<00:00:09.370> I've

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
so how do we start well I've

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.450 
so how do we start well I've
deliberately<00:00:11.809> not<00:00:12.230> this<00:00:12.380> way<00:00:12.650> out<00:00:12.830> of<00:00:13.040> turn<00:00:13.310> I

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
deliberately not this way out of turn I

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
deliberately not this way out of turn I
move<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.210> bridge<00:00:15.400> so<00:00:16.400> this<00:00:16.550> is<00:00:16.700> as<00:00:16.820> if<00:00:17.000> I<00:00:17.300> was

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
move the bridge so this is as if I was

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.320 
move the bridge so this is as if I was
setting<00:00:17.869> up<00:00:17.960> a<00:00:18.650> brand<00:00:19.369> new<00:00:19.430> guitar<00:00:19.730> that<00:00:20.119> I've

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
setting up a brand new guitar that I've

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.140 
setting up a brand new guitar that I've
made<00:00:21.849> my<00:00:22.849> bridges<00:00:23.450> are<00:00:23.689> what<00:00:24.939> referred<00:00:25.939> to<00:00:26.060> as

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
made my bridges are what referred to as

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.700 
made my bridges are what referred to as
floating<00:00:26.509> bridges<00:00:26.989> in<00:00:27.259> other<00:00:27.380> words<00:00:27.560> they're

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
floating bridges in other words they're

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.819 
floating bridges in other words they're
not<00:00:27.739> glued<00:00:28.220> down<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.610> prefer<00:00:29.390> that<00:00:29.750> way<00:00:29.989> because

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
not glued down I prefer that way because

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.770 
not glued down I prefer that way because
it<00:00:31.099> allows<00:00:31.430> me<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:32.620> fine-tune<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:35.000> correct

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
it allows me to fine-tune the correct

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.160 
it allows me to fine-tune the correct
intonation<00:00:36.969> if<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.210> bridge<00:00:38.390> gets<00:00:38.660> damaged

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
intonation if the bridge gets damaged

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.310 
intonation if the bridge gets damaged
it's<00:00:39.469> easily<00:00:39.710> replaced<00:00:40.460> if<00:00:41.420> you<00:00:41.539> want<00:00:41.719> I<00:00:42.109> have

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
it's easily replaced if you want I have

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.990 
it's easily replaced if you want I have
one<00:00:42.769> with<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.920> higher<00:00:43.100> action<00:00:43.640> or<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.789> lower

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
one with a higher action or a lower

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.700 
one with a higher action or a lower
action<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:45.440> can<00:00:45.620> simply<00:00:45.859> take<00:00:46.039> it<00:00:46.250> off<00:00:47.559> if<00:00:48.559> you

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
action you can simply take it off if you

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.040 
action you can simply take it off if you
borrow<00:00:48.980> one<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.219> these<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:50.570> have<00:00:50.719> moved

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
borrow one of these and you have moved

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.540 
borrow one of these and you have moved
the<00:00:51.199> bridge<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:51.800> you<00:00:51.949> want<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.160> change<00:00:52.399> the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the bridge and you want to change the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.060 
the bridge and you want to change the
strings<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.239> easiest<00:00:53.719> way<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.320> just<00:00:54.710> to

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
strings and the easiest way is just to

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.579 
strings and the easiest way is just to
take<00:00:55.339> one<00:00:55.640> string<00:00:56.000> off<00:00:56.149> at<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.690> time<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.410> really

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
take one string off at a time and really

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.380 
take one string off at a time and really
place<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:59.499> without<00:01:00.499> moving<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.160> bridge<00:01:01.399> but

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
place it without moving the bridge but

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.450 
place it without moving the bridge but
if<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:02.960> got<00:01:03.140> moved<00:01:03.440> accidentally<00:01:04.159> or<00:01:04.339> you

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
if it's got moved accidentally or you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.680 
if it's got moved accidentally or you
start<00:01:04.699> from<00:01:04.909> scratch

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
start from scratch

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.050 
start from scratch
you<00:01:05.960> need<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.350> know<00:01:06.500> where<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.040> bridge<00:01:07.340> is

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
you need to know where that bridge is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.850 
you need to know where that bridge is
position<00:01:08.600> or<00:01:08.720> not<00:01:08.930> there's<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.380> Seminole<00:01:09.740> buddy

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
position or not there's a Seminole buddy

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.070 
position or not there's a Seminole buddy
as<00:01:10.040> well<00:01:10.310> as<00:01:10.490> off<00:01:10.640> anything<00:01:11.180> like<00:01:11.450> we're<00:01:11.900> going

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
as well as off anything like we're going

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.630 
as well as off anything like we're going
to<00:01:12.170> do<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.440> by<00:01:12.940> yeah<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.350> I've<00:01:15.620> just<00:01:16.160> put<00:01:16.400> it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
to do it by yeah so I've just put it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.200 
to do it by yeah so I've just put it
there

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
there

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.370 
there
roughly<00:01:17.810> position<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.680> mine<00:01:18.860> tend<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.490> be

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
roughly position the mine tend to be

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.320 
roughly position the mine tend to be
rough<00:01:21.380> about<00:01:21.560> 1/3<00:01:22.190> or<00:01:22.400> length<00:01:22.580> of<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.850> box<00:01:23.090> but

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
rough about 1/3 or length of the box but

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.900 
rough about 1/3 or length of the box but
it's<00:01:23.540> not<00:01:23.750> always<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.230> case<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.610> just<00:01:25.730> need

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
it's not always the case so we just need

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.050 
it's not always the case so we just need
a<00:01:25.970> starting<00:01:26.570> point<00:01:29.140> don't<00:01:30.140> attempt<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:31.060> bring

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
a starting point don't attempt to bring

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.180 
a starting point don't attempt to bring
the<00:01:32.090> strings<00:01:32.570> up<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.990> full<00:01:33.290> tension<00:01:33.950> at<00:01:34.040> this

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
the strings up to full tension at this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.950 
the strings up to full tension at this
point<00:01:34.550> it<00:01:34.790> just<00:01:34.820> makes<00:01:35.180> things<00:01:35.450> harder<00:01:35.930> for

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
point it just makes things harder for

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.530 
point it just makes things harder for
you<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.380> can<00:01:36.530> just<00:01:36.680> tune<00:01:36.980> it<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.540> basically

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
you you can just tune it to basically

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.970 
you you can just tune it to basically
anything<00:01:40.900> without<00:01:41.900> too<00:01:42.140> much<00:01:42.290> tension<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.920> it

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
anything without too much tension on it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.240 
anything without too much tension on it
just<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:43.940> get<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.300> positioning<00:01:44.900> of<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:47.020> so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
just to get the positioning of that so

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.400 
just to get the positioning of that so
let's<00:01:49.250> see<00:01:49.400> what<00:01:49.790> I've<00:01:50.000> got<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.450> there<00:01:50.750> this

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
let's see what I've got on there this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.200 
let's see what I've got on there this
little<00:01:51.710> tuning<00:01:52.160> device<00:01:52.520> will<00:01:52.790> tell<00:01:53.030> me

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
little tuning device will tell me

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.140 
little tuning device will tell me
exactly<00:01:54.080> what<00:01:54.710> no

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
exactly what no

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.140 
exactly what no
that's<00:01:56.780> actually<00:01:57.350> not<00:01:57.650> so<00:01:58.040> funny<00:01:58.580> but<00:01:58.940> it's

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
that's actually not so funny but it's

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.780 
that's actually not so funny but it's
going<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.660> present<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.030> sake<00:02:02.270> argument

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.050 

I'm<00:02:07.790> sure<00:02:08.060> naturally<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.700> doubt<00:02:10.700> whether<00:02:10.910> you

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
I'm sure naturally I doubt whether you

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.800 
I'm sure naturally I doubt whether you
could<00:02:11.270> see<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.780> but<00:02:11.960> when<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> play<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.790> know

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
could see that but when I play that know

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.620 
could see that but when I play that know
the<00:02:14.810> little<00:02:15.110> little<00:02:15.620> needle<00:02:16.270> goes<00:02:17.270> up<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the little little needle goes up to the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.380 
the little little needle goes up to the
center<00:02:18.050> there<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.740> tells<00:02:18.950> me<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.390> that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
center there and it tells me that that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
center there and it tells me that that
is<00:02:20.420> an<00:02:20.720> e<00:02:20.840> note<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:25.210> twelfth<00:02:26.210> fret<00:02:26.420> if<00:02:27.080> we

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
is an e note so the twelfth fret if we

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
is an e note so the twelfth fret if we
play<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:29.390> should<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.930> exactly<00:02:30.530> an<00:02:31.010> octave

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
play that it should be exactly an octave

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.480 
play that it should be exactly an octave
higher<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.720> knee<00:02:32.870> note<00:02:33.080> again<00:02:33.470> bought<00:02:33.710> twice

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
higher the knee note again bought twice

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.560 
higher the knee note again bought twice
the<00:02:34.700> frequency<00:02:35.320> an<00:02:36.320> octave<00:02:36.740> higher<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.570> I'm

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
the frequency an octave higher and I'm

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.760 
the frequency an octave higher and I'm
simply<00:02:38.900> going<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.440> try<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.040> find<00:02:40.370> where<00:02:40.940> that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
simply going to try and find where that

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.650 
simply going to try and find where that
octave<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.670> string<00:02:44.030> because<00:02:44.390> if<00:02:44.510> this

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
octave is on the string because if this

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.080 
octave is on the string because if this
position<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> wrong<00:02:45.650> place<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.850> won't

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
position is in the wrong place it won't

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.750 
position is in the wrong place it won't
lie<00:02:47.330> on<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.110> twelfth<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.130> then<00:02:49.370> I'm<00:02:49.520> going<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
lie on the twelfth and then I'm going to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.030 
lie on the twelfth and then I'm going to
move<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.360> bridge<00:02:50.630> until<00:02:51.200> I've<00:02:51.380> known<00:02:51.620> does<00:02:51.890> it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
move the bridge until I've known does it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.770 
move the bridge until I've known does it
appear<00:02:52.340> there<00:02:52.550> banging<00:02:53.120> over<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> twelfth

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
appear there banging over the twelfth

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.820 
appear there banging over the twelfth
fret<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.390> use<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.620> little

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
fret I like to use the little

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.620 
fret I like to use the little
screwdriver<00:02:58.300> rather<00:02:59.300> than<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.660> slide<00:02:59.990> because

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
screwdriver rather than a slide because

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.190 
screwdriver rather than a slide because
being<00:03:02.630> narrow<00:03:03.500> diameter<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.760> allows<00:03:05.060> me<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.300> be

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
being narrow diameter it allows me to be

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.930 
being narrow diameter it allows me to be
more<00:03:06.380> accurate<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.700> nice

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
more accurate with it so this is a nice

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.370 
more accurate with it so this is a nice
smooth<00:03:08.360> Pro<00:03:09.160> screwdriver<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.670> job<00:03:10.880> nicely

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
smooth Pro screwdriver just a job nicely

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:20.050 
smooth Pro screwdriver just a job nicely

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
around the twelfth fret we should hear

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.510 
around the twelfth fret we should hear
the<00:03:22.070> same<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.580> an<00:03:22.730> octave<00:03:23.030> higher<00:03:27.370> if<00:03:28.370> you

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
the same not an octave higher if you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.550 
the same not an octave higher if you
move<00:03:28.730> down<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.580> soon<00:03:32.239> find<00:03:32.720> well<00:03:32.989> notice

my is tell me this somewhere there which
is<00:03:44.439> actually<00:03:44.590> between<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.159> 11th<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.939> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
is actually between the 11th and the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.960 
is actually between the 11th and the
12th<00:03:46.200> fret<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.860> as<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.069> said<00:03:48.280> earlier<00:03:48.610> we<00:03:48.760> want

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
12th fret and as I said earlier we want

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.940 
12th fret and as I said earlier we want
it<00:03:49.120> back<00:03:49.299> on<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.599> 12th<00:03:51.420> if<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.569> can't<00:03:52.810> tell<00:03:53.590> by

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
it back on the 12th if you can't tell by

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.580 
it back on the 12th if you can't tell by
using<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:54.519> ears<00:03:54.760> use<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:55.599> tuner<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.379> you'll

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
using your ears use a tuner and you'll

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.369 
using your ears use a tuner and you'll
you'll<00:03:57.159> know<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:57.909> apply<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.959> similar

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
you'll know just apply the similar

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.809 
you'll know just apply the similar
amount<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.709> pressure<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.159> you<00:04:00.220> might<00:04:00.549> have<00:04:00.790> a

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
amount of pressure that you might have a

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.580 
amount of pressure that you might have a
few<00:04:01.060> years<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.510> slide<00:04:01.840> because<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.290> will

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
few years in a slide because I will

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
few years in a slide because I will
stretch<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.190> string<00:04:03.489> slightly<00:04:04.709> alter<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.799> so

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
stretch the string slightly alter it so

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.569 
stretch the string slightly alter it so
on<00:04:08.260> this<00:04:08.470> guitar<00:04:08.620> as<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.730> say<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.629> 12th<00:04:11.250> note<00:04:12.250> is

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
on this guitar as I say the 12th note is

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.309 
on this guitar as I say the 12th note is
coming<00:04:13.000> somewhere<00:04:13.389> between<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.930> 11th<00:04:14.260> and

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
coming somewhere between the 11th and

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.289 
coming somewhere between the 11th and
the<00:04:14.470> 12th<00:04:14.500> fret<00:04:15.040> which<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.340> no<00:04:15.639> good<00:04:15.909> be<00:04:16.000> one<00:04:16.120> on

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
the 12th fret which is no good be one on

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.469 
the 12th fret which is no good be one on
the<00:04:16.419> 12th<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.799> if<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.669> find<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.180> know<00:04:19.419> it

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
the 12th so if you find that you know it

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.750 
the 12th so if you find that you know it
is<00:04:19.660> below<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.139> 12th<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:21.070> means<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.639> the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
is below the 12th that means that the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.840 
is below the 12th that means that the
bridge<00:04:22.350> needs<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.560> move<00:04:23.800> away<00:04:24.100> from<00:04:24.310> it

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
bridge needs to move away from it

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.529 
bridge needs to move away from it
basically<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.900> lengthen<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:28.510> distance

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
basically to lengthen the distance

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.320 
basically to lengthen the distance
between<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.410> bridge<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.979> knot<00:04:30.330> which

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
between the bridge and the knot which

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.439 
between the bridge and the knot which
will<00:04:31.630> move<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.610> octave<00:04:33.610> position<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:35.470> way

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
will move the octave position this way

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.930 
will move the octave position this way
and<00:04:37.449> you'll<00:04:37.900> need<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.260> move<00:04:38.410> that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
and you'll need to move that

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
and you'll need to move that
approximately<00:04:39.940> twice<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.570> distance<00:04:41.280> that

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
approximately twice the distance that

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.189 
approximately twice the distance that
that<00:04:44.130> position<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.820> out<00:04:46.690> by<00:04:48.630> if<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.900> found

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
that position is out by if you found

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.460 
that position is out by if you found
that<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.620> 12th<00:04:51.099> note<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.660> sort<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.139> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
that the 12th note that sort of the the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.560 
that the 12th note that sort of the the
octave<00:04:55.470> was<00:04:56.470> above<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.860> 12th<00:04:57.250> fret<00:04:57.460> then<00:04:58.389> that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
octave was above the 12th fret then that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.810 
octave was above the 12th fret then that
means<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.199> scale<00:04:59.590> length<00:04:59.889> is<00:05:00.099> too<00:05:00.460> long

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
means that the scale length is too long

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.629 
means that the scale length is too long
the<00:05:01.690> bridge<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:02.110> too<00:05:02.139> far<00:05:02.650> back<00:05:02.919> and<00:05:03.190> you<00:05:03.370> need

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
the bridge is too far back and you need

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.659 
the bridge is too far back and you need
to<00:05:03.760> move<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.120> bridge<00:05:04.300> forward<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.460> bring<00:05:06.460> that

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
to move the bridge forward to bring that

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.740 
to move the bridge forward to bring that
down<00:05:07.169> very<00:05:08.169> run<00:05:08.470> out<00:05:08.650> on<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.949> camera<00:05:09.190> so<00:05:09.750> jump

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
down very run out on the camera so jump

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
that position bang over the 12th fret

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.640 
that position bang over the 12th fret

man<00:05:27.210> still<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.240> little<00:05:29.220> bit<00:05:30.220> below<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.940> twelfth

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
man still a little bit below the twelfth

slide<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:34.420> bridge<00:05:34.630> back<00:05:34.870> try<00:05:35.560> again<00:05:47.100> that's

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
slide the bridge back try again that's

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.560 
slide the bridge back try again that's
about<00:05:48.310> right<00:05:48.640> now<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:51.220> doesn't<00:05:51.490> have<00:05:51.730> to<00:05:51.880> be<00:05:52.000> to

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
about right now it doesn't have to be to

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.540 
about right now it doesn't have to be to
the<00:05:52.750> exact<00:05:53.380> millimetre<00:05:53.710> because<00:05:54.390> plane<00:05:55.390> slide

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
the exact millimetre because plane slide

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.510 
the exact millimetre because plane slide
he'd<00:05:57.550> do<00:05:57.730> most<00:05:57.940> of<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.150> by<00:05:58.300> ear<00:05:58.570> anyway<00:05:59.400> but<00:06:00.400> it

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
he'd do most of it by ear anyway but it

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.750 
he'd do most of it by ear anyway but it
is<00:06:00.730> nice<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:00.970> have<00:06:01.180> it<00:06:01.240> set<00:06:02.140> up<00:06:02.169> correctly<00:06:02.760> I

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
is nice to have it set up correctly I

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.330 
is nice to have it set up correctly I
can<00:06:04.330> tell<00:06:04.960> pretty<00:06:05.200> much<00:06:05.440> from<00:06:05.890> listening<00:06:06.280> to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
can tell pretty much from listening to

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.280 
can tell pretty much from listening to
that<00:06:06.550> that<00:06:06.790> it's<00:06:06.940> correct<00:06:07.300> but<00:06:07.480> if<00:06:08.020> you're

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
that that it's correct but if you're

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.130 
that that it's correct but if you're
unsure<00:06:08.470> use<00:06:09.070> the<00:06:09.280> chillner<00:06:09.850> set<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:10.780> open

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
over the twelfth and it should still

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.980 
over the twelfth and it should still

the bridge and the twelfth fret on the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
twelfth fret and then naught should be

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
twelfth fret and then naught should be
equal<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:37.120> doesn't<00:06:37.419> really<00:06:37.540> matter<00:06:37.810> if<00:06:38.520> you

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
equal it doesn't really matter if you

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.730 
equal it doesn't really matter if you
measure<00:06:39.760> if<00:06:40.000> it<00:06:40.150> isn't<00:06:40.450> what<00:06:41.050> counts<00:06:41.290> is<00:06:41.560> what

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
measure if it isn't what counts is what

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.190 
measure if it isn't what counts is what
it<00:06:41.890> sounds<00:06:42.370> like<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:43.330> that<00:06:43.540> sounds<00:06:43.900> fine<00:06:44.140> to

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
it sounds like and that sounds fine to

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.700 
it sounds like and that sounds fine to
me

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
me

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.140 
me
so<00:06:45.840> that's<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:47.050> intonation<00:06:47.500> set<00:06:48.100> you<00:06:48.729> need<00:06:48.970> to

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
so that's the intonation set you need to

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.750 
so that's the intonation set you need to
do<00:06:49.300> that<00:06:49.630> need<00:06:50.530> to<00:06:50.680> have<00:06:50.800> that<00:06:50.979> right<00:06:51.250> before

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
do that need to have that right before

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.290 
do that need to have that right before
you<00:06:51.820> try<00:06:52.060> tuning<00:06:52.600> it<00:06:52.720> to<00:06:52.900> your<00:06:53.710> open<00:06:54.300> chord

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
you try tuning it to your open chord

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.270 
you try tuning it to your open chord
because<00:06:55.630> it<00:06:55.750> just<00:06:55.840> it<00:06:56.200> just<00:06:56.410> won't<00:06:56.590> play<00:06:56.979> right

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
because it just it just won't play right

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.350 
because it just it just won't play right
it<00:06:57.490> will<00:06:57.640> sound<00:06:58.110> okay<00:06:59.110> on<00:06:59.260> the<00:06:59.380> open<00:06:59.740> strings

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
it will sound okay on the open strings

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.810 
it will sound okay on the open strings
but<00:07:01.360> as<00:07:01.510> soon<00:07:01.750> as<00:07:01.870> you<00:07:02.080> go<00:07:02.979> up<00:07:03.130> the<00:07:03.340> neck<00:07:03.550> with

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
but as soon as you go up the neck with

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.000 
but as soon as you go up the neck with
your<00:07:03.970> slide<00:07:04.240> and<00:07:04.300> you<00:07:04.810> go<00:07:04.990> to<00:07:05.110> the<00:07:05.320> fifth<00:07:05.770> or

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
your slide and you go to the fifth or

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.010 
your slide and you go to the fifth or
the<00:07:06.040> seventh<00:07:06.550> you<00:07:07.210> won't<00:07:07.419> be<00:07:07.540> hitting<00:07:07.750> the

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
the seventh you won't be hitting the

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.590 
the seventh you won't be hitting the
correct<00:07:08.350> note<00:07:08.560> that<00:07:08.860> if<00:07:09.490> that<00:07:09.880> bridge<00:07:10.360> isn't

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
correct note that if that bridge isn't

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.230 
correct note that if that bridge isn't
in<00:07:10.840> the<00:07:10.960> right<00:07:11.110> position<00:07:11.820> so<00:07:12.820> we've<00:07:12.970> got<00:07:13.090> it

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
in the right position so we've got it

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.060 
in the right position so we've got it
set<00:07:13.419> up<00:07:13.450> there<00:07:14.520> the<00:07:15.520> next<00:07:15.880> lesson<00:07:16.360> will<00:07:16.780> be

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
set up there the next lesson will be

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.310 
set up there the next lesson will be
actually<00:07:18.070> tuning<00:07:18.640> it<00:07:18.910> in<00:07:19.630> this<00:07:19.840> case<00:07:20.140> I'm

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.320 
actually tuning it in this case I'm

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.610 
actually tuning it in this case I'm
going<00:07:20.440> to<00:07:20.530> tune<00:07:20.740> it<00:07:20.860> to<00:07:20.890> an<00:07:21.100> open<00:07:21.220> a
