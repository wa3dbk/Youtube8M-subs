00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
excited see what we can do and this ammo

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.520 
excited see what we can do and this ammo
is<00:02:54.160> running<00:02:54.940> about<00:02:55.260> 50<00:02:56.260> cents<00:02:56.560> around<00:02:56.860> now<00:02:57.100> so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
is running about 50 cents around now so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.259 
is running about 50 cents around now so
can't<00:02:59.530> do<00:02:59.680> too<00:02:59.890> much<00:03:00.310> playing<00:03:00.670> better<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:03.269> have

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.589 

another<00:03:11.709> reason<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.489> ammo<00:03:12.879> is<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.269> expensive

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
another reason this ammo is so expensive

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.720 
another reason this ammo is so expensive
is<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.530> survivalists<00:03:15.459> have<00:03:15.519> been

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
is that survivalists have been

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.270 
is that survivalists have been
purchasing<00:03:16.599> them<00:03:16.780> as<00:03:17.080> many<00:03:17.830> as<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.069> can<00:03:18.220> get

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
their hands on and lately so kind of

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.570 
their hands on and lately so kind of
drives<00:03:22.629> prices<00:03:23.110> up<00:03:23.260> when<00:03:23.580> manufacturers

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
drives prices up when manufacturers

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.350 
drives prices up when manufacturers
can't<00:03:24.879> keep<00:03:25.000> up<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.390> demand<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:27.360> we're
