00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.940

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.410

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.610
 New Year's Carnival 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.220
 so at the time of questions Ukrainian 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.650
 journalists are not all Anatoly Sobchak 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.289
 however very strange if you are my face and 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.659
 first would be nice positive emotions 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.949
 wide skirt because questions were 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.769

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.300
 serious things yes really well here 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.420
 either or those pages that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.819
 there were online photos with you 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.819
 we saw them how you react to it 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.679

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.139

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.960
 that could see people that way 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:01.760
 Well, I like at least strange to me 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.729
 I paid so much attention to that 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.600
 the moment when actually discussed 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.149
 important questions that were asked vadim 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.990
 alone on which he is exactly the same 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.000
 answered 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.390
 very seriously therefore talk about 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 what is attention pay attention not 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.729
 I think that this is correct svetlana let's 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.170
 discuss the results of the press conference 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.649
 serious it was several times you 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.030
 emphasized nevertheless it can 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.359
 differently also characterize 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.909
 the conversation was open honest tough and 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.350
 so on here you tell me what else 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.850
 left an impression on you 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:44.229
 press conferences which questions 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.880
 seemed the most interesting you know 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.499
 in general, the press conference left 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.820
 really very impression i 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.039

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.160
 not only the face of this word entered into 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.140
 turnover but vadim girl always 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.790
 since i work in his administration 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.150
 and serve the country itself 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:15.450
 I said something bad about him 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:17.730
 I really support him 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 let's talk what questions asked 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.900
 what questions seemed most important 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.430
 interesting interesting 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.070
 you know the most interesting question to me 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.550
 it seems the Ukrainian colleague seems to me 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.480
 made quite boldly able to ask 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.710
 quite acute question is not anatol 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.520
 not too distinguished 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.340
 as always harsh statements besides 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840
 of this but as you already discussed remember 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.880
 question park you because he was not 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.720
 the usual dropped out of the line seems to me 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.060
 most everyone was interested 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.170
 hear about the economic situation and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.630
 about the future prospects of its development 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.239
