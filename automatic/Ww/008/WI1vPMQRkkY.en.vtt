00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
if you were there in the 80s you would

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.909 
if you were there in the 80s you would
have<00:06:00.509> said<00:06:00.629> I<00:06:00.719> it<00:06:00.779> was<00:06:00.930> easier<00:06:01.169> in<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.319> 70s<00:06:01.800> if

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
have said I it was easier in the 70s if

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.800 
have said I it was easier in the 70s if
you<00:06:02.039> know<00:06:02.129> in<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.339> 60s<00:06:02.520> L<00:06:02.879> if<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.449> was<00:06:03.569> here<00:06:03.690> in

you know in the 60s L if I was here in

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.990 
you know in the 60s L if I was here in
the<00:06:03.900> 50s<00:06:04.379> it<00:06:05.279> would<00:06:05.400> have<00:06:05.490> been<00:06:05.610> easier<00:06:05.909> the

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
the 50s it would have been easier the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.850 
the 50s it would have been easier the
bottom<00:06:06.240> line<00:06:06.419> is<00:06:06.629> you<00:06:06.779> know<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.169> make<00:06:07.680> the

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.280 
know I should have been a priest or
something<00:07:10.890> because<00:07:11.670> what<00:07:12.180> I<00:07:12.210> was<00:07:12.540> taught<00:07:12.840> with

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
something because what I was taught with

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.290 
something because what I was taught with
the<00:07:13.410> nuns<00:07:13.650> money<00:07:14.190> is<00:07:14.460> evil

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
the nuns money is evil

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.090 
the nuns money is evil
yeah<00:07:15.720> I<00:07:15.750> can<00:07:16.020> remember<00:07:16.230> in<00:07:16.470> our<00:07:16.560> sister<00:07:16.920> Mary

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
Michael would say ah if you get rich

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.890 
Michael would say ah if you get rich
you're<00:07:20.100> never<00:07:20.280> gonna<00:07:20.400> get<00:07:20.610> into<00:07:20.850> heaven<00:07:21.060> but

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
you're never gonna get into heaven but

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.510 
you're never gonna get into heaven but
it<00:07:21.990> was<00:07:22.080> interesting<00:07:22.290> how<00:07:22.530> unsurprising<00:07:23.430> the

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
it was interesting how unsurprising the

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.340 
it was interesting how unsurprising the
nuns<00:07:23.730> were<00:07:23.970> they<00:07:24.180> were<00:07:24.240> always<00:07:24.630> making<00:07:25.020> money

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350 
nuns were they were always making money

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.630 
nuns were they were always making money
for<00:07:25.530> something<00:07:25.740> there<00:07:26.010> was<00:07:26.070> always<00:07:26.250> a<00:07:26.370> bring

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640 
for something there was always a bring

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.340 
for something there was always a bring
them<00:07:26.820> by<00:07:27.000> sale<00:07:27.360> or<00:07:27.570> a<00:07:27.600> cake<00:07:27.870> sale<00:07:28.110> or<00:07:28.320> something

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.350 
them by sale or a cake sale or something

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.220 
them by sale or a cake sale or something
so<00:07:29.280> you<00:07:29.880> know<00:07:29.910> I<00:07:30.210> think<00:07:30.450> I'd<00:07:30.690> learnt<00:07:30.930> quite<00:07:31.170> a

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 
so you know I think I'd learnt quite a

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.480
