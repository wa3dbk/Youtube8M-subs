00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.580
 the pulled up it is very cold from the sports editorial staff are welcome just today 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.540
 Stayed in touch with FC Utrecht all day how is it now that has not known what 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.729
 even a record that with a lot of verve 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.119
 maybe it was brought to the almelose hospital right after the accident and then 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.529
 industry the footsie 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 and there he was operated on a broken neck vertebra real how 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.880
 comes or came out of it when the operation has already been completed 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.939
 we do not know the big question that it is asking our name 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.839
 We are now also able to see if a cervical vertebra you might think so 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.309
 can never play football again after the extreme case know the answer I am afraid 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.160
 for years 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.510
 I had contact with the loudest again this afternoon and he told me and the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.640
 very simple story both if you have broken a cervical vertebra 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.700
 the others are involved with the nerves and the nerves that can 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.150
 three residents are bothered by the elbow and shoulder 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.910
 in the sense that I had been damaged 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.470
 the damage they do is stuck 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.840
 and that pressure being restored could see how you were free and then 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 in havelte time just the move and then you can recover it is in again 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.810
 damaged to you 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.060
 the balloon the king over agoria the other side but something like autumn the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.250
 was fully speculated on the internet this afternoon about a spinal cord injury 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.160
 wins worst case of fellow countrymen on the training field turned out to be his 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.180
 arms and legs could no longer move no but that can therefore also be up to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.970
 reflection is not necessarily because he is 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.810
 damaged is also the most recent ledger at utrecht which is for young people 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.040
 the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.600
 outside the field you do not want to be totally different from the ring in the field 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.200
 come 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 one of the polluting vehicles playing football picked up one of the ladies starting period 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.890
 requests from yellow cards 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.170
 and a while ago in the studio for names of numbers 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.030
 an entire timid almost shy 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.800
 he neatly with the boy opposite pole of the hill he is allowed to leave and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.900
 pvv yes and then comes the medium romania is not the netherlands that means the buses 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.530
 the players from outside these hours 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.159
 we have to earn more that is a rule 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.820
 I have higher basic salary spots until Mesu has properly saved budget 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:58.930
 of 40 prints 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.820
 and although his contract runs until next summer to grant ffff 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.790
 given jokes if you can find another club this summer 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.140
 we would like to cooperate on a transfer but yes so Muntunie the Netherlands 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.330
 has come from exactly but now he was happy to be led with all that action 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.519
 beautiful song was a nicer startled 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.970
 there are no more in my head and reactions in a foreign language too 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.099
 for the sport that tweeted that that runs full of all those people 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.760
 reacting shocked 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 the supporters of fc utrecht the criticism 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 who are shocked and who also announce that they are coming in fairly large numbers 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.630
 on Sunday during the last game it is so bad in this competition 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.409
 az we have to 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.569
 do something to send more and more yes we have to show our support 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.349
 the biggest small supporter of fc utrecht who has also tweeted and 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.419
 who even though I sympathize with you 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.979
 I can not believe that I am from Milan's Wesley Sneijder from A to 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.449
 demanded against him last year let's hope it's very can go better with 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.119
 the leaf half moon then by the week or three before we know 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.309
 how has that really been 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.319
 therefore doing the future out will get old for us to notice that 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.459
 he
