now<00:00:00.599> so<00:00:01.140> far<00:00:01.380> we've<00:00:01.589> dealt<00:00:01.829> only<00:00:02.010> with<00:00:02.159> games

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
now so far we've dealt only with games

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.309 
now so far we've dealt only with games
that<00:00:02.669> take<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.939> single<00:00:03.210> turn<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.080> there's

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
that take a single turn that is there's

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.140 
that take a single turn that is there's
two<00:00:04.470> players<00:00:04.740> they<00:00:05.069> both<00:00:05.250> simultaneously

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
two players they both simultaneously

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.270 
two players they both simultaneously
reveal<00:00:06.870> their<00:00:07.049> move<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.620> then<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> game<00:00:08.250> is

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
reveal their move and then the game is

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.730 
reveal their move and then the game is
over<00:00:08.570> but<00:00:09.570> game<00:00:09.719> theory<00:00:10.019> can<00:00:10.170> also<00:00:10.320> deal<00:00:10.679> with

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
over but game theory can also deal with

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.100 
over but game theory can also deal with
more<00:00:11.070> complex<00:00:11.460> games<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.330> multiple

game tree that we talked about in the
previous<00:00:50.070> unit<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.239> starts<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
previous unit so it starts out and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
there's a chance node so that this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.500 
there's a chance node so that this
corresponds<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.340> dealing<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> cards<00:00:57.000> with

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
corresponds to dealing the cards with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and the second player gets an ace one

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.310

third<00:01:02.370> first<00:01:03.270> player<00:01:03.510> gets<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.930> ace<00:01:04.080> and

third first player gets an ace and

third first player gets an ace and
second<00:01:04.710> player<00:01:04.890> gets<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.309> king<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.119> and

second player gets a king and so on and

confusion<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> second<00:01:54.600> player<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
confusion for the second player as to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.969 
confusion for the second player as to
what<00:01:55.259> state<00:01:55.500> they're<00:01:55.740> in

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
what state they're in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.209 
what state they're in
now<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.570> solve<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.990> game<00:01:58.259> using<00:01:59.100> this

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
now we can solve this game using this

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.889 
now we can solve this game using this
game<00:01:59.490> tree<00:01:59.759> approach<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.630> quite

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
game tree approach and it's not quite

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.980 
game tree approach and it's not quite
the<00:02:01.110> same<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.460> max<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.509> min<00:02:03.570> approach

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the same as the max and the min approach

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.479 
the same as the max and the min approach
because<00:02:04.979> where<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.890> States<00:02:08.160> what

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
because where you are in the States what

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.940 
because where you are in the States what
you<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.819> about<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.239> partial<00:02:09.629> information

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
you know about the partial information

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.800 
you know about the partial information
affects<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.160> strategy<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.300> way<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.690> we

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
affects your strategy in a way that we

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.230 
affects your strategy in a way that we
haven't

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
haven't

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.650 
haven't
with<00:02:13.510> before<00:02:13.920> now<00:02:14.920> one<00:02:15.520> possibility<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:16.540> how

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
with before now one possibility for how

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.140 
with before now one possibility for how
you<00:02:16.720> can<00:02:16.930> evaluate<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.770> game<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.670> is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
you can evaluate a game like this is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.990 
you can evaluate a game like this is
just<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.080> convert<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.220> other<00:02:21.370> form<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
just to convert it to the other form the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.430 
just to convert it to the other form the
form<00:02:22.180> we've<00:02:22.360> seen<00:02:22.540> before<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:23.080> called<00:02:23.320> the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
form we've seen before is called the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.650 
form we've seen before is called the
normal<00:02:23.800> form<00:02:24.070> or<00:02:24.280> matrix<00:02:24.670> form<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.630> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
normal form or matrix form this is the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.280 
normal form or matrix form this is the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
sequential gain in extensive form if we

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.320 
sequential gain in extensive form if we
convert<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> extensive<00:02:30.280> form<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:31.150> get

convert the extensive form we get

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
convert the extensive form we get
something<00:02:31.690> like<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.770> here<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.220> each

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
something like this and here for each

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.420 
something like this and here for each
player<00:02:33.640> we've<00:02:34.300> denoted<00:02:34.690> by<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.770> two<00:02:36.190> letter

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
strategy what you should do when you

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.380 
strategy what you should do when you
have<00:02:38.530> an<00:02:38.650> ace<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.160> what<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.880> should<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.180> when

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
have an ace and what you should do when

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.980 
have an ace and what you should do when
you<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.750> king<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.320> so<00:02:42.130> we<00:02:43.000> end<00:02:43.150> up<00:02:43.300> with<00:02:43.540> an

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
you have a king and so we end up with an

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.380 
you have a king and so we end up with an
exponentially<00:02:44.710> large<00:02:44.740> search<00:02:45.310> space<00:02:45.640> but

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
exponentially large search space but

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.690 
exponentially large search space but
here<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.140> game<00:02:47.350> was<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.650> simple<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.430> ends

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
here the game was so simple that it ends

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.760 
here the game was so simple that it ends
up<00:02:48.760> being<00:02:49.000> rather<00:02:49.240> small<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.440> game<00:02:50.620> is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
up being rather small and the game is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.710 
up being rather small and the game is
rather<00:02:50.890> trivial<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> solve<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
rather trivial and you can solve it and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.650 
rather trivial and you can solve it and
it<00:02:53.620> turns<00:02:53.830> out<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.280> there<00:02:54.460> are<00:02:54.490> two

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
it turns out that there are two

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.050 
it turns out that there are two
equilibrium<00:02:55.890> corresponding<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
equilibrium corresponding to the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.720 
equilibrium corresponding to the
strategy<00:02:58.570> for<00:02:58.780> player<00:02:59.020> two<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.650> he<00:03:00.490> should

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
strategy for player two is he should

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.760 
strategy for player two is he should
check<00:03:00.970> when<00:03:01.150> he<00:03:01.240> has<00:03:01.420> an<00:03:01.600> ace<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.080> he<00:03:02.560> should

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
check when he has an ace and he should

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.150 
check when he has an ace and he should
fold<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.550> he<00:03:03.670> has<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:03.850> king<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:04.980> strategy<00:03:05.980> for

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
fold and he has a king and strategy for

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.090 
fold and he has a king and strategy for
player<00:03:06.370> one<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.900> doesn't<00:03:08.110> matter<00:03:08.380> if<00:03:08.800> he

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
player one is it doesn't matter if he

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.510 
player one is it doesn't matter if he
raises<00:03:10.060> or<00:03:10.300> checks<00:03:10.930> when<00:03:11.230> he<00:03:11.350> has<00:03:11.500> an<00:03:11.680> ace<00:03:11.860> but

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
raises or checks when he has an ace but

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.950 
raises or checks when he has an ace but
he<00:03:12.610> should<00:03:12.760> check<00:03:12.970> when<00:03:13.120> he<00:03:13.210> has<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> king<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
he should check when he has a king and

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.140 
he should check when he has a king and
that<00:03:14.320> would<00:03:14.470> give<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.740> game<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.190> value<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.850> zero

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
that would give the game a value of zero

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.870 
that would give the game a value of zero
now<00:03:16.710> this<00:03:17.710> works<00:03:17.920> fine<00:03:18.160> for<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.580> simple

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
now this works fine for the simple

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.530 
now this works fine for the simple
version<00:03:19.300> of<00:03:19.660> poker<00:03:19.900> for<00:03:20.650> real<00:03:20.860> poker<00:03:21.540> this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
version of poker for real poker this

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.720 
version of poker for real poker this
table<00:03:23.020> would<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.290> about<00:03:23.740> 10<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> 18th

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
table would have about 10 to the 18th

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.970 
table would have about 10 to the 18th
states<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.020> would<00:03:26.140> be<00:03:26.260> impossible<00:03:26.530> to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
states and it would be impossible to

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.130 
states and it would be impossible to
deal<00:03:27.160> with<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.210> we<00:03:28.330> need<00:03:28.480> some<00:03:28.660> strategies

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
deal with and so we need some strategies

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.480 
deal with and so we need some strategies
for<00:03:29.410> getting<00:03:29.500> back<00:03:29.800> down<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.310> reasonable

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
for getting back down to a reasonable

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.390 
for getting back down to a reasonable
number<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:31.060> states
