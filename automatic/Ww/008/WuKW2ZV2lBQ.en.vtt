that's what attracted me in the first

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.959 
that's what attracted me in the first
place<00:00:49.050> many<00:00:49.559> primary<00:00:49.920> schools<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.550> no<00:00:50.789> men

said a male teacher had been an
important<00:01:02.160> role<00:01:02.399> model<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.090> male

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
important role model you need male

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.380

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
basically they give a different

basically they give a different
perspective<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> children<00:01:09.840> need

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.890 
perspective I think the children need
both<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.799> balance<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.820> women<00:01:12.420> teachers<00:01:12.630> through

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
both a balance of women teachers through

I suppose the the advantage of going

into teaching is that there is relative

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.460
