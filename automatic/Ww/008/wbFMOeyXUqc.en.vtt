00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.870
 good to all dear spectators who witness this video I am your friend I follow 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.590
 how everyone is doing 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.940
 I wait 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.380
 today's topic will be another stupid top-5 of my opinion the best rpgs 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.960
 if you know anything of this kind 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.920
 they will know that the most important of these games is the history and a gameplay 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.690
 that dares to be different to vary from the typical standard of the RPGs 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.080
 shifts but let's go to the topic before rambling more 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.600
 number 5 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.630
 of world ends' with iu for the nintendo ds 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.580
 what to say about this great game 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.470
 one of the most innovative rpgs not only for the ps but in general a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 battle system that takes full advantage of the capabilities of the ps 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 an unusual aesthetic for the characters although very artistic and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 story and the characters 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.759
 maybe god of the best of the game since it is not the typical RPG game set in 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.610
 the average age 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.070
 but located in a contemporary era 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 and it's one of the games of its kind with characters more psychologically is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.850
 developed 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.800
 that makes you undoubtedly love you with some 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.730
 either with him in a frantic one of the cu the adorable though unsure of himself that 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.280
 the nice prime the rough of vic 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.500
 or the fool of joshua 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.360
 it is inevitable 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.479
 the only thing that would criticize the game 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.350
 is that the SME system is silly in this one would be complicated mind 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.940
 and if you have never played a rpg before 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.860
 maybe you suffer trying to discover how to use the system correctly 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.620
 Number 4 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.070
 For this position 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.409
 I wanted to put one of the final fantasy saga but I could not decide for one 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.439
 although to the end 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.329
 lecturing and putting all the factors together 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.840
 I've decided on the final fantasy 4 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 for the esn it is ps 1 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.909
 bimbo and advance and ds 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.249
 this game not only reinvented the saga 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.279
 since he used the most durable battle system in the saga 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.519
 He also had a really elaborate story 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.469
 a black gentleman called cecil 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.139
 raised and trained by the king the barony with his best friend cain 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.319
 he runs a company called the red wings of Wallonia 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.999
 an elite force of the kingdom 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.230
 lately the king ordered to attend to recover the crystals by force 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.329
 Although Cecil will deeply regret his actions 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.239
 it is finally 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.019
 when Cecil and his friend Cain destroy a village on the orders of their king 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.419
 that is to say he realizes his atrocities and rebels against the 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:55.940
 empire 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.519
 the unite to valuable companions that you will find in the trip 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.959
 will try to find a way to stop the barony empire from continuing 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.490
 with his crimes and at the same time 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.060
 will try to redeem himself from all his crimes by working for the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.799
 bologna's empire 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.189
 sincerely before game I can not highlight any defect 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.189
 since this game is fine to be a final fantasy although they could work 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.599
 more the battle system despite being fine for what it is 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.029
 number 3 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.839
 luminous fed up for the nintendo ds 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.449
 this might look like the typical RPG strategy game like any other 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.969
 but it goes beyond that 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.219
 since it has a number of playable characters excellent but perhaps the greatest 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.569
 attractiveness of the game is its very elaborate and extensive history that not only 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.170
 leads to a world where there is discrepancy between witches and humans 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.480
 you also have a certain level of interactivity with the characters 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.680
 making each character have their own story 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.170
 that there are in stories for each character apart from the story 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.870
 principal 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.540
 not to mention that this game fixes many box of the previous game 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.469
 also at the same time making it more balanced 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.180
 what I think could have improved a lot 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.559
 is to add more things to the battle system 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:10.449
 that as well as this I think it's fine but could have highlighted more than 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.929
 the other strategy games of its kind 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.319
 number 2 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.209
 beat kaitos for the nintendo gamecube 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.030
 this rpg breaks all scheme for the genre 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.699
 seriously 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.789
 this rpg dared to be different in every way and triumph 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.509
 good where to start 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.830
 maybe that the battle system is pretty good and original 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.229
 since it involves improvisation intelligence skill 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.090
 agility and some luck 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.289
 the system of levels 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.270
 you do not level up in a conventional way since it's a matter of earning points 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.929
 battle to redeem and level up depending on your points 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.500
 trade 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 because you do not earn money in battles 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.229
 If you do not take pictures in battles to sell them 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.180
 that next to sell the cards that you no longer use 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.460
 and history 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.940
 well the point is that the main story goes to the background 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.770
 since you are not the protagonist 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.000
 since they put them in different margins 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.610
 since you speak and interact with it to distinctly control it 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.380
 and the game focuses more on the personal stories of the characters and 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.699
 your hidden motives 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.800
 that overlapping the main story 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.590
 complete a plot that despite not being the best 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.270
 if it fulfills its purpose 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.139
 the only thing that criticized the game 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.949
 is that it does not have a tutorial 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.090
 and for the battle system that he has, he could perfectly have one 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.009
 since within the battle system 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.550
 there are many useful tips 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.490
 which are very useful in certain battles of the game 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.360
 number one 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.349
 for this position I did have problems deciding 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.439
 since both the such of the abyss and the such of simony are real games 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.249
 magnificent ones that deserve the first place but speaking which of the two is 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.810
 better putting all their qualities together 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.770
 I think that the first prize deserves him such of symphonia for nintendo 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.449
 gamecube and playstation 2 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.189
 Well what else to say about this magnificent game 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.099
 excellent graphics for a game of its kind 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.160
 a different but typical battle system of the saga 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.620
 and very apt for what it is 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.599
 a rather extensive and very compelling story that has it all 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:13.050
 and without forgetting characters with charisma that makes it impossible for you not to get attached to 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.449
 some of them 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.389
 Well the point is that one of the biggest attractions of the game is its system of 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.400
 battle other than usual 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.580
 since it is not the typical system of battles in turns but rather in a 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.090
 system called lmds which by its acronym in English is linear motion batirle 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.729
 system 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.310
 that gives you direct control and in real time of a character 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.620
 being the other members of the party controlled by intelligence 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.100
 artificial game by doing something similar the game to a fighting game in 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.620
 two 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.300
 of street fighter style 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.189
 but of course while being trp g 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.580
 well this has been all for now I hope you liked it 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.020
 and if you do not agree with the count I remind you that it is only my opinion 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.110
 personal 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.860
 and that they are free to do their own counting either in a comment or in a 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.900
 video response and so give other points of view of the subject 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.479
 by I'm going for now 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.249
 see you 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.299
 do well and remember be happy and good
