00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
when the starter is working if it sounds

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
when the starter is working if it sounds
normal<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.989> cranking<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> engine<00:00:49.649> at

normal if it's cranking the engine at
the<00:00:50.100> normal<00:00:50.640> speed<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:50.940> chances<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the normal speed then chances are it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
the normal speed then chances are it's
only<00:00:52.620> dirty<00:00:53.129> contacts<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.300> why

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
only dirty contacts and that's why

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110 
only dirty contacts and that's why
you're<00:00:54.719> repeatedly<00:00:55.260> turning<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> key<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.850> try

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you're repeatedly turning the key to try

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.880 
you're repeatedly turning the key to try
and<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.170> connection<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and get it to make that connection in

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.209 
and get it to make that connection in
this<00:00:59.520> video<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.420> show<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.719> how<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> clean

this video I will show you how to clean

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.170 
this video I will show you how to clean
these<00:01:02.579> contacts<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.539> case<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.180> necessary

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
these contacts in case of a necessary

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
these contacts in case of a necessary
emergency<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.350> best<00:01:07.560> always<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.130> change

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
emergency but it's best always to change

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.080 
emergency but it's best always to change
them<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.100> some<00:01:11.159> basic<00:01:11.520> metric

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
them and you will need some basic metric

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
them and you will need some basic metric
tools<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.470> can't<00:01:13.770> take<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> starter<00:01:14.700> out

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
tools if you can't take a starter out

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.520 
tools if you can't take a starter out
and<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> workbench<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and work on it on the workbench and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.859 
and work on it on the workbench and
probably<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.460> shouldn't<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:18.000> doing<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.509> but

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
probably you shouldn't be doing this but

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.749 
probably you shouldn't be doing this but
the<00:01:19.020> first<00:01:19.259> thing<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.280> take<00:01:20.490> off

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the first thing you do is you take off

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.020 
the first thing you do is you take off
the<00:01:21.360> connection<00:01:22.080> nut<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.430> power<00:01:23.640> side

the connection nut on the power side

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
the connection nut on the power side
where<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.350> electrical<00:01:25.830> power<00:01:25.979> goes<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
where the electrical power goes from the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
where the electrical power goes from the
scylla<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> motor<00:01:28.320> itself

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
scylla know down into the motor itself

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.920 
scylla know down into the motor itself
and<00:01:29.130> you'll<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> rubber

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
with your finger to keep it flat there

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.850 
with your finger to keep it flat there
it's<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.640> simple<00:05:53.000> then<00:05:53.720> we<00:05:53.870> we<00:05:54.320> reassemble

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
it's that simple then we we reassemble

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.610 
it's that simple then we we reassemble
the<00:05:55.100> other<00:05:55.310> side<00:05:55.669> again<00:05:56.600> remembering<00:05:57.229> the<00:05:57.470> way

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
the other side again remembering the way

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.600 
the other side again remembering the way
our<00:05:57.950> components<00:05:58.610> went<00:05:58.789> together<00:05:59.180> and<00:06:00.430> we<00:06:01.430> have

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
our components went together and we have

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.940 
our components went together and we have
the<00:06:01.850> plastic<00:06:02.150> insulation<00:06:02.960> sleeve<00:06:03.440> which<00:06:03.770> is

the plastic insulation sleeve which is

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.500 
the plastic insulation sleeve which is
going<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.280> go<00:06:04.430> in<00:06:04.610> there<00:06:04.789> that<00:06:04.970> keeps<00:06:05.270> these

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
going to go in there that keeps these

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.659 
going to go in there that keeps these
pieces<00:06:06.140> from<00:06:06.320> coming<00:06:06.680> in<00:06:06.800> contact<00:06:06.830> with<00:06:07.400> the

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669

metal housing of the starter itself
that's<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:11.120> only<00:06:11.419> way<00:06:11.539> these<00:06:12.080> parts<00:06:12.470> don't

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
that's the only way these parts don't

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.040 
that's the only way these parts don't
short<00:06:13.010> out<00:06:13.190> so<00:06:13.520> it's<00:06:13.669> important<00:06:14.330> that<00:06:14.630> this<00:06:14.840> be

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
short out so it's important that this be

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.320 
short out so it's important that this be
assembled<00:06:15.530> carefully<00:06:16.160> and<00:06:16.340> again<00:06:17.060> we're

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
assembled carefully and again we're

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.000 
assembled carefully and again we're
going<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:17.600> make<00:06:17.780> sure<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.020> that<00:06:18.530> copper
