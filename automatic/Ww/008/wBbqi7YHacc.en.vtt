let's<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.450> first<00:02:06.979> sports<00:02:07.979> suit<00:02:08.220> by<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:09.239> for

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
let's just first sports suit by up for

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.540 
let's just first sports suit by up for
off<00:02:10.020> bought<00:02:10.259> attention<00:02:10.649> iphone

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
off bought attention iphone

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.550 
off bought attention iphone
to<00:02:12.060> sink<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> case<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.990> could<00:02:13.140> sink<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.440> in

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to sink in the case you could sink it in

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.060 
to sink in the case you could sink it in
the<00:02:13.650> case<00:02:14.240> which<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.390> always<00:02:15.540> good<00:02:15.950> looks<00:02:16.950> like

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
the case which is always good looks like

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.810 
the case which is always good looks like
they<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.220> volume<00:02:17.610> rockers<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.300> home<00:02:18.570> slot

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
they have volume rockers and a home slot

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.970 
they have volume rockers and a home slot
let's<00:02:20.820> see<00:02:20.970> what<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.500> incorrect<00:02:22.500> correct

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
let's see what this is incorrect correct

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.050 
let's see what this is incorrect correct
it<00:02:23.160> shows<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.580> gives<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> whole<00:02:24.000> bunch

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it shows it just gives you a whole bunch

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
it shows it just gives you a whole bunch
of<00:02:24.270> different<00:02:24.540> things<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.130> here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
of different things and this right here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.750 
of different things and this right here
I'm<00:02:26.820> not<00:02:27.210> really<00:02:27.390> sure<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.520> no<00:02:31.280> I'll<00:02:32.280> find

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I'm not really sure this is no I'll find

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
I'm not really sure this is no I'll find
out<00:02:32.910> later<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.210> guess<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:34.200> I'm<00:02:34.320> here's<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
out later I guess but I'm here's the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.980 
out later I guess but I'm here's the
case<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.760> see<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.030> has<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> nice<00:02:36.420> belt<00:02:36.780> clip

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
case and you see it has a nice belt clip

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.950 
case and you see it has a nice belt clip
on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> back<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:38.130> undo<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.480> it's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
on the back just undo it like that it's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.040 
on the back just undo it like that it's
actually<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.350> soft<00:02:40.650> case<00:02:41.390> as<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.810> says

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
actually a really soft case as it says

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.290 
actually a really soft case as it says
let<00:02:43.590> me<00:02:43.680> go<00:02:44.130> ahead<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.490> guess<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:44.940> how<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.120> do

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300

it right here yeah look at that just

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.660 
it right here yeah look at that just
undoes<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.020> what<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.920> dummy

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
undoes it like that what the dummy

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.880 
undoes it like that what the dummy
iphone<00:02:51.150> ipod<00:02:52.050> touch<00:02:52.080> whatever<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.710> want<00:02:52.830> to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.770 
call it ipod touch opposite sense for
the<00:02:56.580> 2g<00:02:56.820> right<00:02:57.150> here<00:02:57.330> I'll<00:02:57.810> stick<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.080> out

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the 2g right here I'll stick it out

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.300 
the 2g right here I'll stick it out
there<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> go<00:03:00.990> no<00:03:01.200> snow<00:03:01.650> screen<00:03:01.920> protectors

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
somewhat small right now me it's going

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.070 
somewhat small right now me it's going
to<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.190> tight<00:03:11.460> fit<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:11.940> let's<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:12.960> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
to have a tight fit on it let's go and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.600 
to have a tight fit on it let's go and
put<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.560> let<00:03:13.710> me<00:03:13.740> take<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.430> this

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
put that in let me take it on in this

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.300 
put that in let me take it on in this
case<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:16.820> voltage<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.480> G<00:03:19.160> All<00:03:20.160> Right

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
case right here voltage to G All Right

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.640 
case right here voltage to G All Right
see<00:03:22.489> very<00:03:23.489> good<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.020> let's<00:03:25.170> put<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.470> it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
see very good and so let's put it in it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.199 
see very good and so let's put it in it
looks<00:03:25.800> like<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> put<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.340> upside<00:03:26.489> down<00:03:26.970> so

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
looks like you put it in upside down so

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.520 
looks like you put it in upside down so
you're<00:03:27.330> gonna<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:30.380> take<00:03:31.380> me<00:03:31.500> a

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
you're gonna do it like this I take me a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.880 
you're gonna do it like this I take me a
little<00:03:31.680> time<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:31.950> figure<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:33.620> there<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.739> go

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
little time to figure this there you go

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.910 
little time to figure this there you go
it's<00:03:35.160> gonna<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> tight<00:03:35.640> fit<00:03:38.390> let's<00:03:39.390> try<00:03:39.600> to

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
it's gonna be a tight fit let's try to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.080 
it's gonna be a tight fit let's try to
slide<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.459> oh<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:46.730> don't<00:03:47.730> know<00:03:47.880> what<00:03:48.030> I

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
slide it on in oh I don't know what I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:56.000 
slide it on in oh I don't know what I
was<00:03:48.209> just<00:03:48.390> thinking<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.850> let's<00:03:51.300> go<00:03:51.570> ahead<00:03:51.600> and

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.880 

there<00:03:56.730> we<00:03:56.849> go<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.230> said<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.680> really

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
there we go like I said it's a really

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.940 
there we go like I said it's a really
tight<00:03:59.129> fit<00:03:59.489> on<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:01.200> put<00:04:01.379> this<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.709> there<00:04:01.829> as

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
tight fit on it you put this in there as

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.850 
tight fit on it you put this in there as
well<00:04:02.599> get<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.780> I'm<00:04:03.930> doing<00:04:06.349> try<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.409> shut<00:04:07.709> this

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
well get to I'm doing try to shut this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.830 
well get to I'm doing try to shut this
in<00:04:08.069> there<00:04:08.250> right<00:04:08.400> now<00:04:08.579> I'm<00:04:09.209> not<00:04:09.299> sure<00:04:09.540> he<00:04:09.689> do<00:04:09.810> I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
in there right now I'm not sure he do I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.860 
in there right now I'm not sure he do I
think<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.230> put<00:04:11.069> it<00:04:11.129> inside<00:04:14.480> all<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.690> and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
think you put it inside all right and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.310 
think you put it inside all right and
then<00:04:15.959> there<00:04:16.229> you<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.949> have<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.370> ipod<00:04:18.320> this

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
then there you go you have the ipod this

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.689 
then there you go you have the ipod this
actually<00:04:19.650> looks<00:04:19.769> like<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.010> very<00:04:20.190> nice<00:04:20.400> case

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
actually looks like a very nice case

that<00:06:13.160> oh<00:06:16.960> if<00:06:17.960> you<00:06:18.080> really<00:06:18.470> want<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:18.650> see<00:06:18.860> me

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
that oh if you really want to see me

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.980 
that oh if you really want to see me
doing<00:06:19.220> this<00:06:19.460> but<00:06:20.140> anyways<00:06:21.140> let's<00:06:21.590> just<00:06:21.800> try

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
doing this but anyways let's just try

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.090 
doing this but anyways let's just try
this<00:06:23.990> looks<00:06:24.200> like<00:06:24.290> it's<00:06:24.470> going<00:06:24.560> to<00:06:24.620> stick<00:06:24.950> to

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
this looks like it's going to stick to

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.260 
this looks like it's going to stick to
the<00:06:25.130> back<00:06:25.400> right<00:06:25.610> here<00:06:27.880> but<00:06:28.880> you<00:06:28.970> could<00:06:29.150> just

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
the back right here but you could just

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.940 
the back right here but you could just
well<00:06:29.960> I'm<00:06:30.110> not<00:06:30.230> gonna<00:06:30.350> I'm<00:06:30.560> not<00:06:30.590> gonna<00:06:30.740> give<00:06:30.890> a

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
well I'm not gonna I'm not gonna give a

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.770 
well I'm not gonna I'm not gonna give a
demonstration<00:06:31.100> but<00:06:31.700> you<00:06:32.180> could<00:06:32.330> just<00:06:32.420> do<00:06:32.600> that

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
demonstration but you could just do that

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.200 
demonstration but you could just do that
and<00:06:33.080> this<00:06:33.710> thing<00:06:33.980> clips<00:06:34.280> in<00:06:34.430> there<00:06:34.640> like<00:06:35.000> this

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
and this thing clips in there like this

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.780 
and this thing clips in there like this
I'm<00:06:35.450> guessing<00:06:35.650> just<00:06:36.650> slide<00:06:36.920> this<00:06:37.220> into<00:06:37.550> there

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
I'm guessing just slide this into there

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.130 
I'm guessing just slide this into there
with<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.330> belt<00:06:38.540> clip<00:06:38.780> on<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.080> back<00:06:40.480> and<00:06:41.480> it
