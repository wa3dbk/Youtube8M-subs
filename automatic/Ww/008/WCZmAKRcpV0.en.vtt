with<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> angle<00:01:51.610> grinder<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:54.430> I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
with the angle grinder and then I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.050 
with the angle grinder and then I
finally<00:01:54.850> cut<00:01:55.480> out<00:01:55.600> some<00:01:55.840> plywood<00:01:56.320> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
finally cut out some plywood and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.970 
finally cut out some plywood and
two-part<00:01:58.060> epoxy<00:01:58.180> duct<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.840> handle<00:01:59.350> and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
two-part epoxy duct to the handle and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.610 
two-part epoxy duct to the handle and
then<00:02:00.610> simply<00:02:01.090> rounded<00:02:01.870> it<00:02:02.020> down<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.470> wrap

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
then simply rounded it down and wrap

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.350 
then simply rounded it down and wrap
some<00:02:02.650> tape<00:02:03.010> around<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.580> give<00:02:03.730> it<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.880> nice<00:02:04.030> color

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
some tape around to give it a nice color

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.890 
some tape around to give it a nice color
