00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
of variety at all and it was just a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
of variety at all and it was just a
little<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:44.940> bland<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> what

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
little bit bland and it was kind of what

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.950
