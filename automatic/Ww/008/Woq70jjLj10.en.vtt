00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
brilliantly

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.020 
brilliantly
so<00:00:33.210> simply<00:00:33.719> unscrew<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:35.190> comes<00:00:35.489> apart<00:00:35.790> into

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so simply unscrew it it comes apart into

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
so simply unscrew it it comes apart into
three<00:00:36.120> pieces<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.040> there's<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> mark<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
three pieces and there's a mark here and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
three pieces and there's a mark here and
that<00:00:39.030> tells<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.450> where<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.780> put<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> water<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that tells you where to put the water to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.150 
that tells you where to put the water to
so<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.309> cold<00:00:41.550> water<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.559> mock<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.920> size

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
so it's cold water a mock of this size

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.660 
so it's cold water a mock of this size
will<00:00:44.460> make<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:45.239> four<00:00:45.719> espressos<00:00:46.579> then<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have your funnel that goes in and then

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.830

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
milk so screw this on as tightly as you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
milk so screw this on as tightly as you
can<00:01:10.380> otherwise<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.820> water<00:01:12.030> will<00:01:12.270> leak<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
can otherwise the water will leak to the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710 
can otherwise the water will leak to the
sides<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.890> put<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> lowest<00:01:15.360> ring

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
sides and then put it on the lowest ring

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.459 
sides and then put it on the lowest ring
that<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> heard

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.739 

that's<00:01:22.469> ready<00:01:22.859> so<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> usually<00:01:23.999> work<00:01:24.329> on<00:01:24.479> about

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
that's ready so I usually work on about

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.410 
that's ready so I usually work on about
an<00:01:24.899> espresso<00:01:25.259> cup<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.920> coffee<00:01:26.280> any<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.270> than

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
little bit more there we are and then

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080 
little bit more there we are and then
you<00:01:48.119> simply<00:01:48.740> drown<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:50.310> ice<00:01:50.549> cream<00:01:50.880> in

and if you wanted something a little bit
stronger<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.590> could<00:01:59.770> use<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> coffee<00:02:00.189> liqueur

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430
