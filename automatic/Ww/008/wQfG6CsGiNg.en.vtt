00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.630
 so always the same I'm going I'm going 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.490
 in my menu 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.800
 instead of giving me my points I'm going 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.830
 simply on the way okay I 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.210
 find almost the same thing as this 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.550
 that I had on wii points so 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.560
 the use is almost identical 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 the difference between waypoints the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.130
 roads is that the flock point I 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.940
 will go from point to point and I'm going 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.710
 having to do the handling at each to 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.989
 every point at every cap 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 gold the road the points will be chained 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.499
 the ones with the others 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.120
 so I always go by m interested 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.760
 initially at the helm of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.449
 creation I choose it I go 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.460
 in my card 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.199
 actually I have a toolbar 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.929
 like the bardot and points that appears 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.980
 agree with features a 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.969
 very little bit different 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.550
 functionality and principal and being 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.710
 actually this first button that me 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.040
 allows you to add waypoints to the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.860
 route its marks and at the bottom of the screen 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.290
 to help us and just every 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.969
 once I click it will be able to create me 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.090
 actually points yes and they are going 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.430
 be linked to each other by a 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.320
 trait what is called a road and we 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.570
 will be able to pass and chain the bridge 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.979
 points of agreement what is very 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.750
 interesting in there is that I 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.789
 pose create a route through the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.469
 paths and across the trails but 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.000
 I can also add for example if I 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.090
 want to add to the road I come 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.850
 to perform here my point 4 which is there 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.950
 I stay click on the point and I tell him 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.810
 request to add it to the road is my 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.380
 point who were isolated becomes a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.329
 point of the road always like the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.439
 points flaws if I want to back up 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:55.090
 my route I have my record to the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.090
 keyboard here so i'm going to call it test 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 1 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.640
 closes my hockey keyboard and I can even 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:11.959
 cleared the map route 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 here and if I want to come back to recover 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.069
 either I go in my yellow folder either 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.450
 I go to my menu routes 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 loaded 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.849
 I select my route ok and when I 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.680
 come back in the broken cardes of 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.569
 redisplay now if I want 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.720
 navigate this route I just need 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:38.739
 to go in road random road menu and 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.540
 there he will be able to give me actually 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:46.209
 my cape directly to go to my 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.650
 first point i will make them go to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.209
 map 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.239
 actually he will pick me up the point 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.620
 the closest to the road compared to 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.780
 my current position 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.090
 when I'm going to get to that point 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.079
 chronologically he will go get me this 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:12.019
 Point there and so on 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:14.480
 if I need to pass a webphone or 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.150
 several wiipoints and well enough 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 to go to the following points on 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.690
 responds following the previous shoulders 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:28.069
 here if I also want to navigate in the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.780
 opposite meaning that my 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.099
 last point of the road becomes my 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.200
 first point is my first point 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.359
 becomes my last point it is enough for me 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.359
 to reverse 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.579
 and there when I go back on my map 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.380
 actually I had done twice 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.720
 next and when I'm doing a verse but 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.340
 it comes back to me from the start and there when 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.169
 I'll get to this point there he goes 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.410
 from that side rather from this 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.410
 side 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.450
 information route it's the properties 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.350
 of the road is to be able to go 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.680
 visualize the information of each point 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.350
 that make up the road but also 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.080
 why not change it 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.120
 change change latitude position 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.120
 longitude my point moves
