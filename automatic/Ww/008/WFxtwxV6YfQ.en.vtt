 number 5 his dress style that does not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 ceases to evolve and wish

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.500
 number 6 segou male the number 7 sa 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 signing his hat nose for 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.979
 succeed one of the cats as well as the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.810
 blown a few regattas follows 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.470
 firstly you need a tracer 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.030
 liquid preferably in fact m it takes 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.009
 absolutely they are black without 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.750
 apply it and after the eye shadow 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.780
 never take you away but before 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.290
 mascara so my thing super easy to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.920
 to follow 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.159
 we point the tip outward from 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.960
 the eye 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.549
 and then instead of doing the kind line 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.740
 like a pro in one movement 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.740
 we are even taken to the consensus 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.830
 about twice for this our backgrounds 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.410
 of the eye 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.150
 Then we turn the edge to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.660
 point to the inside of the eye and we 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.920
 do the same thing for the time once 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.360
 that it's over once our two 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.940
 halves joined in the middle one 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.810
 come to the point for this super 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.980
 easy look look less agree 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.720
 then if you do the same to you 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.410
 term and not your eyes you stay right 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.360
 in front of a mirror 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.910
 they just did imagine that our 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.060
 line of lower continuous ones 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.880
 larry in the isere and we print like 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.130
 this group like that we see where to draw 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.750
 our line just join the tip 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.160
 should do with the line we 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.160
 had done a real ably 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.769
 but as long as I'm going to do it myself 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.750
 stuff if I'm in front of my mirror 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.160
 yes I destroyed because meters of 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 liquid route it peeves a little stressful 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.810
 but the thing is really project 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.640
 our mirror side by side 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.360
 our shot on the head for not shaking 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.830
 and instead of trying to how farm 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.170
 not the eyes one raises the chin like 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.829
 we see what we do above all 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.250
 it's great I recap it just 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.290
 and award-winning 1.1 by pointing the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.400
 the outside of the eye at the root of the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.620
 ciron the bonuses 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.660
 until the middle we will turn on board 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.170
 did the same thing to go 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.989
 to join malines agrees to do and 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.329
 then for the tip 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.299
 we imagine that we his references 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.930
 continent top we print like that and 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.110
 need 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.370
 with what was already possible 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.709
 come to one 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.530
 I already had mascaras and not to 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.670
 to see mascara if you 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.650
 try it home really wants to see 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.190
 what does that give a hashtag from the sector of 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.190
 barrel 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.790
 I'm cheating with a cat on it but 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.370
 it's you I did not drink 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.699
 had nothing to do not what you tell me 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.699
