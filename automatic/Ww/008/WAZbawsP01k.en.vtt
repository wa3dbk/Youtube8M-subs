starting us off with a liner this is
gonna<00:00:14.549> be<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:14.849> time<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.240> see<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> new

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
arc liner that's gonna be a 3d print

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.910 
arc liner that's gonna be a 3d print
that<00:00:18.210> helps<00:00:18.449> wick<00:00:18.690> away<00:00:18.840> moisture<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
that helps wick away moisture and it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.800 
that helps wick away moisture and it
also<00:00:20.070> does<00:00:20.430> give<00:00:20.580> air<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> nice<00:00:21.119> passageway<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
also does give air a nice passageway to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750 
also does give air a nice passageway to
come<00:00:22.109> through<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.529> help<00:00:22.920> keep<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.310> cool<00:00:23.490> now

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
come through and help keep it cool now

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.700 
come through and help keep it cool now
for<00:00:24.269> some<00:00:24.390> good<00:00:24.420> mobility<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.260> added<00:00:25.590> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
for some good mobility they added on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
for some good mobility they added on
some<00:00:25.949> stretch<00:00:26.310> panels<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.970> both<00:00:27.570> sides<00:00:27.900> here

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
some stretch panels on both sides here

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
some stretch panels on both sides here
so<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.650> allows<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> padding<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> really

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
so it's allows the padding to really

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.700 
so it's allows the padding to really
move<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.750> give<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.349> great

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
move with you and give you some great
mobility<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:33.000> far<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.210> protection<00:00:33.690> goes

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
mobility and as far as protection goes

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
mobility and as far as protection goes
on<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> kidneys<00:00:34.680> there's<00:00:35.160> some<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.670> thick

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
mobility we've got the padded or we got

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.780 
mobility we've got the padded or we got
the<00:03:10.230> suspenders<00:03:10.830> loops<00:03:11.070> here<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.520> rear

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the suspenders loops here in the rear

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.790 
the suspenders loops here in the rear
and<00:03:12.420> we've<00:03:12.540> got<00:03:12.690> some<00:03:12.900> more<00:03:13.020> stretch<00:03:13.500> zone<00:03:13.530> x'

two panels as well as the crotch gusset
that<00:03:17.970> moves<00:03:18.270> around<00:03:18.420> from<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.870> front<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.740> give

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
that moves around from the front so give

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.910 
that moves around from the front so give
me<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.250> good<00:03:20.580> mobility<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.470> you're<00:03:22.650> getting

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920

me that good mobility and you're getting
a<00:03:23.070> little<00:03:23.370> more<00:03:23.550> padding<00:03:24.000> than<00:03:24.240> what<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.630> saw

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
a little more padding than what we saw

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.810 
a little more padding than what we saw
in<00:03:24.960> that<00:03:24.990> 80<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.950> again<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.430> see<00:03:26.580> we<00:03:26.700> have

in that 80 so again you can see we have

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.550 
in that 80 so again you can see we have
a<00:03:26.850> nice<00:03:27.030> thick<00:03:27.270> foam<00:03:27.510> medium<00:03:27.930> density<00:03:28.230> pad

a nice thick foam medium density pad

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.860 
a nice thick foam medium density pad
here<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.060> then<00:03:30.180> as<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.660> down<00:03:30.810> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
here and here and then as we get down a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.780 
here and here and then as we get down a
little<00:03:30.990> bit<00:03:31.380> further<00:03:31.620> we're<00:03:32.250> seeing<00:03:32.520> more<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
little bit further we're seeing more of

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.760 
little bit further we're seeing more of
that<00:03:33.060> ESL<00:03:33.870> foam<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.650> be

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
that ESL foam that is going to be

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.100 
that ESL foam that is going to be
perforated<00:03:35.460> for<00:03:35.910> good<00:03:36.120> breathability<00:03:36.540> but

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
perforated for good breathability but

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.650 
perforated for good breathability but
also<00:03:37.290> very<00:03:37.650> protective<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:39.240> go<00:03:39.450> into<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
also very protective so now go into the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.150 
also very protective so now go into the
overall<00:03:39.930> fit<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.380> pant<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.860> gonna<00:03:40.980> be

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
overall fit of this pant it's gonna be

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.980 
overall fit of this pant it's gonna be
different<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> rest<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.600> 20

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
different and then the rest of the 20

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.080 
different and then the rest of the 20
and<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.410> 60s<00:03:43.890> but<00:03:44.190> pretty<00:03:44.550> similar<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:44.970> what

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and the 60s but pretty similar to what

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.060 
and the 60s but pretty similar to what
we<00:03:45.270> saw<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.660> 80<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.770> gonna<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.010> a

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
we saw on that 80 so it's gonna have a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.950 
we saw on that 80 so it's gonna have a
tapered<00:03:47.310> fit<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:47.910> up<00:03:48.120> in<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.360> hips<00:03:48.540> here<00:03:48.840> it's

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
tapered fit so up in the hips here it's

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.720 
tapered fit so up in the hips here it's
going<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.200> be<00:03:49.320> pretty<00:03:49.560> contouring<00:03:50.280> pretty

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
going to be pretty contouring pretty

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.280 
going to be pretty contouring pretty
snug<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.300> hips<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.690> once<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.960> get<00:03:52.080> down
