lately is this particular cabin bed one
of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> reason<00:00:39.510> why<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.260> went<00:00:40.440> over<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
of the reason why we we went over this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
of the reason why we we went over this
cabin<00:00:41.309> bed<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:42.300> because<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.840> air

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
conditioner on of course the main reason

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
conditioner on of course the main reason
was<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:49.050> rest<00:00:49.350> free<00:00:49.710> bed<00:00:49.950> rest

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
was if this is a more rest free bed rest

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
going to put the heater core inside here

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.089 
going to put the heater core inside here
just<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.750> standard<00:02:13.170> sized<00:02:13.379> heater<00:02:13.680> core<00:02:13.950> that

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
just a standard sized heater core that

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.620 
just a standard sized heater core that
will<00:02:14.220> fit<00:02:14.430> because<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.000> can't<00:02:15.209> find<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.540> here

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
will fit because I can't find it here

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.360 
will fit because I can't find it here
before<00:02:15.780> though<00:02:16.079> here<00:02:16.319> where<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.280> supposed

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
before though here where it's supposed

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.789 
before though here where it's supposed
to<00:02:17.670> go<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.180> way<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.079> way<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.590> will<00:02:19.650> at

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
to go that way and that way we will at

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.780 
to go that way and that way we will at
least<00:02:19.829> have<00:02:20.220> heat<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.360> wintertime<00:02:21.660> now

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
least have heat in the wintertime now

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.509 
least have heat in the wintertime now
make<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.819> more<00:02:24.060> difficult<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.720> mix<00:02:25.280> heat<00:02:26.280> and

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
make it more difficult to mix heat and

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.190 
make it more difficult to mix heat and
cool<00:02:26.730> bear<00:02:26.970> say<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.510> spring<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.260> fall<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.480> hot

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
cool bear say the spring and fall so hot

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.460 
cool bear say the spring and fall so hot
so<00:02:31.799> cold<00:02:32.130> therefore<00:02:32.760> your<00:02:32.910> defroster<00:02:33.660> but

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
so cold therefore your defroster but

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.350 
so cold therefore your defroster but
I'll<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.829> to<00:02:35.040> make<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.250> sacrifice<00:02:35.459> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
I'll just have to make that sacrifice I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000 
I'll just have to make that sacrifice I
don't<00:02:36.599> know<00:02:36.750> any<00:02:36.959> other<00:02:37.200> ways<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.799> like<00:02:37.980> a

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
talking about on this 67 install the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.300 
talking about on this 67 install the
heater<00:03:03.450> core<00:03:03.690> up<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.079> there<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.620> against<00:03:05.069> where

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
heater core up in there up against where

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920 
heater core up in there up against where
the<00:03:05.519> opening<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.090> where<00:03:06.329> all<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> air<00:03:06.690> goes

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the opening is where all the air goes

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.309 
the opening is where all the air goes
into<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> heating<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.620> cooling<00:03:07.709> unit<00:03:08.340> and

into the heating and cooling unit and

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.349 
into the heating and cooling unit and
that's<00:03:10.319> how<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:11.010> hook<00:03:11.519> our<00:03:11.730> heater<00:03:12.060> hoses

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
that's how we will hook our heater hoses

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.449 
that's how we will hook our heater hoses
are<00:03:12.599> underneath<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.200> hook<00:03:13.950> feeling<00:03:14.280> where

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
are underneath a hook feeling where

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.220 
are underneath a hook feeling where
they're<00:03:14.579> supposed<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.000> other<00:03:15.959> than<00:03:16.139> that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
they're supposed to go other than that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.780 
they're supposed to go other than that
it<00:03:16.380> should<00:03:16.410> operate<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.579> heater

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it should operate just like the heater

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.309 
it should operate just like the heater
did<00:03:18.000> before<00:03:18.389> we'll<00:03:18.750> still<00:03:18.989> all<00:03:19.109> lit<00:03:19.290> up

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
did before we'll still all lit up

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.099 
did before we'll still all lit up
properly<00:03:19.889> so<00:03:20.220> that's<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.299> only<00:03:21.540> ideal<00:03:21.900> I've

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
properly so that's the only ideal I've

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.599 
properly so that's the only ideal I've
got<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.590> fix<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.069> situation<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:24.480> get<00:03:25.200> air

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
got to fix the situation that get air

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.289 
got to fix the situation that get air
