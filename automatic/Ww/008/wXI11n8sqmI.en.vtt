00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.580
 make a little cool breaker to the king of 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.890
 now it's like the role of the gift that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.480
 now has engine 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.480

 so let's see there is complete the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.839
 combat to see what combat we have today 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.640
 in the previous chapter how I brought them 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.090
 two combats our people pernil 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.040
 breaker 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.160
 the two that I think were a round and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.170
 then another good today is no matter what happens 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.710
 I'm going to do it for you because the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.360
 next I think it would be even 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.310
 could do it also two because the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.350
 next would be what it would be 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 the over the limit and that's where it ends 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.700
 this second part of the history of the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 patience with the game the w3c 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.810
