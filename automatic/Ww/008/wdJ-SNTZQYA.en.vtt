00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.810
 robert vor fach live yes and today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.760
 I want to tell you two things 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.130
 show my victorinox pocketknife 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.170
 I do not myself for a long time 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.360
 maybe they knew but for the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.330
 interesting one or the other of you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 I can not and I do not know 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.980
 exactly the name of this knife 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.930
 but it has many among others 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.660
 tools including this one 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 pens and it is times 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.390
 basically a great thing 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.309
 I find a handy thing if you can 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.460
 always a ballpoint pen doing that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.070
 knife but by the way long time my etc 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 which always bothered me a bit 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 the pen does indeed write 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 wonderful that is not a problem so 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.440
 this mine but somehow reasonable 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.059
 to hold in your hand is simply not 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.660
 then too easy that slips there 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 and forth 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.579
 It's just a ballpen mine 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.829
 and really comfortable looks different 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.510
 out 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.910
 and as I said now I'll show you once 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.470
 What like that but quite useful 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 can use 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.310
 and we have many of these 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.680
 pocketknives check this off english 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.330
 take care where many are actually in the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 network or some in the network about it 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.370
 amuse me why he is there while me 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 last time I saw a video 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.390
 i think of a canadian and a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 has mentioned among other things that one 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.650
 probably Canadian canadian kates what I am 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 I'll just translate with you 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 skate that one for the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.210
 skid somehow really great here take 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.260
 can 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.479
 Unfortunately, I do not have it right 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.590
 understood what he meant exactly there 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.500
 I myself do not skate 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 and he did not mean to have that now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 the laces off the skates 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.720
 So that was not wearing anything in it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 relating to the runners 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.540
 if you know something closer 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.479
 We like to comment 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 write in but otherwise he will of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.130
 many regarded it as meaningless so what you can 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 but now can do it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.650
 that means I take this mine once 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.610
 and the right, and already I can 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.020
 carry my victorinox away 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.690
 no, that was only one of course 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.420
 joke so we have the hook 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.320
 unfolded and now I take mine 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.260
 pen expression 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.260
 and that practically here in these 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 slot where previously the park in aachen 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.940
 always work out the hook-a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.330
 Of course, he does not quite lock in now 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.690
 and now I have the mine fixed here 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.640
 in it 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.890
 By the way, the ring is not here 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.630
 is so and now i can really do that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.620
 like a normal, slightly thicker pen 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.230
 hold and came super comfortable 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.430
 to write that works 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.510
 really great that is now 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.010
 really good in the hand 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.550
 mine bake in it also not great around 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.500
 is really stable 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.470
 can you give me a little bit out now ? 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.330
 pull if I wanted so it goes 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.610
 everything properly a terrific 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.110
 I do not know if that 's from the story 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.190
 victorinox engineers too 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.850
 was provided 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.170
 if yes hat off a really great solution 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.270
 and I guess that's how you use it 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.640
 pens much more often when 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.360
 which is simply very good in the hand 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.290
 and as I said so on the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.290
 whole story what 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.120
 of course if I need to do it then 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.189
 just want to take off 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.980
 This rail is also visible 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.739
 nothing banned or anything else 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.930
 everything paletti and humor again 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.930
 gone and the second thing I still left you 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.829
 wants to show 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.170
 you may already have one now 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.629
 10 bit in the image and that it's time 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.260
 I have to go here and this blue munich 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.530
 here's it 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.490
 Although it is a pinhead at 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:56.050
 many knives just wider 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:59.620
 because it is so so 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.600
 here in the handle look a hole in it 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.210
 is and in this hole is no 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.310
 pin that is no longer the 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.560
 original pin the originals have 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.210
 I did not lost again 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.860
 that's why I have a normal one 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.900
 but sticks with the colorful head 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.700
 the original pin that is in there 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.670
 this much flatter 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.460
 therefore it does not fall so on 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.990
 practically here in the hole in it 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.610
 So that is not as far as how 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.370
 this replacement pin but also this 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.770
 has no influence on the corkscrew 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.660
 everything fits perfectly together it 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.020
 nothing stands over and I even think so 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.910
 you can grab her a bit better 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.500
 by just that head 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.639
 a little bit bigger than that too 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.889
 always 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.590
 By the way, also the ballpoint pen look 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.360
 We in side and toothpicks you can 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.159
 order separately at the pin 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.289
 Wise is not now but I think 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.080
 It does not have to be a work either 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.930
 you have a pin at home that is for 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.439
 So I just wanted to give you one theme 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.360
 demonstrate 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.860
 maybe it has one or the other 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.719
 continue to buy or were 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.590
 interesting tips write it in the 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.219
 Comments 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.580
 even if you have other attachments 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.830
 mounting options for the 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.629
 you probably like pens 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.590
 video answer dranhÃ¤ngen or in the 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.110
 Write comments 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.150
 I say pretty much for watching 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.099
 stay healthy all the way to health 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.099
 next time 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.099
 Hello
