00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.350
 coches.net we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.740
 this process gt we will occupy please 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.220
 two 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220
 to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 d 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.860
 we started 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.470
 well this out 4 meters and 31 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.990
 centimeters of the most powerful car and more 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.150
 fast that has guidance in its range this 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.770
 guide protect yourself from the one who makes 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.610
 five doors so good here are three 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.790
 doors and has a 1.6 or more nor 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.110
 less than 204 horses and these 204 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.960
 horses or lincoln the truth is that 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.350
 They are pretty pretty accomplished 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.240
 quite accomplished and quite evident 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.520
 the acceleration despite everything remains 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.770
 7.7 is not a panacea not 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.320
 make no mistake, but the truth is that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.300
 the sensations of the car are therefore not 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.210
 I'm going to say it's a premium car but 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.000
 the finished ones in noticing it hard of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.760
 notice it then look, this is it 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.830
 soft with the browser with a 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.840
 fantastic screen especially look 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.420
 because it has a gt button that we give to the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.900
 gt button and it transforms and you can see 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.090
 there then the pressure of the turbo 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.619
 revolutions let's say it changes a 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.330
 little bit and it gives an aspect more people a 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.560
 little bit sportier than the truth is 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.970
 we quite like you 're not going to 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.050
 cheat manual change of six 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.440
 speeds 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.270
 put more luxury and I love that no 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.320
 There is no automatic change or an option 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.320
 because, well 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.200
 it's a car that stretches almost to the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.930
 seven thousand laps is a car that will 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.700
 I say that to have that feeling of 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.730
 recent driving sports driving 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.290
 and well then hit some joy 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.640
 Week announcement or do-it-yourself 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.460
 so many the circuit the truth is that it is 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.410
 a car that jolines is fastened enough 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.150
 brakes especially very well has the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.190
 plan-e durito feel that sporty touch 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.740
 they need all cars good 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.170
 Well, they have to be people, it's like 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.720
 this yacht said that they are 4 meters and 31 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.760
 centimeters thousand 359 kilos 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.460
 if that's an eye back then you're going to see 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 that space is not the panacea but 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.680
 three adults can take a trip without 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.880
 work problems 380 liters of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.620
 trunk that are also quite 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.370
 got and especially what I want 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.500
 make you see is that for less than used in 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.390
 around 23 thousand euros 23 thousand 50 euros 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.130
 you can have a car with sensations 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.400
 very sporty as you see here we need 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.780
 the roof is missing this flyer that we 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.850
 it seems a little big the steering wheel does not 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.980
 let's cheat but good leather 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.560
 topped with red stitching as well 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.870
 Well that trims the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 seats that are also expensive and the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.010
 truth is that they are phenomenal 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.040
 the feelings that it guides when 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.409
 he wants to make a car 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.079
 really good with quality can do it 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.489
 perfectly without any problem and we 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.829
 we like it because that tells us 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.450
 that little by little it is going to continue 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.030
 raising the bar is no longer the brand 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.980
 who came to Spain 10 years ago and what 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.080
 good that he had cars that were 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.530
 they were sold more than anything because they were more 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.200
 cheap that the competition now not only 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.459
 jolÃ­n your whole but after 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.080
 these are cars that are very very very 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.569
 well as you can see in this guide places 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.409
 that you the small advance as always 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.000
 in video that we do in cutting 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.040
 coches.net web page of reference to 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.930
 motor world and I do not you 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.330
 would lose the written analysis we do 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.690
 in our web of this guide perception 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.690
 so
