which then last but like two weeks

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.870 
which then last but like two weeks
because<00:00:26.189> my<00:00:26.760> hair<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.859> blunt<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
because my hair is so like blunt and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840 
because my hair is so like blunt and
it's<00:00:30.330> curly<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.619> any<00:00:31.859> moisture<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.669> made

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850

really<00:00:34.710> nasty<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> decided<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
really nasty so I decided to do the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
really nasty so I decided to do the
crochet<00:00:37.140> method<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.370> my<00:00:38.610> hair<00:00:38.820> would

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
crochet method because all my hair would

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.790 
crochet method because all my hair would

um it took me about five hours it took
me<00:01:53.380> like<00:01:54.930> three<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.140> half<00:01:56.170> hours<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.950> the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
me like three and a half hours to do the

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.540 
front and then I were to have to the
back<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.260> I'm<00:01:59.800> thinking<00:02:00.040> that's<00:02:00.250> because

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
back and I'm thinking that's because

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580
