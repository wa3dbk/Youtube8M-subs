00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so my friends welcome back to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.230
 another surface even one 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.929
 pokémon xy live battles today we go 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.719
 against hurry was a yes against 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.950
 this girl was a miss and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 she was the first one then really 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.279
 I mean help yesterday yesterday 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.449
 during the 1st 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 while playing while algeria 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.400
 has responded and accordingly 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.859
 I said you know what to write 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.050
 suite with your fc and the mode you like 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 prefer and she said then we 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 Go a mode in which you just 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.719
 both a legendary of the benefit of the rest 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.129
 is wayne and then i thought i know 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.920
 you what is the perfect opportunity 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.590
 to use a choral lenderich 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 a corrales demetrius and yes she has 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 then resorted to unsuspecting and multi-combat 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.870
 then you gladly did that you will eat 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.879
 So, just experience it yourself 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 campaign so cool the mode I have 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 just played out of the heroes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.390
 take a look at this pokémon read here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.500
 against one 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 female pokémon force we have to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 also a very nice was criticized 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
 already say you have to fast synonymous 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.110
 I'll mention it to everyone 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 case really cool so popstar not 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.260
 some points are still playing 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.479
 I always think of wifi battle 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.700
 great so i thought with my hydra 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.510
 the goal julia which reinforces the focus 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.040
 and she starts off with her and me 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.490
 black in times of the game actually 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 relatively sure are unsuspecting with the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 is normal of pippi active churches 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.140
 but that's why circuit connection with dolls 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.020
 then has hardly deducted anything 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.820
 which I found very poor yes 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.530
 there was the occasion in which 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.150
 ashamed of power used has been used 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.350
 a location city run grow and that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.119
 second time they are missing again 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 used force I put the second 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.869
 We have already been on the field 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.290
 a whopping 12 percent damage the heat in 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.660
 pokemon of our opponent 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.880
 every time who enter the ground 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.160
 Touching harm inflicts something on everyone 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.020
 case is if any points 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.020
 how a focus sales say side by side 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.810
 on your side to defeat and to 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.510
 Time of the game relatively safe that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.160
 may be a kind of cinema and water 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.489
 I'm still not sure what in 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.019
 he could not possibly be 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.580
 be better if you do what a 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.630
 Type that is then you can me on each 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.110
 If necessary, let me know and I'll be awesome 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.170
 are there and mega team his psycho 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.440
 Of course, psychologist is enough for that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.750
 agnus dei I would say 75 percent 40 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.489
 percent of coffee still to be defeated and that 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.170
 is cool has mega are all that is 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.600
 she also changes her loburg 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.630
 and lopatka the comparative rent is so 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.330
 the book and was the real policy 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.209
 heel and simsalabim lay tracked by 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.040
 to copy and have with her blog 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.920
 we now a simple with a lot of mega 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.049
 special attack and mega plays a lot because 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.390
 it just snows shoe grint in the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.130
 in general, are not really cool 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.530
 is not one of the better mega in vain 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.670
 pokémon is extremely happy to be in 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.260
 late and extremely horny 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.210
 I think new mut waves 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.150
 special attack and I wanted this 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.100
 impulse then also with the focus 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.230
 So place defeat focus kick 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.130
 but unfortunately she is in the pole of the situation 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.530
 to evade attack and yes I know 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.810
 Just tell me that I'm in the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.700
 situation would have been or would have been you 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.180
 complete themes with mega sinners too 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.130
 defeat 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.930
 at the mega seller simple cash book 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.660
 roland I think I wish one 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.070
 psycho focus including energy at work 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.290
 Citizens but grab the last courage 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.720
 was actually still a cool force for 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.430
 me but the courage pool so that already 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 first role where won can says 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.980
 loos complete pokémon and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.120
 of course , I wanted it, of course 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.590
 behave and yes I play 20 see how 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.250
 unnecessarily because're still get out to 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.340
 switch 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.400
 and since I knew that myself 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.090
 maybe a little different maybe not so 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 aggressive is the finger leaves something 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.400
 maybe a gap in my team 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.290
 could start but we have god 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.970
 thanks to opti with eros limited with 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.870
 carer and an extremely good feedback 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.419
 and I always reserve cool 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.190
 he already has those with you and you 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.959
 Please now wide bit strange 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.430
 its been that we were there like this 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.900
 rewrote a bit weird and that 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.500
 Of course, animal is capable of that 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.560
 defeat income that is so hot and is 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.520
 Meanwhile , percent experts broke this 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.540
 but defeat earthquakes from that 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.250
 me the east and of course no weed 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.500
 grown up and their last look and 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.820
 land rover I was relatively sure 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.169
 that this before the citizens with 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.860
 he also did not break a cash register 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.880
 can defeat 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.400
 That's why I wanted a little bit more 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.640
 I style make it easy to take time 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.430
 like to use mine with iris out 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.690
 changes and then polish again 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.860
 need sound blaster and otherwise 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.470
 leave because that helped me and loud 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.840
 four times more resistant teams off too 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.849
 if that's what people know, but it does 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.470
 but often pursues resistance 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.840
 Of course, hardly anything off and then comes 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.970
 Dragon's desk and pulse is then enough around 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.930
 to defeat that level or she that 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.960
 I would like to say 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.099
 Berlin and if yes when you play 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.140
 you want to be a bit 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.229
 active on twitter you follow on twitter 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.210
 and facebook page for there essential 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.270
 sometimes every now and then 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.130
 even smaller posts namely then opponents 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.630
 so find visitors and I will with it 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.190
 no longer prefer the take the 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.500
 Of course, there were first 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.210
 because first come first serve 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.310
 at this point very much said if you 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.099
 should have fought and me 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.980
 The recorded then have his love 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.020
 and 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.420
 jannis a little bad if I rather then 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.370
 others do not take that against them 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.660
 have fought yes no there is 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.340
 maybe again forbidden vision 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.060
 namely times against a fighter 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.230
 but for most then of course 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.460
 if you ever even think about it waits then let 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.620
 the others who were not there yet 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.270
 with preference and yes I think 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.590
 Of course, very fragrant or a very 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.180
 Thank you very much for that 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.750
 trainers work well until the next 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.750
 three quarters
