00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
differently I thought really flat going

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.960 
differently I thought really flat going
into<00:00:34.149> the<00:00:34.239> fight<00:00:34.510> I<00:00:35.250> remember<00:00:36.250> walking<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.700> it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
into the fight I remember walking to it

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.870 
into the fight I remember walking to it
was<00:00:37.150> the<00:00:37.300> ring<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:38.020> just<00:00:38.200> didn't<00:00:38.470> feel<00:00:38.500> that

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
was the ring and I just didn't feel that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.300 
was the ring and I just didn't feel that
you<00:00:39.880> know<00:00:40.390> excitement<00:00:41.079> all<00:00:41.260> that<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:42.010> was

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
you know excitement all that that was

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.010 
you know excitement all that that was
about<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.790> five<00:00:42.970> useful<00:00:43.270> in<00:00:43.420> there<00:00:43.570> for<00:00:43.750> me<00:00:43.840> I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
about the five useful in there for me I

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.430 
about the five useful in there for me I
don't<00:00:44.380> know<00:00:44.440> why<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.620> was<00:00:45.010> um<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:46.180> think<00:00:46.810> it<00:00:47.200> is

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
don't know why that was um I think it is

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.280 
don't know why that was um I think it is
so<00:00:48.130> well<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:49.059> felt<00:00:49.300> like<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.750> pressure<00:00:50.020> was

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290
