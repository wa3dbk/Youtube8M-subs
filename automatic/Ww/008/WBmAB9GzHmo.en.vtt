it<00:01:11.020> again<00:01:11.259> as<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.920> meant<00:01:12.189> to<00:01:12.280> be<00:01:12.369> prepared<00:01:12.759> for

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
it again as I meant to be prepared for

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.109 
it again as I meant to be prepared for
the<00:01:13.000> game<00:01:13.150> etc<00:01:13.810> etc<00:01:14.009> so<00:01:15.009> it's<00:01:15.490> not<00:01:15.610> about<00:01:15.820> good

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
the game etc etc so it's not about good

and come back the next day so the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.120 
and come back the next day so the
difference<00:01:31.840> between<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:32.140> successful<00:01:32.350> person

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
difference between a successful person

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.679 
difference between a successful person
and<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.430> unsuccessful<00:01:33.729> person<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.509> have

and the unsuccessful person to have

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.109 
and the unsuccessful person to have
equal<00:01:35.049> talents<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.560> equal<00:01:35.890> abilities<00:01:36.340> that

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
equal talents to equal abilities that

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.179 
equal talents to equal abilities that
the<00:01:37.270> successful<00:01:37.659> person<00:01:38.170> kept<00:01:38.409> going<00:01:38.799> every

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
the successful person kept going every

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.429 
the successful person kept going every
time<00:01:39.369> they<00:01:39.520> got<00:01:39.640> knocked<00:01:39.909> down<00:01:40.320> despite<00:01:41.320> the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
time they got knocked down despite the

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.690 
time they got knocked down despite the
fact<00:01:41.680> they<00:01:41.829> got<00:01:41.979> knocked<00:01:42.189> down<00:01:42.430> and

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
fact they got knocked down and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.090 
fact they got knocked down and
unsuccessful<00:01:43.479> person<00:01:43.840> quit<00:01:44.079> and<00:01:44.680> they<00:01:44.860> went

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
unsuccessful person quit and they went

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
unsuccessful person quit and they went
and<00:01:45.250> try<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.490> do<00:01:45.700> something<00:01:46.030> else

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and try to do something else

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.810 
and try to do something else
that's<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.619> difference<00:01:48.039> so<00:01:48.310> if<00:01:48.399> you<00:01:48.520> want<00:01:48.729> to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
that's the difference so if you want to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.270 
that's the difference so if you want to
recover<00:01:49.570> from<00:01:49.899> anything<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:50.860> happens<00:01:51.189> that

recover from anything that happens that
you<00:01:51.340> didn't<00:01:51.820> want<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.060> happen<00:01:52.299> any<00:01:52.659> situation

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
you didn't want to happen any situation

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.080 
you didn't want to happen any situation
that<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.380> weren't<00:01:53.619> planning<00:01:54.100> for<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.880> just
