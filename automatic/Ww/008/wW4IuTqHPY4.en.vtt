00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.209
 several times in between 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.579
 remembering that they have to stay on top 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.280
 on the top of the block so 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.010

 public please, Rafael, we're going to give that friend 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.290
 with whom I had donors time and if I did not 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:35.590
 I'm wrong so I'll put one more. 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.810
 block that has how many blocks here 123456 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.919
 there are six blocks in the module i party 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.079

 rafa the two are 2 or 3 tv from here 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.230
 I think it's four blocks while 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.269
 circular but I'm not mistaken in four 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.400
 hours it rained is who the law until only 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.290
