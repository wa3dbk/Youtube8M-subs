00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.490
 just as you are welcome to a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 unboxing of my new iphone as you are 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.860
 seeing already I told you yesterday in the blog of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.179
 and senna code dotcom this is my new 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.580
 iphone chosen the iphone 6 in 64 gigas and 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.890
 in space gray color and if you want 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.749
 I'm going to tell you a little bit because why of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 this election but good in the meantime 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.380
 let's go opening opening what 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.750
 it never hurts, we're going to cut a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.520
 little plastic here you know 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 that I'm not much of unboxing 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.050
 but good saying a device so 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.150
 special as an iphone that the truth is 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770
 that at least I like to follow 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.260
 the and boxes of this kind of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.240
 so premium devices so good go 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.210
 I'm going to throw myself and I'm going to do an unboxing 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.230
 of my new iphone good because chosen 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.060
 this device instead of 6 plus what 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 true is that he yes is pla will be my 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.860
 first option was it is much better 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.130
 device has better battery on 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.020
 everything has better camera and better screen 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.360
 of course but the truth is that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 regarding the screen 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 I just that also in another video of the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.100
 differences of what I think but what 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 it's true that I've been two months 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.570
 using the one plus one that also 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.640
 it has 5.5 inch screen and what 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.410
 truth is that I have not yet made 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.240
 he there are many people who say good you 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.240
 you take the 6 plas and in a short time you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.130
 you do to him and you handle him perfectly 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 I do not agree, what I think is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.540
 than with a 5.5 screen mobile 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.390
 inches you really get used to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.280
 use it in a certain way 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.220
 but you never did it to him 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.369
 you always have to resort to certain 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.050
 tasks to bring the hand a second 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 hand to reach all the parts of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.509
 the screen however this iphone 6 of 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.700
 4.7 inches is perfect to the screen 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.619
 because it came practically as you see 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.970
 all the sites plus I'm me 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.380
 I'm holding back for not throwing myself 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.759
 mourn how nice it is well 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.550
 I was looking forward to a change had the iphone 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.770
 white and good this space gray the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.800
 truth is that I think it's super cool 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.750
 let's leave it here in a little way here 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.610
 to see how beautiful it is and we are going to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.680
 follow a little bit I do not like me either 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.900
 much this kind of thing just what 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.849
 that all stand out to tell you that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.500
 excels and here we have the space to 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.090
 the camera here we have the triptychs there 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.189
 I'm going to take it out okay but we found 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.890
 here with the pin to take out the tray 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.569
 sim and good here we have the stickers 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.040
 typical liquor that I always say I'm going 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.470
 to put an apple of these in the car 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.819
 and then I never do this touch 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.040
 when I see people who have the apple 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.109
 in the car in the back 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.000
 ostia what hipster does not or how cool is the 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.010
 apple no and I never just put him 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.629
 but do not be someday animals and the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.060
 I will not put two and if it's cool for you 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.400
 that kind of thing guys always 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.920
 the spots the headphones with microphone 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.900
 and volume control very well protected 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.980
 and it 's been two years using them for the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.810
 iphone 5 the truth that I am 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 delighted with the ser potts we 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.889
 we found with the standard charger that 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.310
 by the way it is one ampere despite 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.599
 that this new iphone 6 charges 2.1 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.340
 amps we can load it with the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.500
 ipad charger that holds more 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.510
 intensity and therefore more load 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.430
 yes I understand fast that follow 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.349
 putting on the charger one amp 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.299
 for a simple reason they must have 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.560
 lots of stock of the stock 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.310
 they want it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.079
 remove from above 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.470
 I understand that that will come with the 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.380
 charger 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.660
 1 amps and good lightning cable 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.850
 to do the synchronization and the load 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.160
 and all those things and basically guys 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.840
 this is what comes in this iphone and 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.210
 these are the reasons why I have 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.360
 caught this and not the plan basically by 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.520
 the screen helped a lot because of the theme of 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.610
 the battery the 6 plastic a battery 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.320
 enviable but the truth is that good 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.960
 for me, much more predominates 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.250
 usability and with this iphone we are going to 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.930
 do the first turn on if you think 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.970
 guys let's see what happens we're going to 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.140
 take away this is not so ugly to me what 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.970
 first thing to do when you take 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.040
 something for me is to remove the plastics 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.750
 these the truth is that touch is very 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.410
 nice guys the rounded shapes 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.310
 I love this color space gray me 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.080
 Like very much 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.480
 I do not know what you think about things that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.980
 I do not like it is that the camera stands out 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.380
 a little bit therefore when you put it 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.239
 at the table the truth is that it makes a 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.799
 little bit of boat like going through here in this 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.290
 area here is also nothing of the other 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.940
 world but good it shows the buttons have 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.370
 changed position as you are seeing 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.010
 above all it is a new design the truth 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.510
 is that we keep the double flash led 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.210
 as you are seeing around here although the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.979
 hole is round 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.020
 and we are going to light it come so 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.430
 you see it in the theme of 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.199
 battery the truth is that this 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.970
 device supposedly has two 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.440
 accelerometers and with these two 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.389
 Accelerometers seems to be managed 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.940
 better the battery in such a way that 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.770
 we have a three-axis accelerometer and 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.569
 another six and the three axes for 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.669
 everyday tasks the truth is that it makes 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.710
 that consumes a lot less and endurance 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.920
 much more when we do tasks that 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.290
 they use the accelerometer of course not 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.990
 another pretty important fact by which 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.210
 I have decided for him is the screen 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.190
 it seems that no but apart from the 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.470
 usability the screen so big I 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.000
 I think it's for another generation because 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.920
 The truth is that still 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.250
 applications are not adapted to that 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.080
 new iphone 6 screen flash so 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.370
 we will both have months maybe years or 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.500
 maybe we will never see all the 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.060
 applications that we use 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.390
 adapted for that screen however 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.220
 in a next generation surely already 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.560
 there will be applications that will have a 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.180
 specific interface for 6 plus and 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.890
 Now maybe it's a little bit soon I 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.480
 I think this screen is perfect not 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.070
 I know things seem guys this has been the 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.210
 boxing let's talk a little bit about my 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.650
 feelings how long does the battery 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.480
 I feel myself with this new device 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.250
 It was about guys that if you liked it 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.080
 you can support us with a like and that 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.080
 see you in a next video chao
