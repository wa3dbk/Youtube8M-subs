00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.790
 the project to write the fun 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.790
 consists 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.760
 with writing and they doing about 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.850
 all satisfied when they see 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.040
 those books once a week round 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.899
 every day of school and around 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.730
 workshop is taught the various 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.690
 techniques for writing the 32 stories 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.760
 for example here we have a poetry that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.949
 It has helped us to teach the technique 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.309
 to write a story from a 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.309
 poem 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.260
 a poem and we analyze 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 what main main character and 6 and 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.950
 so from his ideas we started to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950
 be good 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.540
 what we want to achieve with children is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.330
 what 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.240
 have a taste you can write what you do not 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 it is an obligation but it is a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.040
 enjoy writing a story 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 that they can see a product at the end 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.800
 reflected 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.439
 we want to worship at the end of all the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.330
 center 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.000
 the printing of a book called 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.190
 write in fun where kids 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.310
 You can see not only your accounts 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.840
 uncles uncle and also some articles 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.840
 that they will see on the part of the director 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.610
 we like him 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.989
 with children in the beautiful 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.430
 I also remember when the school or the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.430
 school could do my job 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.769
 and we believe that when we stay 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.430
 we want at the end of the year children 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.750
 not only take 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.750
 also like that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.360
 of the Peruvians because millions more 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.790
 few rural people dare to do 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.130
 I invite you all to collaborate with this 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.410
 project is something that is going to be done 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.420
 for the first time here at school and 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.920
 We believe that you will learn reproductions 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.130
 both in this school and in other 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.130
 schools 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.200
 is 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.200
 if not
