00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
down a cardboard so the idea has been

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.330 
down a cardboard so the idea has been
here<00:02:43.910> for<00:02:44.090> years<00:02:44.299> just<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:45.079> now<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.920> we

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
here for years just that now that we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.979 
here for years just that now that we
came<00:02:46.549> along<00:02:46.880> with<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.209> technology<00:02:47.959> that

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
came along with the technology that

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.120 
came along with the technology that
actually<00:02:48.350> works<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.250> riders<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.480> can<00:02:50.630> ride

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
actually works and riders that can ride

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.550 
actually works and riders that can ride

it's<00:03:00.980> kind<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.340> Formica<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:02.540> use<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> wax

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
it's kind of like Formica we use a wax

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.229 
it's kind of like Formica we use a wax
we<00:03:03.620> rub<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:03.859> on<00:03:04.040> pretty<00:03:04.310> much<00:03:04.459> every<00:03:04.760> run<00:03:04.970> you

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
we rub it on pretty much every run you

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.180

buff it in once you got your wax on and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.770 
buff it in once you got your wax on and
when<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.700> feel<00:03:08.030> slick<00:03:08.389> you<00:03:08.540> take<00:03:08.750> your<00:03:08.930> rug
