00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:13.330
 Everyone a favorite Macintosh from the Uchida is today of the spool my wardrobe 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.330
 We introduce to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.150
 This jacket cares about where British Grandpa and Grandma are likely to come 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.320
 I entered and bought 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.789
 In front of about maybe 8 years 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:35.469
 For me, it is one of the memorials for the first encounter with Macintosh 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:39.540
 I was looking for a beautiful color coat and I was looking for this range color 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:45.840
 I thought that the orange that I woke up was really pretty 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 I always wear black clothes, so orange is so perfect that I also care 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.680
 Is in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.680
 And above all I love Kogure 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 A pretty girl with a great side-view silhouette 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.250
 It seems to say that this coat 7 is closed down but they are still jackets 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.620
 In terms of incorporating details 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.760
 can I think and because quite slim and in wonder if a little unusual form macintosh 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.120
 It is amazing when 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.740
 Also the place that looks neat I mean look portrait 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.329
 I think it is very good slate 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.770
 At the same so detached that trigger far to across a lot of season 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.020
 I also like where you can come 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:35.259
 I also have a Macintosh p coat 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:39.429
 I know this later, but it's super thin and a little like a jacket 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.270
 Code is jacket-ish sense to take you is not very like that make me collar 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.450
 Though 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.400
 I think that this form be nice parentheses also make a collar 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.590
 When also been set up 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.520
 I bought this coat last year but it is my first love coat 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.200
 I like that 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 I have no eyes to say what is dreaming with black lines 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 And because it was a favorite Macintosh , I thought it was a good throw filled with favorite things 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.369
 is 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 Favorite place of this coat is 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.430
 The silhouette when I squeezed the waist is very beautiful 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:24.400
 It's a pretty adult feeling and I 'm still an adult but I can wear it with an adult feeling 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:29.680
 In a nutshell the theme when cutting this coat is actress style 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.549
 Now I'm aiming for this poncho type packing and the main 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.200
 It's a new form but form Te Poncho' is life 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:41.670
 I think that the material with this needle is very good when it comes to that day, even on rainy days 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.670
 It is a pretty form that looks good
