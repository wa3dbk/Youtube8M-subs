first of all first for most players a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
notably quite selfish so I think first

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.870 
notably quite selfish so I think first
of<00:01:58.869> all<00:01:58.960> dig<00:01:59.170> well-to-do<00:01:59.649> not<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.640> job<00:02:00.850> for

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
themselves and I think the cloud that's

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.699 
themselves and I think the cloud that's
all<00:02:05.350> worth<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:06.539> over<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.630> audit<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.440> club

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
all worth it over the audit the club

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.610 
all worth it over the audit the club
then<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.190> fans<00:02:09.429> it's<00:02:10.390> very<00:02:10.630> hard<00:02:10.869> not<00:02:10.990> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
then the fans it's very hard not the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.040 
then the fans it's very hard not the

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
to be honest because as I say some of

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.710 
to be honest because as I say some of
the<00:05:07.510> players<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:07.900> really<00:05:08.260> committed<00:05:08.650> me<00:05:08.800> and

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
the players I really committed me and

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.010 
the players I really committed me and
then<00:05:10.889> it's<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.580> tactics<00:05:13.300> don't<00:05:13.479> fit<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.840> team

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
then it's the tactics don't fit the team

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.900 
then it's the tactics don't fit the team
for<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.260> last<00:05:14.320> five<00:05:14.650> years<00:05:14.729> we've<00:05:15.729> been

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
for the last five years we've been

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.450 
for the last five years we've been
playing<00:05:16.210> impressive<00:05:17.100> well<00:05:18.100> this<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.310> what<00:05:18.430> I

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
playing impressive well this is what I

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.340 
playing impressive well this is what I
mean<00:05:18.580> when<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.790> say<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.120> hard<00:05:19.300> desire<00:05:19.690> when<00:05:20.260> you

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
mean when I say the hard desire when you

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.350 
mean when I say the hard desire when you
don't<00:05:20.530> see<00:05:20.889> pressing<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:21.729> don't<00:05:21.910> see<00:05:22.090> players

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
don't see pressing you don't see players

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.040 
don't see pressing you don't see players
kill<00:05:22.660> themselves<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.229> get<00:05:23.380> up<00:05:23.530> there<00:05:23.830> it<00:05:24.190> looks

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
kill themselves to get up there it looks

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.390 
kill themselves to get up there it looks
like<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.350> players<00:05:26.590> out<00:05:26.800> there<00:05:26.860> without<00:05:27.130> but

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
like the players out there without but

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.189 
like the players out there without but
of<00:05:27.490> course<00:05:27.729> it<00:05:27.880> you<00:05:28.240> know<00:05:28.389> it's<00:05:28.720> probably<00:05:28.900> just

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
of course it you know it's probably just

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.080 
of course it you know it's probably just
a<00:05:29.470> question<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.160> telling<00:05:30.490> them<00:05:30.639> not<00:05:30.789> to<00:05:30.850> run

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
a question of telling them not to run

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.300 
a question of telling them not to run
but<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.240> can<00:05:31.449> understand<00:05:31.960> why<00:05:32.229> you<00:05:32.770> get<00:05:32.919> you

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
and then we put a little bit of pressure

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.800
