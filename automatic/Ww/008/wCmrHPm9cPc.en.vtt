00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
degree so when it comes to working out

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109 
degree so when it comes to working out
what<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:57.899> doing<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.670> working<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
what we're doing is working out is a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.639 
what we're doing is working out is a
piece<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> part<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.570> okay

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
piece of this it's a part of this okay

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.249 
piece of this it's a part of this okay
so<00:02:04.649> no<00:02:05.040> matter<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.689> workout

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
so no matter how you do your workout

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.120 
so no matter how you do your workout
what<00:02:08.039> you're<00:02:08.220> doing<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.610> you're<00:02:08.789> modifying

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
what you're doing is you're modifying

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.790 
what you're doing is you're modifying
influence<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:12.020> thermic<00:02:12.380> effective

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
influence to the thermic effective

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.430 
influence to the thermic effective
activity<00:02:13.280> which<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.850> an<00:02:13.970> influence<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.720> your

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
activity which is an influence to your

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.500 
activity which is an influence to your
total<00:02:15.800> caloric<00:02:16.100> expenditure<00:02:16.460> which<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.390> an

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
total caloric expenditure which is an

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.050 
total caloric expenditure which is an
influence<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.290> your<00:02:19.190> calorie<00:02:19.580> balance<00:02:19.760> which

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
influence to your calorie balance which

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.640 
influence to your calorie balance which
is<00:02:20.180> actually<00:02:20.540> what's<00:02:20.720> causing<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.350> amount<00:02:21.560> of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
is actually what's causing the amount of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.040 
is actually what's causing the amount of
body<00:02:21.800> fat<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.760> your<00:02:22.940> body<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.900> this

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
body fat that to be on your body so this

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.830 
body fat that to be on your body so this
is<00:02:24.260> why<00:02:24.580> nothing<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.940> do<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.270> workout<00:02:26.630> will

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
is why nothing you do in a workout will

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.550 
is why nothing you do in a workout will
ever<00:02:27.080> directly<00:02:27.830> cause<00:02:28.220> weight<00:02:28.760> loss<00:02:28.790> or<00:02:29.560> you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
ever directly cause weight loss or you

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.830 
ever directly cause weight loss or you
to<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.860> lean<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.850> just<00:02:32.090> doesn't<00:02:32.390> happen<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
to be lean it just doesn't happen it's a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.440 
to be lean it just doesn't happen it's a
piece<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.680> piece<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.490> piece<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
piece of a piece of a piece of the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.600 
piece of a piece of a piece of the
puzzle<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.410> it's<00:02:36.860> never<00:02:37.070> going<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.460> big

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
puzzle so it's never going to be a big

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.880 
puzzle so it's never going to be a big
thing<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:38.060> that's<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.470> manipulate

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
thing but that's it you can manipulate

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.870 
thing but that's it you can manipulate
your<00:02:40.400> workout<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.890> maximize<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.250> burn<00:02:43.520> more

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
your workout to maximize and burn more

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.760 
your workout to maximize and burn more
fat<00:02:44.150> calories<00:02:44.720> even<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.890> regardless<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.580> um

talking<00:03:09.500> about<00:03:09.590> building<00:03:09.830> muscle<00:03:10.160> okay<00:03:10.820> it's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
talking about building muscle okay it's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.060 
talking about building muscle okay it's
not<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.570> if<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.230> train<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> certain<00:03:12.920> way

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
not like if you train a certain way

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.470 
not like if you train a certain way
you're<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.490> get<00:03:13.700> one<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.030> these<00:03:14.150> things

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
you're going to get one of these things

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.870 
you're going to get one of these things
and<00:03:14.630> not<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.380> others<00:03:15.740> you're<00:03:16.490> always<00:03:16.670> going

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
and not the others you're always going

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.030 
and not the others you're always going
to<00:03:16.910> get<00:03:17.030> all<00:03:17.180> four<00:03:17.560> regardless<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.710> how<00:03:18.860> you're

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
to get all four regardless of how you're

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.890 
to get all four regardless of how you're
training<00:03:19.310> it's<00:03:19.610> just<00:03:20.120> where<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.720> emphasis

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
training it's just where is the emphasis

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.280 
training it's just where is the emphasis
around<00:03:21.740> these<00:03:21.920> things<00:03:22.210> so<00:03:23.210> we<00:03:23.780> have<00:03:23.960> three

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
around these things so we have three

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.050 
around these things so we have three
things<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.740> you<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.400> three<00:03:25.610> things<00:03:25.760> at

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
things that you have three things at

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.710 
things that you have three things at
your<00:03:26.240> disposal<00:03:26.630> okay<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.820> moving<00:03:28.820> more

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
your disposal okay you have moving more

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.550 
your disposal okay you have moving more
muscle<00:03:30.500> mass<00:03:31.360> simple<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.510> more<00:03:32.780> muscle<00:03:33.410> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
muscle mass simple the more muscle you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.230 
muscle mass simple the more muscle you
move<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.160> more<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.490> burn<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.120> why

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
move the more you burn this is why

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.970 
move the more you burn this is why
there's<00:03:35.510> never<00:03:35.660> going<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.960> be<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.260> weight<00:03:36.830> loss

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
