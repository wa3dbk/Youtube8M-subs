00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everybody today we are bringing 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 another experiment with electric batteries 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.960
 and this time the energy source 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:20.100
 is the sugar cane for the assembly of this 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 kit we will need 12 pieces of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.500
 cane 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.840
 measuring 4.5 centimeters 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.890
 we will also need 12 pieces of wire 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.540
 copper 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.930
 each measuring five centimeters 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.570
 we'll need 12 pieces of clip 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.360
 Metallic right also measuring 5 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 centimeters 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.160
 we will also need 13 pairs of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:54.600
 alligator claws with their wires 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.350
 we will need 12 elastics and a base 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 of wood measuring 55 centimeters 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.899
 length by 35 centimeters of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899
 width 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.840
 see how simple it is to build each 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.479
 battery 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.610
 that side of the pile it will secure the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.200
 negative pole of which is represented 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.049
 by the clip piece 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.020
 then it will put this is the negative 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.150
 from the stack to the same with another side only 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.729
 that here is going to be the copper wire that will be 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.530
 positive on this stack and will put 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.189
 then this form is already completed 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.380
 battery 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.150
 now we will not measure the pension that she 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 is supplying negative of the multimeter and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.090
 now connect the positive pole of the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.299
 multimeter and it records the attention of 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.939
 0.82 volts did not reach a volt 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.579
 if we want this stack to arrive a 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.740
 disputed the flight exceeds 1 volt 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.990
 we just put a few drops of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.299
 vinegar in each of the poles 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.579
 this voltage must exceed 1 volt 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.429
 now we will use a syringe to 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.410
 put the vinegar inside the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.230
 hole where the piece of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.549
 clip and the copper wire 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:23.400
 we are putting some vinegar and 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:26.909
 we are going to put the electrodes 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.720
 positive and negative to show that 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:35.489
 this tension should rise with vinegar is 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.580
 penetrating into sugar cane 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.819
 in total he has already positive is 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.840
 then putting the negative on the voltage 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.290
 rose to 1.03 volts 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.180
 then the first stack is completed and 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.459
 we will do the same with all of them 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.519
 here we are showing all the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.129
 batteries already built and now we 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.640
 the elastic each 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.200
 on the wooden base 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.000
 see also that this wooden base 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.400
 is fully qualified with the polarities 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.739
 and the voltage that each cell provides 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.150
 see how simple it is to put on the elastic 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.480
 in the wood 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.849
 it has two holes and behind the wood 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.090
 he is pulling right this elastic 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.709
 elastic is who will hold each 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.709
 daughters in this wooden base 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.130
 ok obeys in the polarity he is 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.239
 putting Bella will get stuck in this 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.069
 elastic 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.069
 see how very simple it is 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.390
 a battery is formed by a set of 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.210
 batteries connected in series is precisely the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.390
 what are we showing now because we 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.930
 we connect the 12 batteries in series 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.790
 In this battery the batteries have the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.700
 property of converting to energy 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.550
 chemistry in electrical energy 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.880
 is this transformation occurs when 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.490
 in a chemical reaction an element loses 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.130
 electrons that here in our experiment is 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.960
 the clip piece that he is 15 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.060
 he loses electrons 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.850
 the other dangerous element and electrons 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.220
 here represented in this experiment by 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.220
 piece of electric wire that is copper 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.970
 that the 12 persons 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.290
 series 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.980
 they will total approximately 12 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.970
 volts 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.960
 here it spent a little 12.61 volts 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.870
 he will disconnect here one of the terminals 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.380
 of one of the daughters and a multimeter he 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:13.240
 ceases to influence the attention it goes 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:20.140
 give it again and it returns to show the 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:23.979
 sum of 12 12 volt batteries 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:28.660
 is what this battery of cane is 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:32.680
 sugar is a fairly easy battery 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.530
 to do and has the advantage of a 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.390
 much longer than 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.690
 others we did in the experiments 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.810
 the potato lasts a lot 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.470
 but it spoils faster than 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.970
 that sugar cane is a sugar cane. 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.530
 experiment that will spend more time 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.130
 during the demonstrations at the 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.130
 science 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.880
 That's it, guys. Thank you so much for having 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.340
 watched 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.470
 we hope that this information can 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.070
 have been useful 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.590
 and please do not forget to sign up 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.270
 our channel on youtube and wait 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.930
 our next videos 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.930
 a big hug
