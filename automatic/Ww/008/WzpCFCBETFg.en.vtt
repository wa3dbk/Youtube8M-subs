00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.600 

let's<00:01:58.990> try<00:01:59.229> out<00:01:59.380> settings<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.920> 60<00:02:05.920> plus<00:02:06.130> fps

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
let's try out settings so 60 plus fps

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.050 
let's try out settings so 60 plus fps
that's<00:02:07.030> good<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> most

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
that's good and I think this is the most

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.650 
that's good and I think this is the most
preferable<00:02:13.420> settings<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.330> card

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
preferable settings for this card

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.830 
preferable settings for this card
maximum<00:02:17.590> solution<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.280> auto<00:02:19.530> reset<00:02:21.840> now

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
maximum solution and auto reset now

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.800 
maximum solution and auto reset now
let's<00:02:23.200> try<00:02:23.440> changing<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.920> resolution<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.090> I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
let's try changing the resolution so I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.270 
let's try changing the resolution so I
had<00:02:32.470> Auto<00:02:33.100> settings<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.140> illusion

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:51.809 

getting<00:02:40.080> 68<00:02:41.080> fps<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:42.610> good<00:02:43.060> right

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.199 

on<00:02:52.819> low<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.990> setting<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.830> FPS<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.370> like<00:02:55.880> 80

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
on low the setting the FPS is like 80

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.000 
on low the setting the FPS is like 80
plus<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.840> graphics<00:03:00.350> are<00:03:00.560> go

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
plus the graphics are go

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.420 
plus the graphics are go
I<00:03:02.500> wouldn't<00:03:03.500> prefer<00:03:03.680> playing<00:03:04.040> at<00:03:04.220> these

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
I wouldn't prefer playing at these

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:17.920 
I wouldn't prefer playing at these
settings<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.830> we<00:03:15.830> are<00:03:15.920> getting<00:03:16.160> 25<00:03:17.120> plus<00:03:17.420> FPS

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:37.099 

let's<00:03:33.219> try<00:03:33.400> changing<00:03:33.760> resolution<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.810> minimum

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
let's try changing resolution to minimum

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.959 
let's try changing resolution to minimum
yeah<00:03:38.109> that's<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.680> minimum<00:03:38.859> resolution

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:50.039 

settings<00:03:42.969> are<00:03:43.180> low<00:03:45.870> now<00:03:46.870> 90<00:03:47.859> plus<00:03:48.069> FPS<00:03:49.049> reach

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
settings are low now 90 plus FPS reach

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:57.550 
settings are low now 90 plus FPS reach
300<00:03:50.920> yep<00:03:52.590> so

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:11.670 

I<00:04:03.880> know<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:04.940> trial

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:27.480 

30<00:04:12.430> FPS<00:04:13.120> our<00:04:13.720> shit<00:04:23.250> good<00:04:24.870> good<00:04:25.870> FPS<00:04:26.050> but<00:04:26.949> it's

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
30 FPS our shit good good FPS but it's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.870 
30 FPS our shit good good FPS but it's
pretty<00:04:27.880> much<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.120> same<00:04:28.270> as<00:04:28.510> as<00:04:29.880> annihilation

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
pretty much the same as as annihilation

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.450 
pretty much the same as as annihilation
we<00:04:31.120> are<00:04:31.210> getting<00:04:31.479> 60fps<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.290> also<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:33.010> prefer

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
we are getting 60fps and also I prefer

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:47.790 
we are getting 60fps and also I prefer
higher<00:04:33.639> resolution<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.270> automatic<00:04:34.840> settings
