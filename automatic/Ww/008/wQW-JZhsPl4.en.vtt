00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
direction is going to be our tapered

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
direction is going to be our tapered
taper<00:00:53.520> down<00:00:53.699> where<00:00:54.270> our<00:00:54.360> fly<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.960> end

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
taper down where our fly is going to end

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.459 
taper down where our fly is going to end
up<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> grab<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.930> thick<00:00:58.230> end

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

can see that our knots all most done the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
can see that our knots all most done the
only<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.560> left<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.009> us<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.570> take

only thing left for us to do is to take
this<00:01:45.990> thick<00:01:46.530> butt<00:01:46.829> section<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.340> our<00:01:47.430> leader

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
this thick butt section of our leader

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
this thick butt section of our leader
and<00:01:48.030> slide<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.350> between<00:01:51.560> underneath<00:01:52.560> the

and slide it in between underneath the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
and slide it in between underneath the
loops<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> slide<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.600> along<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
loops so if you slide it right along the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.920 
loops so if you slide it right along the
edge<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:59.189> nail<00:01:59.430> where<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> nail<00:02:00.570> meets

your<00:02:01.530> fly<00:02:01.829> line<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:03.390> should<00:02:03.600> easily<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.960> able

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
your fly line you should easily be able

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.639 
your fly line you should easily be able
to<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> through<00:02:04.680> there<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:09.360> there

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to get it through there and there

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.920 
to get it through there and there
is<00:02:10.709> essentially<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> completed<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.450> at<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
is essentially I completed not at this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.100 
is essentially I completed not at this
point<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:13.799> all<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.129> have<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:15.239> slide<00:02:16.049> the

this a little bit to keep our knots our
wraps<00:02:25.079> oriented<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:28.170> we're<00:02:28.379> just<00:02:28.470> easing<00:02:28.920> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
wraps oriented and we're just easing it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.030 
wraps oriented and we're just easing it
down<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.819> nail<00:02:30.349> we're<00:02:31.349> almost<00:02:31.439> to<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.769> tip

down the nail we're almost to the tip

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.619 
down the nail we're almost to the tip
here<00:02:33.680> continue<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.769> pinch<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:36.299> when<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.510> hit

here continue to pinch and when you hit
the<00:02:36.750> taper<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.230> end<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.709> nail<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:39.000> can

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the taper to end of the nail you can

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.559 
the taper to end of the nail you can
start<00:02:39.390> applying<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.840> little<00:02:39.959> more<00:02:40.200> pressure<00:02:40.439> on

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
start applying a little more pressure on
