00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
was the one video game that I was just

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.689 
was the one video game that I was just
like<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.779> want<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> win<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.590> bad<00:00:25.890> because<00:00:26.369> of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.339 
like you want to win so bad because of
the<00:00:26.760> fatalities<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.199> what

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the fatalities and just to see what

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.169 
the fatalities and just to see what
they're<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.609> made<00:00:29.760> it
