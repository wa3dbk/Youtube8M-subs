00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.779 
so it sounds like a really neat one and
and<00:01:01.180> I<00:01:01.270> love<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.809> concept<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.760> breaking<00:01:03.760> down

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
and I love the concept of breaking down

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.109 
and I love the concept of breaking down
how<00:01:04.269> inexpensive<00:01:05.310> eating<00:01:06.310> healthy<00:01:07.000> and

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
how inexpensive eating healthy and

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.870 
how inexpensive eating healthy and
eating<00:01:07.270> vegan<00:01:07.600> can<00:01:08.080> be<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.830> in<00:01:09.070> her<00:01:09.369> book<00:01:09.400> it's

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
eating vegan can be and in her book it's

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.600 
eating vegan can be and in her book it's
all<00:01:10.150> broken<00:01:10.659> down<00:01:10.689> to<00:01:11.200> what<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.680> cost<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.250> per

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
all broken down to what the cost is per

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.910 
all broken down to what the cost is per
serving<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:14.110> sort<00:01:14.290> of<00:01:14.350> break<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.650> up<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.860> be

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
serving to sort of break it up to be

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.170 
serving to sort of break it up to be
four<00:01:15.130> dollars<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.430> day<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.700> think<00:01:16.060> that's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
four dollars a day and I think that's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.120 
four dollars a day and I think that's
really<00:01:16.330> important<00:01:16.840> because<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.320> can<00:01:17.860> be<00:01:17.890> a

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
really important because that can be a

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.219 
really important because that can be a
big<00:01:18.400> misconception<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:19.270> oh<00:01:19.420> if<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.720> you

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.020 
just gonna grease this with some coconut
oil<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:19.040> next<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.700> slice

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
oil so next I'm just going to slice

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.320 
oil so next I'm just going to slice
these<00:02:21.330> mushrooms<00:02:21.810> into<00:02:22.850> well<00:02:23.850> probably<00:02:24.090> about

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
these mushrooms into well probably about

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.570 
these mushrooms into well probably about
a<00:02:24.390> quarter<00:02:24.630> inch<00:02:24.930> thick<00:02:25.050> slices<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:26.370> gonna

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
a quarter inch thick slices I'm gonna

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.130 
a quarter inch thick slices I'm gonna
fry<00:02:26.850> them<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.600> little<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.960> water

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
fry them just with a little bit of water

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.590 
fry them just with a little bit of water
in<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.680> pan<00:02:29.070> over<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.880> I'm<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.510> gonna

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
in the pan over here and I'm just gonna

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.090 
in the pan over here and I'm just gonna
remove<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.110> stem<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:32.480> slice<00:02:33.480> them<00:02:33.720> about

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
remove the stem and slice them about

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.440 
remove the stem and slice them about
that<00:02:35.100> thick<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.880> part<00:02:36.090> isn't<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
that thick so this part isn't in the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.420 
that thick so this part isn't in the
recipe<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.840> actually<00:02:37.140> did<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.800> put<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> little

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
recipe I actually did just put a little

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.920 
recipe I actually did just put a little
bit<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.700> coconut<00:02:38.880> oil<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> pan<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.660> just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
bit of coconut oil on the pan I just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.170 
bit of coconut oil on the pan I just
want<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> make<00:02:40.260> sure<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.700> mushrooms

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
want to make sure that the mushrooms

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
want to make sure that the mushrooms
don't<00:02:42.360> stick<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.160> are<00:02:45.890> concerned

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
don't stick but if you are concerned

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.460 
don't stick but if you are concerned
about<00:02:47.160> fat<00:02:48.000> content<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.930> want<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.110> keep<00:02:49.260> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
about fat content you want to keep that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.620 
about fat content you want to keep that
down<00:02:49.740> then<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.640> 1<00:02:50.790> tablespoon<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.450> water

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
down then just the 1 tablespoon of water

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.450 
down then just the 1 tablespoon of water
should<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.020> enough<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.650> I'm<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.370> to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
should be enough and I'm just going to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.100 
should be enough and I'm just going to
put<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.120> pan<00:02:54.450> which<00:02:54.750> has<00:02:54.930> been

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
put these in the pan which has been

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.900 
put these in the pan which has been
heating<00:02:55.380> up<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.100> we're<00:02:56.490> just<00:02:56.550> gonna<00:02:56.670> cook

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
heating up and we're just gonna cook

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.260 
heating up and we're just gonna cook
this<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:57.270> about<00:02:57.390> 6<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.930> 8<00:02:57.960> minutes<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:59.520> we'll

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
this for about 6 to 8 minutes and we'll

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.970 
this for about 6 to 8 minutes and we'll
probably<00:03:00.720> another<00:03:01.110> one<00:03:01.500> or<00:03:01.620> two<00:03:01.650> tablespoons

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
probably another one or two tablespoons

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.880 
probably another one or two tablespoons
of<00:03:02.790> water<00:03:03.240> as<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:04.110> water<00:03:04.380> starts<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
of water as that water starts to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.680 
of water as that water starts to
evaporate<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.430> probably<00:03:06.000> cooked<00:03:06.300> enough

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
evaporate it's probably cooked enough

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.680 
evaporate it's probably cooked enough
for<00:03:07.200> what<00:03:07.500> Martha<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.459> we<00:03:09.420> actually

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
for what Martha and I like we actually

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.630 
for what Martha and I like we actually
didn't<00:03:09.990> need<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.350> third<00:03:10.650> tablespoon<00:03:11.550> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
didn't need the third tablespoon of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.840 
didn't need the third tablespoon of
water<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.570> we're<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.170> set<00:03:13.850> that

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
water so we're just going to set that

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.540 
water so we're just going to set that
aside<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> bowl<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.500> next<00:03:16.800> step<00:03:17.130> involves

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
aside in the bowl the next step involves

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.479 
aside in the bowl the next step involves
our<00:03:17.910> food<00:03:18.270> processor<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.110> we<00:03:19.950> are<00:03:20.070> going<00:03:20.340> to

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
our food processor and we are going to

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.180 
our food processor and we are going to
take<00:03:20.730> what's<00:03:21.420> left<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.989> water<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
take what's left of the water the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.370 
take what's left of the water the
garbanzo<00:03:23.760> beans<00:03:24.209> or<00:03:24.480> chickpeas<00:03:24.720> as<00:03:25.170> they're

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
garbanzo beans or chickpeas as they're

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.320 
garbanzo beans or chickpeas as they're
probably<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.310> commonly<00:03:26.790> referred<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.180> as

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
probably more commonly referred to as

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.910 
probably more commonly referred to as
and<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> oats<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.200> we're<00:03:28.290> gonna<00:03:28.380> blend<00:03:28.680> them

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and the oats and we're gonna blend them

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.850 
and the oats and we're gonna blend them
in<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.580> food<00:03:29.700> processor<00:03:29.840> until<00:03:30.840> smooth<00:03:31.230> just

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
in the food processor until smooth just

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.570 
in the food processor until smooth just
a<00:03:31.980> side<00:03:32.400> note<00:03:32.870> these<00:03:34.130> garbanzo<00:03:35.130> beans<00:03:35.340> or

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
a side note these garbanzo beans or

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.290 
a side note these garbanzo beans or
chickpeas<00:03:35.760> were<00:03:36.600> actually<00:03:37.220> dried<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.610> so

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
chickpeas were actually dried and so

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.080 
chickpeas were actually dried and so
that<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.660> another<00:03:39.930> cost-effective<00:03:40.890> way<00:03:41.130> as

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that is another cost-effective way as

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.750 
that is another cost-effective way as
opposed<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.570> buying<00:03:43.200> canned<00:03:43.830> beans<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.670> you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
opposed to buying canned beans if you

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.850 
opposed to buying canned beans if you
buy<00:03:44.970> them<00:03:45.209> dried<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.440> buy<00:03:46.560> them<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.770> bulk

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
buy them dried you can buy them in bulk

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.190 
buy them dried you can buy them in bulk
and<00:03:47.310> get<00:03:47.430> them<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.640> lot<00:03:47.820> cheaper<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.450> then<00:03:49.050> you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
and get them a lot cheaper and then you

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.130 
and get them a lot cheaper and then you
soak<00:03:49.500> them<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:49.980> then<00:03:50.400> cook<00:03:50.940> them<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.480> that's

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
soak them and then cook them and that's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.510 
soak them and then cook them and that's
actually<00:03:52.590> something<00:03:52.800> that<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.100> think<00:03:53.280> we<00:03:53.370> did

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
actually something that I think we did

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.210 
actually something that I think we did
arrest<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.910> or<00:03:54.030> an<00:03:54.810> episode<00:03:55.110> on<00:03:55.290> not<00:03:55.890> too<00:03:56.070> long

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
arrest it or an episode on not too long

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.340 
arrest it or an episode on not too long
ago<00:03:56.280> or<00:03:56.760> might<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.450> while<00:03:57.750> ago<00:03:57.959> now<00:03:57.989> but<00:03:58.230> we'll

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
ago or might a while ago now but we'll

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.380 
ago or might a while ago now but we'll
post<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.709> link<00:03:58.739> for<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.130> because<00:03:59.910> that's<00:04:00.150> a

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
post a link for that because that's a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
post a link for that because that's a
great<00:04:00.720> way<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.709> save<00:04:01.890> money<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.340> make<00:04:02.400> sure

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
great way to to save money and make sure

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.920 
great way to to save money and make sure
that<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.840> afford<00:04:04.140> organic<00:04:05.690> beans<00:04:06.690> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
that you can afford organic beans and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.089 
that you can afford organic beans and
peas

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.340 

it's<00:04:14.099> almost<00:04:14.549> smooth<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.390> that's<00:04:15.510> probably

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
it's almost smooth and that's probably

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
peas in there here we've got our

peas in there here we've got our
sun-dried<00:04:48.360> tomatoes<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.350> these<00:04:50.340> were

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
sun-dried tomatoes and these were

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.219 
sun-dried tomatoes and these were
actually<00:04:50.789> soaked<00:04:51.180> in<00:04:51.449> water<00:04:51.630> for<00:04:52.020> an<00:04:52.110> hour

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
actually soaked in water for an hour

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.150 
actually soaked in water for an hour
just<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:53.010> way<00:04:53.190> it's<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:53.910> lot<00:04:54.780> yeah<00:04:55.590> exactly

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
just so that way it's a lot yeah exactly

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.040 
just so that way it's a lot yeah exactly
so<00:04:56.669> I've<00:04:56.760> cut<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.270> up<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.750> was<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> lot

so I've cut that up and that was a lot

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.689 
so I've cut that up and that was a lot
easier<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.500> cut<00:04:58.680> because<00:04:58.889> those<00:04:59.190> were<00:04:59.400> soaked

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
easier to cut because those were soaked

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.029 
easier to cut because those were soaked
