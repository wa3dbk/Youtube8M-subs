00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
like the fact that you have cloud and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.520 
like the fact that you have cloud and
device<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.270> may<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> apps<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> cloud

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
device so you may have apps on the cloud

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.380 
device so you may have apps on the cloud
that<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.830> don't<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.460> device<00:02:44.730> you

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.400 
device I do like the silk browser I
think<00:04:42.669> it's<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.940> little<00:04:43.180> quicker<00:04:43.449> than<00:04:43.810> regular

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.689 
Internet Explorer on Windows Phone it's
faster<00:04:49.720> than<00:04:49.840> your<00:04:49.990> regular<00:04:50.199> AOSP<00:04:51.039> internet
