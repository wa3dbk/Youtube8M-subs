we've definitely focused on the weapons

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.130 
we've definitely focused on the weapons
once<00:00:47.040> again<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.580> terms<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.270> making<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.750> very

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
once again in terms of making them very

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
once again in terms of making them very
different<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.860> resistance<00:00:50.310> to<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.210> also

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
different for resistance to but we also

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.480 
different for resistance to but we also
bought<00:00:51.660> brought<00:00:52.020> back<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.950> our<00:00:53.070> favorite

fall of man we got a lot of questions
about<00:01:27.970> why<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.390> didn't<00:01:28.900> include<00:01:29.170> online<00:01:29.710> co-op

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
about why we didn't include online co-op

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.370 
about why we didn't include online co-op
in<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.520> game<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.210> we<00:01:31.360> took<00:01:31.480> those<00:01:31.690> too<00:01:32.140> hard

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
in the game and we took those too hard

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.050 
in the game and we took those too hard
we<00:01:32.620> realized<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:33.100> people<00:01:33.280> really<00:01:33.580> wanted<00:01:33.940> to

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
we realized that people really wanted to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.330 
we realized that people really wanted to
see<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:35.410> knew<00:01:35.620> from<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> very

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
see that so we knew from the very

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.440 
see that so we knew from the very
beginning<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:37.030> were<00:01:37.150> going<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.300> do

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
beginning that we were going to do

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.170 
beginning that we were going to do
online<00:01:37.690> co-op<00:01:38.020> but<00:01:38.680> what<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:39.040> didn't<00:01:39.670> know<00:01:39.880> was

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
online co-op but what we didn't know was

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180 
online co-op but what we didn't know was
how<00:01:40.450> far<00:01:40.780> we<00:01:40.930> would<00:01:41.050> take<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:41.680> we<00:01:41.860> started

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
how far we would take it so we started

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.160 
how far we would take it so we started
throwing<00:01:42.610> ideas<00:01:42.730> out<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.390> eventually<00:01:43.870> we

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
throwing ideas out and eventually we

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.660 
throwing ideas out and eventually we
decided<00:01:44.260> okay<00:01:44.650> screw<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.010> we're<00:01:45.490> going<00:01:45.610> to

decided okay screw it we're going to

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.550 
decided okay screw it we're going to
take<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.420> bar<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.630> lot<00:01:46.870> further<00:01:47.050> than<00:01:47.230> people

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.550 
the encounter and also scale the health
of<00:01:57.250> our<00:01:57.370> advanced<00:01:57.850> enemies<00:01:58.180> based<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:58.720> how

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
of our advanced enemies based on how

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.050 
of our advanced enemies based on how
many<00:01:59.620> people<00:01:59.800> are<00:02:00.160> in<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.340> group<00:02:00.550> so<00:02:00.970> you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
many people are in the group so you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.000 
many people are in the group so you
really<00:02:01.450> can<00:02:01.690> play<00:02:01.990> as<00:02:02.170> small<00:02:02.470> as<00:02:02.650> two<00:02:02.800> people

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
really can play as small as two people

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.830 
really can play as small as two people
it's<00:02:03.280> much<00:02:03.640> more<00:02:03.820> strategic<00:02:04.030> at<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.600> point

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
it's much more strategic at that point

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.040 
it's much more strategic at that point
because<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:05.440> two<00:02:05.680> verses<00:02:06.130> these<00:02:06.280> very<00:02:06.790> large

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
because it's two verses these very large

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.540 
because it's two verses these very large
adversaries<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.170> these<00:02:08.500> very<00:02:08.710> large<00:02:08.770> scale

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
adversaries and these very large scale

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.370 
adversaries and these very large scale
encounters<00:02:10.210> but<00:02:10.570> at<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.720> same<00:02:10.869> time<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.200> is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
encounters but at the same time it is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.290 
encounters but at the same time it is
doable<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:12.190> takes<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.400> lot<00:02:12.640> more<00:02:12.670> strategy

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
doable just takes a lot more strategy

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.090 
doable just takes a lot more strategy
and<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> lot<00:02:13.540> more<00:02:13.570> patience<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.530> key<00:02:14.800> for<00:02:15.010> our

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and a lot more patience it's key for our

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.500 
and a lot more patience it's key for our
replayability<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.910> also<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.240> promote

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
replayability and also to promote

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.570 
replayability and also to promote
teamwork<00:02:16.870> organically<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.920> three<00:02:18.310> very

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
teamwork organically to have three very

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580 
teamwork organically to have three very
distinct<00:02:19.090> classes<00:02:19.330> they<00:02:19.989> each<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.380> very

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
distinct classes they each have very

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.920 
distinct classes they each have very
distinct<00:02:21.280> roles<00:02:21.459> as<00:02:21.700> well<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.390> soldiers<00:02:22.780> are

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
distinct roles as well the soldiers are

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.930

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
he has more health in the other classes

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.000 
he has more health in the other classes
and<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.630> provided<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> shield<00:02:29.020> he<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.530> use<00:02:29.739> to

less health in the other classes I mean

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.860 
less health in the other classes I mean
the<00:02:38.500> medic<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.920> course<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.430> our<00:02:39.940> primary

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the medic of course is our primary

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.350 
the medic of course is our primary
support<00:02:41.350> class<00:02:41.620> he's<00:02:42.160> really<00:02:42.459> his<00:02:42.880> place<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
support class he's really his place that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.850 
support class he's really his place that
I<00:02:43.390> was<00:02:43.540> different<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.959> again<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.590> promote

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
I was different and again to promote

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.560 
I was different and again to promote
replayability<00:02:45.459> but<00:02:45.940> he<00:02:46.060> focuses<00:02:46.450> primarily

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
replayability but he focuses primarily

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.030 
replayability but he focuses primarily
on<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.080> group

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.100 

well<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> 60<00:02:51.060> player<00:02:51.209> multiplayer<00:02:51.390> was<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
well the 60 player multiplayer was a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.720 
well the 60 player multiplayer was a
challenge<00:02:52.799> for<00:02:52.890> us<00:02:52.980> again<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> design

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
challenge for us again on the design

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.970 
challenge for us again on the design
side<00:02:53.760> because<00:02:54.329> we<00:02:54.480> knew<00:02:54.719> that<00:02:54.989> if<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:55.590> were<00:02:55.829> to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
side because we knew that if we were to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.069 
side because we knew that if we were to
move<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.340> numbers<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.060> high<00:02:57.269> we<00:02:57.900> would

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
move the numbers of that high we would

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.610 
move the numbers of that high we would
be<00:02:58.170> dealing<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.620> unmitigated<00:02:59.549> chaos<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.930> we

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
be dealing with unmitigated chaos so we

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.679 
be dealing with unmitigated chaos so we
took<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.459> step<00:03:02.670> back<00:03:02.879> and<00:03:02.909> we<00:03:03.180> said<00:03:03.359> we<00:03:03.510> asked

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
took a step back and we said we asked

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.690 
took a step back and we said we asked
ourselves<00:03:03.780> what<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.319> we<00:03:04.439> do<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.890> create<00:03:05.400> order

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
ourselves what can we do to create order

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.069 
ourselves what can we do to create order
out<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.939> this<00:03:06.030> chaos<00:03:06.269> what<00:03:06.540> we<00:03:06.689> do<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> have

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
out of this chaos what we do to have

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.679 
out of this chaos what we do to have
massive<00:03:07.829> battles<00:03:08.189> more<00:03:08.459> intimacy<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:09.569> we

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
massive battles more intimacy so we

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.589 
massive battles more intimacy so we
split<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.590> 60<00:03:10.920> players<00:03:11.099> into<00:03:11.700> squads<00:03:12.420> of

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
split the the 60 players into squads of

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.899 
split the the 60 players into squads of
five<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.260> again<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:14.069> just<00:03:14.549> gets<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.790> kind

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
five and again that just gets you kind

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:15.949 
five and again that just gets you kind
of<00:03:15.030> working<00:03:15.269> together<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.599> little<00:03:15.689> bit<00:03:15.840> better

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
of working together a little bit better

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.229 
of working together a little bit better
it<00:03:16.769> also<00:03:16.889> lets<00:03:17.129> us<00:03:17.370> kind<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.730> coordinate<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
it also lets us kind of coordinate the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.819 
it also lets us kind of coordinate the
battles<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> little<00:03:18.720> bit<00:03:18.840> more<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.019> then<00:03:19.739> we

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
battles a little bit more and then we

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.129 
battles a little bit more and then we
use<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.099> objectives<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:21.359> assign<00:03:21.629> one<00:03:21.840> squad

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
use the objectives we assign one squad

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.809 
use the objectives we assign one squad
objective<00:03:22.739> well<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> couple<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.609> squats

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
objective well a couple of squats

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.309 
objective well a couple of squats
sometimes<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.389> get<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> battle<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.930> ramped

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
sometimes to get the battle like ramped

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.369 
sometimes to get the battle like ramped
up<00:03:25.409> but<00:03:26.099> uh<00:03:26.359> we<00:03:27.359> assign<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:27.720> an<00:03:27.810> objective<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
up but uh we assign you an objective to

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.379 
up but uh we assign you an objective to
basically<00:03:28.680> get<00:03:28.859> your<00:03:29.010> whole<00:03:29.129> squad<00:03:29.459> get<00:03:30.269> their

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
basically get your whole squad get their

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.759 
basically get your whole squad get their
guns<00:03:30.419> point<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.989> same<00:03:31.109> direction<00:03:31.169> get

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
guns point in the same direction get

weatherization<00:04:07.470> diffusion<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.459> us<00:04:08.549> has<00:04:08.699> been

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
weatherization diffusion for us has been

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.360 
weatherization diffusion for us has been
a<00:04:08.879> really<00:04:09.120> important<00:04:09.739> piece<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.799> technology

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
a really important piece of technology

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.979 
a really important piece of technology
that<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:11.639> adopted<00:04:12.180> during<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.629> development

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
that we adopted during the development

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.559 
that we adopted during the development
of<00:04:13.079> resistance<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.069> in<00:04:14.250> fact<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:15.150> enabled

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
of resistance to and in fact it enabled

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.089 
of resistance to and in fact it enabled
us<00:04:15.659> to<00:04:15.720> get<00:04:15.959> pigeons<00:04:16.289> into<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> game<00:04:16.709> because

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
us to get pigeons into the game because

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.099 
us to get pigeons into the game because
pigeons<00:04:17.549> are<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.699> very<00:04:18.030> important<00:04:18.570> part<00:04:18.810> of

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
pigeons are a very important part of

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.050 
pigeons are a very important part of
resistance<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.039> there<00:04:20.250> are<00:04:20.310> AI<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.669> so

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
resistance and there are AI is so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.560 
resistance and there are AI is so
complex<00:04:21.659> that<00:04:21.989> we<00:04:22.380> have<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.830> use<00:04:23.039> these

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
complex that we have to use these

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.240 
complex that we have to use these
specialized<00:04:24.570> techniques<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:25.949> we<00:04:26.130> can

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
specialized techniques so that we can

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.379 
specialized techniques so that we can
have<00:04:26.400> flocks<00:04:26.639> of<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> moving<00:04:27.120> around<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
have flocks of the moving around the

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.120 
have flocks of the moving around the
game<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.780> think<00:04:28.229> resistance<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.710> has<00:04:28.860> more<00:04:29.039> to

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
game I think resistance to has more to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.620 
game I think resistance to has more to
offer<00:04:29.159> than<00:04:29.400> any<00:04:29.610> shooter<00:04:29.909> out<00:04:29.940> there<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.449> it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
offer than any shooter out there and it

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.899 
offer than any shooter out there and it
is<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> super<00:04:31.590> high<00:04:31.650> quality<00:04:31.680> game<00:04:32.250> it's<00:04:32.729> going

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
is a super high quality game it's going

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.420 
is a super high quality game it's going
to<00:04:32.940> give<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.570> lot<00:04:34.139> of<00:04:34.380> game<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:35.130> your<00:04:35.250> money

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
to give you a lot of game for your money
