know if it'll stay up but if it doesn't
is<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.910> usually<00:01:00.090> happened<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
is because what usually happened is the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
is because what usually happened is the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
something with that the starter motor

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
something with that the starter motor
when<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> press<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> starter<00:01:46.920> button<00:01:47.130> sounds

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
when you press the starter button sounds

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
when you press the starter button sounds
a<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.820> dry<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.570> suspect<00:01:49.229> those<00:01:49.380> guys<00:01:49.560> been<00:01:49.740> left

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
a bit dry I suspect those guys been left

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.440 
a bit dry I suspect those guys been left
standing<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> keep<00:01:51.000> using<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
standing I think if you keep using the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.069 
standing I think if you keep using the
bike<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> may<00:01:52.049> well<00:01:52.549> sort<00:01:53.549> itself<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.420> may

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
bike it may well sort itself out you may

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
bike it may well sort itself out you may
also<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.070> would<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.250> easier<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.610> squirt

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
also think it would be easier to squirt

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
also think it would be easier to squirt
some<00:01:56.909> oil<00:01:57.450> onto<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.899> onto<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> pinion

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
some oil onto the onto the pinion

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.600 
some oil onto the onto the pinion
bearing<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> felt<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.610> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.220 

there's<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.820> couple<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.150> cable<00:02:04.570> ties<00:02:04.810> around

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
there's a couple of cable ties around

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.390 
there's a couple of cable ties around
the<00:02:05.290> bike<00:02:05.500> as<00:02:05.680> well<00:02:05.710> they're<00:02:06.010> holding<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
the bike as well they're holding the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.219 
the bike as well they're holding the
panels<00:02:06.790> on<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.090> guess<00:02:07.360> some<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
panels on so I guess some of the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.680 
panels on so I guess some of the
fittings<00:02:08.649> have<00:02:08.830> gotten<00:02:09.340> tired<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:10.450> them

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
fittings have gotten tired with them

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.690 
fittings have gotten tired with them
taking<00:02:11.050> them<00:02:11.230> off<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> guess<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.640> a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
taking them off and on I guess it's a

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.060 
taking them off and on I guess it's a
couple<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.000> those<00:02:13.120> I've<00:02:13.330> noticed<00:02:14.070> but

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
couple of those I've noticed but

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.710 
couple of those I've noticed but
basically<00:02:15.400> that's<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.850> he<00:02:15.970> does<00:02:16.120> start<00:02:16.450> up<00:02:16.570> he

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
basically that's it he does start up he

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.270 
basically that's it he does start up he
does<00:02:16.900> run<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.320> seems<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.620> ride<00:02:17.830> well<00:02:18.040> enough

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
does run it seems to ride well enough

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.940 
does run it seems to ride well enough
the<00:02:18.940> engine<00:02:19.209> sounds<00:02:19.600> fine<00:02:19.840> doesn't<00:02:20.380> smoke<00:02:20.740> or

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
the engine sounds fine doesn't smoke or

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.280 
the engine sounds fine doesn't smoke or
anything<00:02:21.130> like<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.690> lamp<00:02:22.690> system<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.200> it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
anything like that lamp system on it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.750 
anything like that lamp system on it
which<00:02:23.410> seems<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.680> work<00:02:23.980> I'm<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.520> quite<00:02:24.730> sure

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
which seems to work I'm not quite sure

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.340 
which seems to work I'm not quite sure
how<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.209> worked<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:25.540> by<00:02:25.810> pressing<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> bar

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
how it worked but by pressing the bar

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.530 
how it worked but by pressing the bar
you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> trying<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.420> what

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
you can see that it is trying to do what

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.570 
you can see that it is trying to do what
it's<00:02:28.660> supposed<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:29.020> do<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.800> anyway<00:02:30.160> there<00:02:30.490> we

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's supposed to do so anyway there we

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.900 
it's supposed to do so anyway there we
go

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
go

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.780 
go
good<00:02:31.300> luck<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.630> bidding
