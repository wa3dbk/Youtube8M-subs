natural<00:02:22.220> blush<00:02:22.910> going<00:02:23.570> on<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.710> did<00:02:25.100> kind<00:02:25.430> of

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
natural blush going on so I did kind of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.760 
natural blush going on so I did kind of

just<00:02:28.100> pop<00:02:28.310> just<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.850> teeny<00:02:29.120> bit<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:30.260> I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
just pop just a teeny bit and then I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.120 
just pop just a teeny bit and then I
move<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.170> think<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.620> move<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.010> his

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
move on to I think I move on to his

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.360 
move on to I think I move on to his
necklace<00:02:34.400> he<00:02:35.210> has<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.780> signature<00:02:36.110> key<00:02:36.950> not

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
necklace he has that signature key not

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.600 
necklace he has that signature key not
key<00:02:37.780> crown<00:02:38.780> necklace<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.160> couldn't<00:02:40.400> find

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
key crown necklace and I couldn't find

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.940 
key crown necklace and I couldn't find
it<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.270> just<00:02:41.390> improvised<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.470> then<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.590> ended

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
it so I just improvised and then I ended

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.250 
it so I just improvised and then I ended
up<00:02:43.100> picking<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.330> went<00:02:44.540> back<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
up picking this but then I went back to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.980 
up picking this but then I went back to
using<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:46.030> Triforce<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.360> because<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.720> think

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
using the Triforce one because I think

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.470 
using the Triforce one because I think
it<00:02:48.110> looks<00:02:48.290> more<00:02:48.860> like<00:02:49.370> something<00:02:49.700> Sora<00:02:50.180> would

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
it looks more like something Sora would

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.200 
it looks more like something Sora would
wear<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.830> fixing<00:02:52.220> up<00:02:52.310> his<00:02:52.520> face<00:02:52.820> because

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
wear so just fixing up his face because

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.330 
wear so just fixing up his face because
