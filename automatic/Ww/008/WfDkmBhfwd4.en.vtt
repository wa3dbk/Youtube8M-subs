these natural beauties the first wave

chairman<00:00:51.720> I'm<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.500> Baja<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> famous<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
chairman I'm in Baja at a famous way of

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.970 
chairman I'm in Baja at a famous way of
called<00:00:54.000> San<00:00:54.239> Miguel<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.470> this<00:00:55.559> place<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
called San Miguel and when this place is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
called San Miguel and when this place is
on<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.940> definitely<00:00:57.360> hold<00:00:57.600> your

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
on it will definitely hold your

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:08.930 
on it will definitely hold your
attention

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:38.900 

you

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.370 

one<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.060> reasons<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.840> wave<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.110> so

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
one of the reasons that this wave is so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.660 
one of the reasons that this wave is so
good<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.710> because<00:01:41.740> there's<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.160> watershed

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
good is because there's a watershed

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.790 
good is because there's a watershed
right<00:01:43.240> behind<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.140> right<00:01:44.470> now<00:01:44.560> I'm<00:01:44.680> gonna

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
right behind it and right now I'm gonna

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.010 
right behind it and right now I'm gonna
go<00:01:44.920> talk<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.190> an<00:01:45.460> expert<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.090> learn<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> little

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
go talk to an expert and learn a little

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.820 
go talk to an expert and learn a little
bit<00:01:47.140> about<00:01:47.410> why<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:48.010> is<00:01:48.250> really<00:01:48.670> important

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
bit about why that is really important

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.920 
bit about why that is really important
so<00:01:50.830> watershed<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.610> basically<00:01:52.120> like<00:01:52.330> an<00:01:52.540> area

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
so watershed is basically like an area

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.470 
so watershed is basically like an area
of<00:01:52.990> land<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.620> all<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.460> water<00:01:54.640> drains<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.180> one

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
of land that all the water drains to one

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.420 
of land that all the water drains to one
singular<00:01:55.900> point<00:01:56.290> as<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.950> can<00:01:57.070> see<00:01:57.280> up<00:01:57.400> here

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
singular point as you can see up here

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.000 
singular point as you can see up here
looking<00:01:57.940> up<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> watershed<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.840> samuele<00:01:59.440> it's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
looking up the watershed of samuele it's

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.800 
looking up the watershed of samuele it's
really<00:02:00.310> really<00:02:00.670> green<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.540> pretty

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
really really green and this is pretty

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.360 
really really green and this is pretty
important<00:02:02.260> because<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.830> essentially

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
important because this is essentially

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.550 
important because this is essentially
like<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.580> desert<00:02:03.910> landscape<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.260> can<00:02:05.380> look

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
like a desert landscape so you can look

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.170 
like a desert landscape so you can look
there's<00:02:05.770> all<00:02:05.890> kinds<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.250> willows<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.729> other

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
there's all kinds of willows and other

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.230 
there's all kinds of willows and other
important<00:02:07.840> trees<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.700> really<00:02:09.880> provides

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
important trees and this really provides

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.910 
important trees and this really provides
a<00:02:10.360> lot<00:02:10.540> of<00:02:10.660> habitat<00:02:11.140> for<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> things<00:02:11.709> that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
a lot of habitat for the things that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.949 
a lot of habitat for the things that
live<00:02:12.070> here<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.209> know<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> variety<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.750> bird

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
live here so you know a variety of bird

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.220 
live here so you know a variety of bird
species<00:02:14.370> foxes<00:02:15.370> deer<00:02:16.030> or<00:02:16.150> whatever<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.750> all

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
species foxes deer or whatever it is all

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.920 
species foxes deer or whatever it is all
really<00:02:17.560> depend<00:02:18.070> on<00:02:18.570> ecosystems<00:02:19.570> like<00:02:19.630> this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
really depend on ecosystems like this

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.960 
really depend on ecosystems like this
because<00:02:20.470> all<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.550> place<00:02:21.730> where<00:02:21.760> all

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
because all this is a place where all

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.430 
because all this is a place where all
the<00:02:22.090> water<00:02:22.240> flows<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:22.990> then<00:02:23.290> there's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the water flows to and then there's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.449 
the water flows to and then there's
going<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.740> bunch<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> plants<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.370> them

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
going to be a bunch of plants for them

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.270 
going to be a bunch of plants for them

he's<00:02:37.959> also<00:02:38.170> my<00:02:38.410> neighbor<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.820> think

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
he's also my neighbor so if you think

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.910 
he's also my neighbor so if you think
about<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.300> place<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.900> trestles<00:02:41.410> right<00:02:41.739> that's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
about a place like trestles right that's

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.300 
about a place like trestles right that's
a<00:02:42.010> classic<00:02:42.400> wave<00:02:42.790> classic<00:02:43.690> Kabul<00:02:44.110> break<00:02:45.040> and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
a classic wave classic Kabul break and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.520 
a classic wave classic Kabul break and
that<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:46.000> dependent<00:02:46.540> again<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.050> watershed

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
that is dependent again on the watershed

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.560 
that is dependent again on the watershed
there<00:02:47.800> right<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.250> trestles<00:02:48.640> which<00:02:48.880> brings

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
there right at trestles which brings

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.960 
there right at trestles which brings
those<00:02:49.870> big<00:02:50.170> cobbles<00:02:50.650> down<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.580> that's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
those big cobbles down and so that's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.610 
those big cobbles down and so that's
where<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.360> get<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.600> shape<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> wave<00:02:53.410> so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
where you get that shape of the wave so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.229 
where you get that shape of the wave so
it's<00:02:53.739> really<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:54.250> important<00:02:54.610> as<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> surfer

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
it's really really important as a surfer

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.930 
it's really really important as a surfer
to<00:02:55.930> know<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.560> function<00:02:57.070> it's<00:02:57.430> also<00:02:57.670> really

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
to know that function it's also really

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.360 
to know that function it's also really
important<00:02:58.330> because<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.840> rains<00:02:59.380> anything

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370

that happens on the land out here will

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500 
that happens on the land out here will
end<00:03:02.680> up<00:03:02.920> in<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.280> waves<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.850> any<00:03:04.120> sort<00:03:04.450> of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
end up in the waves so any sort of

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.660 
end up in the waves so any sort of
contaminants<00:03:05.170> or<00:03:05.260> pollutants<00:03:05.769> will<00:03:06.400> be
