00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 welcome to vt a summary that will be deposited 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.580
 stream of news technologies 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.859
 most interesting of the last week 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.260
 I come from partying I have a lot of news and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.000
 this week has been a constant stress 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.000
 so go ahead 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.029
 apple has introduced two new phones 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.119
 iphone 6 and postcard and iphone 6 plus 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.400
 will have a retina screen of 47 and 5.5 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.030
 inches almost like samsung nfs module 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.950
 for the app and you can record at 240 frames 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 per second the camera but it's still 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.640
 of 8 megapixels we will have the version of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.030
 128 gb which clamps 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 so hard is to put a damn slot 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.000
 for a sd card and the price will start 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.790
 in 199 dollars that will surely be 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 also in euros the version of 4.7 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.940
 inches and that of 5.5 will be one hundred euros 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 more every that with clear contract also 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.980
 to present it but rectangular watch 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.700
 like the other watches little originality 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.680
 of this metal and has a few 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.570
 finished I think there are six a lot of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.390
 straps and a lot of sensors to be 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.920
 monitoring of all types of sports 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.500
 but above all, cycling 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.680
 there will be three versions that I call them 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.960
 Normal esports and premium will start at 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.600
 sell at the beginning of 2015 and its price 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.630
 it will be 249 dollars that surely 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.119
 they are 249 euros the cheapest version 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.310
 and from what I 've read in the past 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.409
 rumors the most expensive version could 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.010
 reach 1200 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.480
 the one bathed in gold and all those bites 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.890
 I do not know I do not know I think they're going down 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.750
 this ipe the lapse seems to be 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.960
 getting fashionable because it's an effect 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.180
 pretty cool and in less than two months 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.820
 microsoft instagram have presented their 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.070
 solutions to make that kind of videos 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.320
 in the mobile well now it seems that 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.660
 it's the turn of other cameras a little more 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.550
 big especially the digital and go 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.200
 pro this week a page has appeared 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.420
 web that was not being done 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.630
 promotion of a gadget calls you 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.210
 and xp astérix for what it promises is to 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.820
 through a magic process stabilize 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.650
 the videos that we record with the cameras 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.030
 digital as I said before what 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.490
 only thing that is known is that the creators 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.490
 have in mind to make a campaign of 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.820
 massive funding so we will be 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.560
 waiting and watching you according to a 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.480
 study conducted with an employee of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.150
 kaspersky lab our appliances 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.010
 smart as they are easily 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.050
 talk so those people who want 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.120
 access your nude photos through 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.670
 the fridge 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.700
 they can easily do it, I can not stand it 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.709
 you know what brands are vulnerable and 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.629
 the signals of kaspersky do not think 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.450
 publish the list of household effects 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.269
 with those security flaws it 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.690
 You would be careful not to keep yours 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.090
 naked photos in the mobile saved in 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.519
 a hard drive this from the little ones 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.129
 drones that you can find there with a 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.170
 command is becoming more and more and 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.819
 most popular several months ago it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.310
 they presented two that could be followed in 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.739
 third person automatically a 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.230
 pretty interesting concept well 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.989
 three of robotics has presented its own 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.790
 drone that can record you in third 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.069
 person the main characteristic that 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.739
 think to use to compete against those 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.620
 two first drones that could record you 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.590
 like gta is the price the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.359
 base model will cost 750 dollars but 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.659
 logically if you are adding little things 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:42.720
 then the city will cost a lot but 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.730
 it's still a way to get into 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 the market and find a kind of 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.360
 user that maybe this type is cool 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.400
 of things 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.310
 it can be controlled through a command 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.960
 phone or even the pp of the watch a 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.570
 of the curiosities this week is 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.220
 that michael toler has presented a 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.930
 robotic worm that is capable of 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.610
 survive all kinds of situations 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.760
 tricky that can be presented 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.640
 as for example the flames of fire 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.440
 about going to extreme temperatures more 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.510
 extreme of 10 below zero 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.490
 more or less extreme not so much be 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.230
 crushed by a car a project 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.269
 quite interesting that surely 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.890
 will use in all kinds of rescues and 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.310
 It also leaves us closer to the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.460
 terminator 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.389
 I do not think it's very good news 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.090
 short and pp 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.680
 General Motors has said that for 2017 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.360
 we will have autonomous cars will not be 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.669
 100% freelancers but they can be 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.509
 use in traffic jams and on highways 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.599
 next anti cut recorder 24 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:49.870
 terabytes of mega active memory is a 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:53.259
 gadget that allows you for 5 thousand 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.460
 dollars record a video channel during 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:59.529
 Age 24 terabytes a huge amount 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.509
 Microsoft wants you to play its games 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.219
 through the browser the title is 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.750
 pretty explanatory using the 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.189
 process technology in the cloud 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.460
 Microsoft is testing 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.009
 Precisely that is to put games on the xbox 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.569
 in the browser if two weeks ago 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.310
 still had a hard drive of 80 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:21.900
 this week or this visit has been 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.900
 presented damn bug fly 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.100
 if it is two weeks 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.190
 so I have presented your hard drives 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.060
 of 8 hours this week of 37 ha 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.650
 represented his 6 8 hard drives and 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.120
 10 back 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.480
 how you stay are neither date nor price nor 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.730
 availability or nothing at all is 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.900
 will sell to companies and instead of 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.190
 use air they use helium that seems 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.590
 that allows them to reach some 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.410
 this higher 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.050
 shows that the hard disk drives ssd other 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.050
 solid state are not always a 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.540
 solution sometimes you need size much 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.940
 size to save a lot of movies 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.220
 music and online 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.460
 gta 5 leaves for pc yes 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.840
 in november i am groot in november 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.120
 will go for pc 4 and xbox money and then 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.310
 soon it is not known when there is no 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.310
 exact date but it will also come out for pc 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.470
 gta 5 there are a number of improvements 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.350
 incredible but all in the section 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.500
 visual maybe some bugs are solved 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.010
 as it always does but 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.889
 I will be waiting impatiently because 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:51.430
 GTA 5 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:53.830
 I kick you in the ass and that's it 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.470
 he has barely had time this week to 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.250
 go preparing the news so I have 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:04.720
 been short and is what there is sometimes the 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:07.520
 life plays you dirty tricks way one 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.039
 bad luck is pretty 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.819
 but the usual if you like to give 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:15.740
 I like it if you do not like it I do not like it 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:18.819
 write because you do not like and 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.560
 subscribe to my channel see you inside 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:24.740
 in theories seven days but it will be less 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:29.440
 because between I upload the montillas 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.440
 said goodbye delays
