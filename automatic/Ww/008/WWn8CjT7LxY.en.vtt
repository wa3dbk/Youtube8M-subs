00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
how it kind of holds that wave up there

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.809 
how it kind of holds that wave up there
nice<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.810> firmly<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.459> let<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.610> stay

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
nice and firmly and I can let it stay

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.460 
nice and firmly and I can let it stay
just<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.209> that<00:01:30.420> it'll<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.020> oven<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
just like that it'll go in the oven and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.669 
just like that it'll go in the oven and
keep<00:01:32.069> that<00:01:32.250> little<00:01:32.459> wavy<00:01:32.729> motion<00:01:33.679> without

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
keep that little wavy motion without

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.469 
keep that little wavy motion without
pushing<00:01:35.009> down<00:01:35.399> and<00:01:35.640> without<00:01:35.729> cracking<00:01:36.179> all

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

pushing down and without cracking all
over<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.750> place<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.289> I<00:01:37.319> like<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.459> also

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
over the place so I like that it's also

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.870 
over the place so I like that it's also
really<00:01:39.270> good<00:01:39.599> to<00:01:40.080> do<00:01:40.200> small<00:01:40.500> canes<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.250> cane

is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.410> nice<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:46.770> cane<00:01:47.069> right<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.580> see<00:01:47.910> how

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
is a nice little cane right here see how

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.370 
is a nice little cane right here see how
it's<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.509> thin<00:01:48.780> stripes<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's got some little thin stripes and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.290 
it's got some little thin stripes and
some<00:01:49.500> dots<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.009> stuff<00:01:50.160> that's<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.880> caning

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
some dots and stuff that's what caning

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.510 
some dots and stuff that's what caning
is<00:01:51.390> back<00:01:51.899> let<00:01:52.349> me<00:01:52.500> show<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.800> what<00:01:53.069> caning<00:01:53.429> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is back let me show you what caning is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
is back let me show you what caning is
so<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.910> see<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.209> well<00:01:54.390> primo<00:01:54.750> does<00:01:54.959> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so you can see how well primo does that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080 
so you can see how well primo does that
I've<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> couple<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.429> bits<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.789> primo

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I've got a couple little bits of primo

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.150 
I've got a couple little bits of primo
here<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.569> I've<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.289> put<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.800> clay<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
here and I've just put some clay and

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.510 
here and I've just put some clay and
some<00:01:59.640> colors<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.149> gonna<00:02:00.270> stack<00:02:00.539> them<00:02:00.720> all<00:02:00.780> up

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
some colors I'm gonna stack them all up

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.070 
some colors I'm gonna stack them all up
if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.940> hum<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.239> yourself<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.690> works<00:02:03.869> much

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
if you hum to yourself it works much

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.809 
if you hum to yourself it works much
better<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:05.069> just<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.399> trick<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
better it's just a little trick of the

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.190 
better it's just a little trick of the
trade<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.179> might<00:02:06.300> want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.599> so<00:02:07.080> what

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.490 
I've done is I've smashed all of this
bits<00:02:08.970> together<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.050> gonna<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.319> my

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
bits together and I'm gonna use my

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.870 
bits together and I'm gonna use my
little<00:02:10.709> trusty<00:02:10.860> blade<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.370> cut<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> right<00:02:11.819> down

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
little trusty blade to cut it right down

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.540 
little trusty blade to cut it right down
the<00:02:12.030> center<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.989> can<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.410> what<00:02:14.160> kind<00:02:14.459> of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
the center and you can see what kind of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.790 
the center and you can see what kind of
little<00:02:14.760> stripes<00:02:15.090> are<00:02:15.300> inside<00:02:15.750> once<00:02:16.530> that's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
little stripes are inside once that's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.830 
little stripes are inside once that's
cut<00:02:17.069> open<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.599> manipulate

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
cut open see that and I can manipulate

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.500 
cut open see that and I can manipulate
those<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.709> I've<00:02:19.890> done<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.400> until<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.270> get

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
those like I've done to this until I get

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.420 
those like I've done to this until I get
something<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:21.930> really<00:02:22.170> fun<00:02:22.709> now<00:02:23.129> once

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
something that's really fun now once

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.209 
something that's really fun now once
you've<00:02:23.610> made<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.849> cane<00:02:24.239> from<00:02:24.989> primo<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.799> can

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
you've made a cane from primo you can

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.020 
you've made a cane from primo you can
cut<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.579> with

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
cut it with

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.940 
cut it with
blade<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> part<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.920> I

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
blade and this is the part now that I

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.210 
blade and this is the part now that I
really<00:02:29.280> love<00:02:29.459> many<00:02:30.030> K<00:02:30.510> clays<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.410> caning<00:02:32.040> well

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
really love many K clays do caning well

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.460 
really love many K clays do caning well
but<00:02:32.610> they<00:02:33.360> don't<00:02:33.540> combine<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.050> ability<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
but they don't combine the ability to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.580 
but they don't combine the ability to
hold<00:02:34.830> those<00:02:35.220> details<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:36.180> mush<00:02:36.930> ability<00:02:37.440> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
hold those details with mush ability and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.710 
hold those details with mush ability and
I<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.950> mush<00:02:38.220> ability<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.180> once<00:02:39.360> you've<00:02:39.540> got

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
I like mush ability so once you've got

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.690 
I like mush ability so once you've got
some<00:02:39.900> cane<00:02:40.140> slices<00:02:40.319> like<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.770> I'm<00:02:41.550> gonna
