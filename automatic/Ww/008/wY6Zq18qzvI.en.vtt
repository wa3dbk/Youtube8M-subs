about five minutes with this polyester
resin<00:00:27.590> which<00:00:27.830> is<00:00:27.949> what<00:00:28.099> i'm<00:00:28.189> using<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:28.730> i'm

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
resin which is what i'm using and i'm

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.710 
resin which is what i'm using and i'm

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240 
mixing it with the with the sawdust
pretty<00:00:32.720> heavy<00:00:32.960> heavy<00:00:33.379> mix<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:33.890> seems<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.220> be

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
pretty heavy heavy mix it seems to be

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.689 
pretty heavy heavy mix it seems to be
whole<00:00:34.519> seems<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.269> be<00:00:35.980> pretty<00:00:36.980> good<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.250> bulked

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
whole seems to be pretty good I bulked

whole seems to be pretty good I bulked
it<00:00:37.790> up<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:38.000> little<00:00:38.120> bit<00:00:38.330> in<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.540> corner<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:39.110> here

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
it up a little bit in the corner of here

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.010 
it up a little bit in the corner of here
the<00:00:41.840> front<00:00:42.079> transom<00:00:46.149> I've<00:00:47.149> as<00:00:47.809> I've<00:00:47.989> been

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
the front transom I've as I've been

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260 
the front transom I've as I've been
going<00:00:48.469> I've<00:00:48.620> been<00:00:48.649> pulling<00:00:49.100> out<00:00:49.250> as<00:00:49.730> many<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
going I've been pulling out as many of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.360 
going I've been pulling out as many of
the<00:00:50.390> zip<00:00:50.539> ties<00:00:50.750> as<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.079> think<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.829> needs<00:00:51.890> in<00:00:52.219> that

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the zip ties as I think it needs in that

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.080 
the zip ties as I think it needs in that
batch<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:54.399> bit<00:00:55.399> premature<00:00:55.610> going

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
batch and then a bit premature going

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.930 
batch and then a bit premature going
right<00:00:56.239> over<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.570> epoxy<00:00:57.079> Phillips<00:00:58.039> which<00:00:58.760> I

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
right over the epoxy Phillips which I

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.340 
right over the epoxy Phillips which I
think<00:00:59.149> helped<00:00:59.420> i<00:00:59.510> probably<00:00:59.780> could<00:01:00.170> have<00:01:00.199> done

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
think helped i probably could have done

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.740 
think helped i probably could have done
it<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.770> same<00:01:01.070> way<00:01:01.309> without<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:02.059> epoxy

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
it the same way without the epoxy

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.299 
it the same way without the epoxy
phillips<00:01:03.079> and<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.350> remove<00:01:03.620> some<00:01:03.949> supplies

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
phillips and just remove some supplies

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.960 
phillips and just remove some supplies
at<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.550> time<00:01:04.759> I<00:01:05.000> didn't<00:01:05.690> really<00:01:05.930> think<00:01:06.619> of<00:01:06.740> that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
at a time I didn't really think of that

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.100 
at a time I didn't really think of that
so<00:01:07.970> I'm<00:01:08.060> going<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.360> batch<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.869> show<00:01:09.050> you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
so I'm going to do a batch and show you

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.469 
so I'm going to do a batch and show you
right<00:01:09.830> now<00:01:12.789> found<00:01:13.789> out<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.300> more

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
right now found out that the more

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.210 
right now found out that the more
hardener<00:01:14.929> you<00:01:15.050> add<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.410> quicker<00:01:15.619> at<00:01:15.860> Hortons

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
hardener you add the quicker at Hortons

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:27.960 
hardener you add the quicker at Hortons
I<00:01:17.170> got<00:01:18.170> waste<00:01:18.950> about<00:01:19.220> half<00:01:19.399> of<00:01:19.490> my<00:01:19.670> first<00:01:19.910> batch

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.460 

couple<00:01:28.240> works<00:01:28.360> great<00:01:28.570> have<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.840> four<00:01:29.110> hour<00:01:29.230> mark

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
couple works great have a four hour mark

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.270 
couple works great have a four hour mark
and<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.250> drew<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.760> chance<00:01:31.240> mark<00:01:31.620> only<00:01:32.620> I<00:01:33.040> guess

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
and I drew it a chance mark only I guess

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.370 
and I drew it a chance mark only I guess
for<00:01:33.430> them<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.700> mix<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.030> at<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.210> story<00:01:34.450> line

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
for them to mix it at the story line

00:01:35.380 --> 00:02:04.760 
for them to mix it at the story line
directions

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.890

that<00:03:39.430> I'm<00:03:39.640> using<00:03:39.960> your<00:03:40.960> own<00:03:41.110> reference<00:03:42.270> well

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
that I'm using your own reference well

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.810 
that I'm using your own reference well
let<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.600> how<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:43.930> turns<00:03:44.290> out<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
let you know how this turns out and the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.530 
let you know how this turns out and the
fool<00:03:46.060> too<00:03:46.360> thin<00:03:46.690> activity<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:54.040> it's<00:03:54.190> almost

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
fool too thin activity so it's almost

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.910 
fool too thin activity so it's almost
not<00:03:55.540> quite<00:03:55.600> bumpy

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.040 

maybe<00:03:59.550> that's<00:03:59.730> about<00:03:59.970> good<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.420> think<00:04:00.810> once<00:04:00.930> you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
maybe that's about good I think once you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:10.110 
maybe that's about good I think once you
had<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.170> filler<00:04:01.470> hard<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.920> fast<00:04:02.099> ish<00:04:02.340> there

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.140 

really<00:04:11.120> messy<00:04:11.510> and

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.830 

this<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.239> going<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.420> be<00:04:15.480> covered<00:04:15.750> by

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
this is going to be covered by

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.680 
this is going to be covered by
fiberglass<00:04:16.410> anyway

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.240 

I'm<00:04:22.140> sure<00:04:22.350> you'll<00:04:22.500> be<00:04:22.650> able<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.830> see<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:25.250> scene

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
I'm sure you'll be able to see the scene

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.940 
I'm sure you'll be able to see the scene
bounce<00:04:26.520> right<00:04:26.760> through

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.260 

going<00:04:35.950> really<00:04:36.130> quick<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.460> see<00:04:36.700> how<00:04:36.820> people<00:04:36.970> say

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.270 
going really quick I see how people say
that<00:04:37.390> they<00:04:37.540> can<00:04:37.690> do<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:37.900> in<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.050> weekend<00:04:38.410> build

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280
