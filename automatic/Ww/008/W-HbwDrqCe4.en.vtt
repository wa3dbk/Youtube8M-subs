00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.750
 so that again and again europe 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.860
 league thursday fathers fourth 221 5 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 Sacred circle Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.349
 and the game we are now 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.720
 want to watch is the game between 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.599
 fenerbahce istanbul and lazio rome 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.329
 fenerbahce was in the round 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.869
 the last 16 is the eighth-final of the 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.119
 116 enforced against viktoria pilsen 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.590
 that was a tight box 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.160
 Lazio had our German representative 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.720
 stuttgart thrown out 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.379
 fenerbahce is currently second in turkey 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.230
 lazio roms would have to look 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.480
 fourth is actually in the series a 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.530
 klose there now on the weekend 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.629
 given comeback 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.180
 near are fifth footprint they are 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:55.000
 slipped on place five fenerbahce 64 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.080
 percent performance currently but 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 after all, from the last five play 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.589
 There were four victories before two defeats 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.950
 defeats were important against that 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:11.890
 that was the 3 2 on the third third and 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:15.280
 before that moment the 2 3 in the Turkish cup 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.729
 against trabzonspor last won 2 0 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.259
 chiesa in front of antalyaspor 21 and 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.670
 before that, the draw against Viktoria 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.640
 Pilsen in the return match in the Europa League 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.500
 lazio, on the other hand, 57 and changes 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 just always defeat 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 defeat on 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.479
 last a 2 1 against catania in the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 klose there already while still there 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.830
 not against turin lost before 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.479
 protected won against lazio 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.840
 lost and won the protection so 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.860
 always changing 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.770
 successive hit these two 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.500
 teams not yet I see that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 at least not here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 yes in any case a top duel you can 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.970
 say and probably a duel too 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.320
 between two teams the big ones 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.320
 good chances actually have there 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.020
 what to rip the europe league 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 based on previous achievements 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.610
 best scorer for fenerbahce in the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.180
 europe league so far cristian baroni with 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.020
 kreuth has two at the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.720
 Roman Libor Kozak with Eight and Sergio 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.100
 floccari with four hits wheels son 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.930
 There are two on the account and I think so 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.510
 that was even koschak was 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.390
 even the guy I believe now even 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.690
 Much more gates in the earth plays in the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.760
 Europe league scored 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.190
 that often does not play in the league and 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.780
 Therefore, against stuttgart yes 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.180
 various times set 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.890
 is definitely a man you there 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.230
 must be in mind already at eight 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.349
 meet in the running europe league 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.730
 and yes you can say to us 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.500
 the two teams what is there for 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.990
 characters yes I believe raul meireles 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.170
 may play as far as I know 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.310
 So in the midfield engine I'd say 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.800
 if not just by unfair ones 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.830
 Otherwise striker moussa stands out 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.320
 sow 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.600
 every now and then dangerous who else 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.950
 increase milos krasic right 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.970
 outside striker came from juventus otherwise 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.190
 The best known is actually at 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.450
 fenerbahce is demirel embodied like that 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.900
 actually the team already 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.570
 years nationalkeeper of the turks 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.630
 otherwise yes christian the brazilian 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.950
 from the middle of the attacking midfield saw 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.620
 how should you call that afro matte 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.440
 who else is to call here in the squad me 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.950
 think so 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.030
 her cross is just here emperor 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.820
 with no thought that he is so little 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.610
 Market value has yes who is still there 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:08.750
 pierre webo have you in winter as 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:10.790
 purchased new and yes the Turkish 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.320
 playmaker has league in the europe 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.450
 a game entitlement is also still 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.959
 hurt just the same as Mehmet topal 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.420
 is currently even captain of the 11th 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.820
 but do not play because he 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.880
 already accumulated for atlÃ©tico madrid 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.680
 is in international business and at 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.490
 the one with a team of petkovic 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.210
 westermann Herne is the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.130
 midfielder of yes against stuttgart 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.860
 with such a small elbow strike 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.260
 questioned is noticed otherwise 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.870
 Cristian Ledesma defensive 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.040
 midfielder certainly too 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:57.160
 call marchetti the goalkeeper or the 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.160
 further still miro klose 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.999
 the upwards 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.999
 but are currently injured 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.940
 konko the right-back floccari with 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.419
 Thigh injury in defender 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.889
 diaz something on the adductors 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.570
 right-back bruno pereirinha with 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.669
 a thigh injury and 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:23.680
 cristian brocchi the gentleman 37 years old 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.050
 practice middle foot break otherwise 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.780
 various suspensions here 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.440
 We do not know what it is in there now 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.860
 individual goes and do not know now 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.510
 how does your your tip out for now 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.950
 game 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.330
 will be hard for anyone 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.290
 Fenerbahce I believe you there 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.700
 enforce 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.940
 I think in split a draw 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.190
 That's why I see altogether 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.220
 lazio slightly forward and so 60 40 for 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.419
 assess you the times 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.419
 his slight advantages for Lazio 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.540
 at micro is a bit like that 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.970
 I'll say witch cauldron 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.730
 that's why I think that fenerbahce that 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.460
 first game so bavaria for yourself 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.100
 decides and then in the hinspiel can 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.440
 Everything happens and that's why I want it 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.280
 I do not want to fix it on who 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.280
 the game wins
