00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.830 
through there if I spin Candace around
out<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.499> can<00:03:17.709> see<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.639> she's<00:03:19.180> got<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.629> decent

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
out you can see that she's got a decent

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.899 
out you can see that she's got a decent
amount<00:03:20.049> here<00:03:20.650> going<00:03:21.010> through<00:03:21.370> then<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.670> can't

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
amount here going through then you can't

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:29.539 
amount here going through then you can't
see<00:03:22.090> where<00:03:22.269> her<00:03:22.420> head<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:22.750> stops<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.260> stuff

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.369 

so<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:30.639> can<00:03:30.819> see<00:03:31.299> that<00:03:32.109> that<00:03:32.609> blends<00:03:33.609> through

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
so you can see that that blends through

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.940 
so you can see that that blends through
beautifully<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:36.129> coming<00:03:36.459> around<00:03:36.639> the<00:03:36.879> front

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
beautifully so coming around the front

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.819 
beautifully so coming around the front
very<00:03:38.950> important<00:03:39.669> that<00:03:39.879> you<00:03:40.000> pay<00:03:40.569> attention<00:03:40.829> to

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
very important that you pay attention to

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.129 
very important that you pay attention to
how<00:03:42.250> much<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.730> leave<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.389> depending<00:03:44.109> from

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
how much you leave and depending from

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.170 
how much you leave and depending from
client<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.739> client<00:03:44.829> how<00:03:45.519> much<00:03:45.699> air<00:03:46.000> they<00:03:46.030> have

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
client to client how much air they have

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.420 
client to client how much air they have
but<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.109> lot<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.349> them<00:03:47.560> can<00:03:47.739> have<00:03:47.919> very<00:03:48.189> very

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
but a lot of them can have very very

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.089 
but a lot of them can have very very
fine<00:03:48.760> baby<00:03:49.150> here<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.049> if<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.560> case<00:03:50.889> we

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
fine baby here so if that is the case we

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.709 
fine baby here so if that is the case we
probably<00:03:51.659> need<00:03:52.659> to<00:03:52.689> move<00:03:52.840> back<00:03:53.290> slightly

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:54.719 
probably need to move back slightly

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:25.100 
probably need to move back slightly
because<00:03:55.719> we<00:03:56.169> don't<00:03:56.530> want<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:56.980> see<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.609> tape

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.090 

when<00:04:26.110> you're<00:04:26.260> putting<00:04:26.470> them<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:26.800> through<00:04:26.980> the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
when you're putting them in through the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.670 
when you're putting them in through the
sides<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.730> important<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.240> just<00:04:28.540> rip<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.960> how

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
sides it is important to just rip it how

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.860 
sides it is important to just rip it how
you're<00:04:29.920> going<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.000> blending<00:04:31.600> through

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
you're going have that blending through

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.280 
you're going have that blending through
and<00:04:32.080> as<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.290> can<00:04:32.440> see<00:04:32.669> we<00:04:33.669> have<00:04:33.850> some<00:04:34.060> nice

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
and as you can see we have some nice

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.870 
and as you can see we have some nice
balance<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.590> hair<00:04:35.860> extensions<00:04:36.190> coming<00:04:36.700> all

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
balance of hair extensions coming all

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.780 
balance of hair extensions coming all

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
the way through Candice is here and when

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.540 
the way through Candice is here and when
I<00:04:39.820> pull<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.270> hair<00:04:40.480> back<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.830> blends<00:04:42.160> through

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
I pull the hair back it blends through

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.730 
I pull the hair back it blends through
nicely<00:04:42.790> so<00:04:43.270> here<00:04:43.450> we<00:04:43.570> are<00:04:43.600> all<00:04:43.870> finished<00:04:44.410> and
