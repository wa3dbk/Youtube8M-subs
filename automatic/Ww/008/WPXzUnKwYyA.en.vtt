00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
video we're talking about the next gen

video we're talking about the next gen
GTA<00:00:18.240> 5<00:00:19.140> version<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.740> also<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> pc<00:00:21.119> version

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
GTA 5 version and also the pc version

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.230 
GTA 5 version and also the pc version
and<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.500> likelihood<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> those<00:00:23.910> being

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
and when the likelihood of those being

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.349 
and when the likelihood of those being
announced<00:00:24.539> because<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.039> think

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
announced because you have to think

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.429 
announced because you have to think
rockstar<00:00:27.359> would<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:27.750> pass<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
rockstar would not pass up the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.710 
rockstar would not pass up the
opportunity<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:29.369> make<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.789> lot<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> extra<00:00:30.570> money

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
opportunity to make a lot of extra money

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250 
opportunity to make a lot of extra money
on<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:32.009> next-gen<00:00:32.820> console<00:00:33.390> version<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
on a next-gen console version for the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.150 
on a next-gen console version for the
GTA<00:00:34.920> 5<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.570> also<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.260> amount<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> money<00:00:37.770> they

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
GTA 5 and also the amount of money they

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.630 
GTA 5 and also the amount of money they
would<00:00:38.309> generate<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:39.239> making<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.899> GTA<00:00:40.680> 5<00:00:41.010> PC

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
would generate from making a GTA 5 PC

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
would generate from making a GTA 5 PC
version<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.870> pretty<00:00:43.170> safe<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> say<00:00:43.680> at

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
version so it's pretty safe to say at

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
version so it's pretty safe to say at
least<00:00:44.570> logically<00:00:45.570> thinking<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.410> being

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
least logically thinking and just being

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.310 
least logically thinking and just being
you<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.969> intelligent<00:00:48.600> person<00:00:48.780> just

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you know an intelligent person just

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
you know an intelligent person just
thinking<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> already<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.600> GTA<00:00:52.050> 5

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
thinking that there is already a GTA 5

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.670 
thinking that there is already a GTA 5
if<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:53.010> almost<00:00:53.309> done<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.120> done<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> works

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
if not almost done if done in the works

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
if not almost done if done in the works
you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.460> some<00:00:56.820> sort<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.360> progress<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.170> done

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you know some sort of progress is done

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.670 
you know some sort of progress is done
for<00:00:58.890> GTA<00:00:59.250> 5<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.539> pc<00:01:00.899> version<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:01.379> mean<00:01:01.559> it's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
for GTA 5 on the pc version i mean it's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
for GTA 5 on the pc version i mean it's
it's<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:01.949> um<00:01:02.750> likelihood<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> that's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it's just um likelihood that that's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.399 
it's just um likelihood that that's
that's<00:01:04.439> possible<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:06.119> i<00:01:06.240> said

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
that's possible because like i said

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.539 
that's possible because like i said
rockstar<00:01:07.409> wouldn't<00:01:07.799> pass<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
rockstar wouldn't pass up the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.450 
rockstar wouldn't pass up the
opportunity<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.290> millions<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.070> dollars

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
opportunity to make millions of dollars

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240 
opportunity to make millions of dollars
on<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.090> pc<00:01:12.450> version<00:01:12.840> people<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.560> asking<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.130> it

on a pc version people are asking for it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
on a pc version people are asking for it
people<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.549> dying<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.960> gonna

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
itself I mean I don't see why they

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.910 
itself I mean I don't see why they
wouldn't<00:02:02.189> do<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> also<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.619> next

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920

wouldn't do it and also just the next
gen<00:02:05.070> consoles<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> big<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
gen consoles is like the big thing you

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.479 
gen consoles is like the big thing you
know<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> mean<00:02:07.140> everybody's<00:02:07.770> making<00:02:07.979> games<00:02:08.369> for

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
know I mean everybody's making games for

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.309 
know I mean everybody's making games for
next<00:02:08.879> gen<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> think<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.080> kind<00:02:10.259> of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
next gen so I think it would be kind of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.530 
next gen so I think it would be kind of
foolish<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> even<00:02:11.400> sort<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
foolish and even sort of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.500 
foolish and even sort of
unbusinesslike<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:14.519> rock<00:02:14.730> star<00:02:15.000> which<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.299> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
unbusinesslike for rock star which is a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750 
unbusinesslike for rock star which is a
billion-dollar<00:02:16.290> corporation<00:02:17.219> that<00:02:17.370> thinks

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
billion-dollar corporation that thinks

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.030 
billion-dollar corporation that thinks
about<00:02:18.000> money<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.079> needs<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.530> have

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
about money because it needs to have

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.069 
about money because it needs to have
money<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.609> order<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.909> keep<00:02:21.269> itself<00:02:21.599> running

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
money in order to keep itself running

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.959 
money in order to keep itself running
that<00:02:22.859> they<00:02:23.159> would<00:02:23.340> pass<00:02:23.549> up<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.939> opportunity

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
that they would pass up the opportunity

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.140 
that they would pass up the opportunity
on<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> next<00:02:25.230> gen<00:02:25.439> and<00:02:25.650> even<00:02:26.219> the<00:02:26.370> pc<00:02:26.579> versions

see<00:04:00.810> what<00:04:01.470> if<00:04:02.060> any<00:04:03.060> improvements<00:04:03.930> they<00:04:04.079> could

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
see what if any improvements they could

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.399 
see what if any improvements they could
make<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.739> GTA<00:04:05.400> 5<00:04:05.760> maybe<00:04:06.449> they<00:04:06.659> make<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.079> more

sounds really really likely and it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.779 
sounds really really likely and it
actually<00:04:33.540> makes<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.080> lot<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.229> sense<00:04:34.610> priming<00:04:35.610> by
