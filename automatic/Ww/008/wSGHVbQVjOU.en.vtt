00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.750
 they were cooking black erlan 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.680
 pour 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 a bottle of beer mug like that 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:23.349
 look here is such a frothy hat 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.450
 formed at Yelansky became then foam 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.310
 so loose it so general order 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.890
 Yelansky will become as it should not be 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.820
 You see such a nice and beautiful and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.620
 we had a beer 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.379
 The following is what they ask me 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.699
 how much is the shelf life 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.559
 live natural homemade beer and here 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.860
 there was somehow a question saying i read that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.430
 the shelf life of this beer is 57 that's if 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.320
 now take this beer to filter or 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.239
 when after you cooked it 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.370
 if you filter it immediately that is 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.160
 filter out the yeast expiration date 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.620
 This beer is really 5-7 days 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.690
 live beer that is beer in which here 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.520
 here on the bottom is thin 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.759
 live yeast layer 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.160
 it can be stored long enough here 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.770
 For example here is a Belgian beer at Shama 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.740
 His storage period is 3 years respectively 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.960
 well, and other varieties of live beer, they 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.150
 also stored for three some 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 even four years there is even a beer 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.850
 called Russian Persian became 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.860
 belgian she matures in bottles 18 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.189
 months that is a year and a half before 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.780
 she gets into shopping 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.200
 accordingly I made beer I had 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.150
 the usual advise that the first time tries 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.810
 his three months that is here is 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.150
 beer will leave some bottles to try 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.369
 in half a year itâ€™s too tired 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.549
 better like every living drink and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.500
 try a beer a year later I had 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.689
 a beer that was even three years old 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.490
 sent him to his friends in Moscow they 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.909
 tried to say that beer just well 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 the amazing thing is this 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.210
 beer is live it is like any live drink 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.190
 like bottled wine she continues 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.260
 ripen taste becomes more 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.390
 harmonious and more qualities 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.760
 Well I wish you success in your home 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.920
 brewing and even want to say 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.200
 what about the live beer batter that now 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.360
 on many bottles they write live beer so 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.690
 here at the bottom of the live beer is 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.440
 a thin-thin layer of yeast is alive and 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.840
 you 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.140
 entities can do the following you 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.500
 can pour it into a glass drink it 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.709
 and add some remaining yeast 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.500
 sugar 1 ferment they multiply 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.830
 and on the basis of those already here that's yeast 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.170
 i did something with this beer jimmy 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.180
 you can make your beer well of course if 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.030
 you will find a good beer a good grade 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.690
 for example belgian you can like this 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.690
 here to make
