reach the handle material and I milled

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.770 
reach the handle material and I milled
around<00:00:37.309> some<00:00:37.760> of<00:00:37.879> these<00:00:37.969> points<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.629> know

see<00:01:57.710> getting<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.100> bit<00:01:58.280> smoother<00:01:59.200> now<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.260> bolts

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
see getting a bit smoother now the bolts

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.170 
see getting a bit smoother now the bolts
are<00:02:00.830> getting<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.070> little<00:02:01.280> bit<00:02:01.370> shinier<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.060> uh

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
are getting a little bit shinier and uh

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
I think I want to leave this wait is it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.680 
I think I want to leave this wait is it
slow<00:02:07.400> enough<00:02:07.760> I<00:02:07.910> don't<00:02:08.090> feel<00:02:08.240> it'll<00:02:08.509> be<00:02:08.660> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
slow enough I don't feel it'll be a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.279 
slow enough I don't feel it'll be a
hinderance

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
hinderance

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.060 
hinderance
I'll<00:02:09.890> round<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.280> off<00:02:10.459> some<00:02:11.020> it's<00:02:12.020> uh<00:02:12.140> that's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
I'll round it off some it's uh that's
