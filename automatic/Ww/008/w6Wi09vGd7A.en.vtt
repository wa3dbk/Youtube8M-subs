that we call a low static load which is

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.190 
that we call a low static load which is
a<00:01:43.329> wear<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.259> tear<00:01:44.499> on<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.709> body<00:01:44.859> and<00:01:45.929> what<00:01:46.929> can

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
what can help it well physical activity

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.910 
what can help it well physical activity
is<00:01:51.729> very<00:01:52.179> beneficial<00:01:52.389> because<00:01:53.139> it<00:01:53.439> helps<00:01:53.770> to
