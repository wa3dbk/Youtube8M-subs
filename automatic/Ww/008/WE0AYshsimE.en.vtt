a taste you know a little bit better

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.439 
a taste you know a little bit better
with<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.639> blueberries<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.209> it

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
with the blueberries in it

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.869 
with the blueberries in it
it's<00:03:42.569> naturally<00:03:43.410> rich<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.739> omega<00:03:44.069> threes<00:03:44.489> and

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
it's naturally rich in omega threes and

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.970 
it's naturally rich in omega threes and
it's<00:03:45.090> great<00:03:45.389> for<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.629> dietary<00:03:46.109> fiber<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.829> also

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
it's great for a dietary fiber it also

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.949 
it's great for a dietary fiber it also
has<00:03:47.190> protein<00:03:47.639> in<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.849> as<00:03:48.090> well<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.810> is

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
has protein in it as well so this is

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.479 
has protein in it as well so this is
really<00:03:49.139> great<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.590> add<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.889> your<00:03:49.980> smoothie<00:03:50.129> but

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
really great to add to your smoothie but

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.220 
really great to add to your smoothie but
just<00:03:50.639> be<00:03:50.699> careful<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:51.480> will<00:03:51.780> go<00:03:51.959> straight<00:03:52.139> to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
just be careful it will go straight to

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.379 
just be careful it will go straight to
your<00:03:52.470> use<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.099> be<00:03:53.819> careful<00:03:54.209> when<00:03:54.299> you're

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
your use so be careful when you're

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.569 
your use so be careful when you're
adding<00:03:54.569> this<00:03:54.780> start<00:03:55.019> out<00:03:55.139> small<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:56.280> serving

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
adding this start out small the serving

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.640 
adding this start out small the serving
size<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.940> two<00:03:57.120> tablespoons<00:03:57.269> for<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.169> so

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
size is two tablespoons for this so

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.650 
size is two tablespoons for this so
maybe<00:03:58.889> start<00:03:59.129> out<00:03:59.280> with<00:03:59.370> 1<00:03:59.669> tablespoon<00:04:00.269> if<00:04:00.480> you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
maybe start out with 1 tablespoon if you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.949 
maybe start out with 1 tablespoon if you
aren't<00:04:01.560> used<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:02.010> eating<00:04:02.459> flaxseed<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
aren't used to eating flaxseed so the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.449 
aren't used to eating flaxseed so the
first<00:04:04.199> step<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.980> add<00:04:05.099> all<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.340> your

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
first step is to add all of your

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.069 
first step is to add all of your
ingredients<00:04:05.549> together<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:06.389> I've<00:04:06.900> already

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
ingredients together so I've already

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.900 
ingredients together so I've already
pre-made<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> smoothie<00:04:08.040> here<00:04:08.190> which<00:04:08.400> I'll<00:04:08.669> just

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
pre-made a smoothie here which I'll just

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.180 
pre-made a smoothie here which I'll just
save<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.329> tomorrow<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.949> what<00:04:11.099> it

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
save for tomorrow and this is what it

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.710 
save for tomorrow and this is what it
looks<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.489> when<00:04:11.849> you've<00:04:11.970> got<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.150> all<00:04:12.389> put

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
looks like when you've got it all put

for<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.300> many<00:04:29.420> years<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:30.650> just<00:04:30.860> add<00:04:31.010> your

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.970 
for so many years so just add your
greens<00:04:31.460> at<00:04:31.990> quite<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.020> bit<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.410> want<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.680> lot<00:04:33.830> in

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
greens at quite a bit you want a lot in

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.680 
greens at quite a bit you want a lot in
there<00:04:34.130> don't<00:04:34.340> reside<00:04:34.550> like<00:04:34.760> three<00:04:35.120> leaves<00:04:35.390> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
there don't reside like three leaves and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.170 
there don't reside like three leaves and
then<00:04:36.440> you're<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:36.860> want<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.160> add<00:04:37.310> your

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180
