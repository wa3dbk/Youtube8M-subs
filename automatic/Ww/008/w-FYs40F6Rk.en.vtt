00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
that by accident it's like that largely

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.440 
that by accident it's like that largely
because<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.040> shooting<00:02:26.250> people<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
way that it's managed to make it happen

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.520 
way that it's managed to make it happen
it's<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:30.030> about<00:02:30.510> far<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.780> than<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it's it's about far more than just the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.900 
it's it's about far more than just the
shooting<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> percentage<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> day's

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
very very small you spend far more the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.250 
very very small you spend far more the
day<00:02:37.080> having<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.070> chair<00:02:38.400> having<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.240> drink<00:02:39.660> eating

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
on and I believe it although it's a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.479 
on and I believe it although it's a
tradition<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.620> hunting<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.070> shooting<00:03:11.100> in

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
shooting is a sport it's not about

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.470 
shooting is a sport it's not about
coming<00:03:44.130> out<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.580> killing<00:03:44.940> things<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.330> is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
coming out and just killing things it is

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.210 
coming out and just killing things it is
about<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.780> challenge<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.739> about<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.010> day

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
about a challenge and it's about a day

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.920 
about a challenge and it's about a day
out<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.640> social<00:03:47.970> thing<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.269> network<00:03:48.600> thing

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
out and a social thing the network thing

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.220 
out and a social thing the network thing
as<00:03:49.530> well<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:51.000> would<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.480> misconception

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
as well so it would be a misconception

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.140 
as well so it would be a misconception
to<00:03:52.470> think<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:53.070> people

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
to think it's just people

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.640 
to think it's just people
blood-thirsty<00:03:55.150> coming<00:03:56.080> out<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.560> know

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
blood-thirsty coming out to it you know

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.250 
blood-thirsty coming out to it you know
most<00:03:56.920> people<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.280> know<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.610> she<00:03:57.870> hate<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.080> see

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
most people I know that she hate to see

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.990 
most people I know that she hate to see
and<00:03:59.680> we<00:03:59.920> need<00:04:00.040> cutaways<00:04:00.490> at<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.730> end<00:04:00.820> of<00:04:00.940> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
and we need cutaways at the end of the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.680 
and we need cutaways at the end of the
day<00:04:01.120> they<00:04:01.500> genuinely<00:04:02.500> care<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.910> for<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
day they genuinely care and for the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.060 
day they genuinely care and for the
countryside<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.380> for<00:04:05.500> what<00:04:05.620> they're<00:04:05.740> doing

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
countryside and for what they're doing

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.850 
countryside and for what they're doing
so<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.570> would<00:04:08.020> definitely<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.410> misconception

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
so that would definitely a misconception

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.500 
so that would definitely a misconception
think<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.460> just<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.700> bloodsport

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.660
