things it does is it provides sort of

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.450 
things it does is it provides sort of
protective<00:01:07.329> qualities<00:01:07.600> for<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.170> plants<00:01:08.590> it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
protective qualities for the plants it's

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.980 
protective qualities for the plants it's
like<00:01:09.670> if<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.939> like<00:01:10.119> in<00:01:10.659> high<00:01:10.840> light

was<00:03:06.040> these<00:03:06.419> apples<00:03:07.419> miss<00:03:07.599> region<00:03:07.959> here's<00:03:08.349> one

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
was these apples miss region here's one

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.620 
was these apples miss region here's one
of<00:03:08.680> them<00:03:08.829> aren't<00:03:08.980> gonna<00:03:09.069> cut<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.370> open<00:03:11.459> and

of them aren't gonna cut it open and

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.599 
of them aren't gonna cut it open and
you'll<00:03:13.630> see<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.349> actually<00:03:14.530> not<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.220> red<00:03:15.489> on

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
you'll see it's actually not just red on

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.170 
you'll see it's actually not just red on
the<00:03:15.700> skin

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
the skin

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.319 
the skin
but<00:03:16.540> red<00:03:16.720> all<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.900> way<00:03:17.019> through<00:03:17.669> so<00:03:18.669> as<00:03:18.940> a

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
but red all the way through so as a

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.849 
but red all the way through so as a
breeding<00:03:19.720> target<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.410> would<00:03:20.500> be<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.590> very

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
breeding target that would be a very

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.309 
breeding target that would be a very
interesting<00:03:21.510> sort<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.540> proposition<00:03:23.109> to

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
interesting sort of proposition to

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.620 
interesting sort of proposition to
produce<00:03:23.470> an<00:03:23.769> apple<00:03:24.099> that<00:03:24.730> has<00:03:24.790> if<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.450> like

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
produce an apple that has if you like

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.470 
produce an apple that has if you like
these<00:03:25.840> good<00:03:26.079> qualities<00:03:26.290> these<00:03:27.480> beneficial

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
these good qualities these beneficial

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.180 
these good qualities these beneficial
qualities<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.870> our<00:03:28.959> diet<00:03:29.319> all<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.069> way

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
qualities to our diet all the way

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.740 
qualities to our diet all the way
through<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:30.819> is<00:03:30.970> chock-full<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.540> these

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
through so this is chock-full of these

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.650 
through so this is chock-full of these
and<00:03:31.959> for<00:03:32.500> science<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.760> if<00:03:33.880> these<00:03:34.030> red<00:03:34.359> fleshed

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
and for science so if these red fleshed

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.839 
and for science so if these red fleshed
apples<00:03:35.079> are<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.470> good<00:03:35.769> for<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.980> being<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.519> full

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
apples are so good for you being so full

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.250 
apples are so good for you being so full
of<00:03:36.940> anthocyanin<00:03:37.419> why<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.109> eat

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
of anthocyanin why don't we just eat

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.430 
of anthocyanin why don't we just eat
those<00:03:38.609> well<00:03:39.609> unfortunately<00:03:40.359> they<00:03:41.049> taste

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
those well unfortunately they taste

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.250 
those well unfortunately they taste
pretty<00:03:41.919> awful<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.090> what<00:03:43.239> we<00:03:43.359> need<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:43.930> is

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
pretty awful so what we need to do is

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.470 
pretty awful so what we need to do is
take<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.310> characteristics<00:03:46.209> we're<00:03:46.299> looking

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
take the characteristics we're looking

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.030 
take the characteristics we're looking
for<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.840> Apple<00:03:47.049> for<00:03:47.470> example<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.889> red

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
for on this Apple for example the red

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.220 
for on this Apple for example the red
flesh<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.639> put<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.359> into<00:03:49.599> an<00:03:49.690> apple<00:03:50.019> that

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
flesh and put it into an apple that

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.550 
flesh and put it into an apple that
already<00:03:50.919> has<00:03:51.160> all<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.370> right<00:03:51.780> qualities<00:03:52.780> for

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
already has all the right qualities for

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.120 
already has all the right qualities for
consumers<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.519> retailers<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.359> growers<00:03:55.570> and

consumers and retailers and growers and

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.379 
consumers and retailers and growers and
to<00:03:57.130> do<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.489> we've<00:03:57.699> traditionally<00:03:57.940> done<00:03:58.209> it

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
to do that we've traditionally done it

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.029 
to do that we've traditionally done it
through<00:03:58.690> breeding<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.470> that's<00:03:59.590> been<00:03:59.799> very

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:00.039 
through breeding and that's been very

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.350 
through breeding and that's been very
successful<00:04:00.070> for<00:04:00.789> thousands

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
successful for thousands

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.380 
successful for thousands
thousands<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:01.870> years<00:04:02.880> but<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.970> trouble<00:04:04.240> is

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
thousands of years but the trouble is

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.150 
thousands of years but the trouble is
it's<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.930> very<00:04:05.140> expensive<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.860> time-consuming

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
it's a very expensive and time-consuming

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.300 
it's a very expensive and time-consuming
process<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.900> takes<00:04:08.140> many<00:04:08.440> many<00:04:08.890> years

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
process it takes many many years

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.210 
process it takes many many years
possibly<00:04:09.760> decades<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:11.130> thousands<00:04:12.130> of

crosses<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:13.240> actually<00:04:13.540> find<00:04:13.750> an<00:04:13.870> Apple<00:04:14.200> that

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
crosses to actually find an Apple that

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.020 
crosses to actually find an Apple that
combines<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.950> right<00:04:15.100> qualities<00:04:15.550> from<00:04:15.760> here

with the right qualities from here

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.550 
with the right qualities from here
however<00:04:18.850> there<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.330> little<00:04:20.019> bit<00:04:20.170> of<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.290> trick

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
however there is a little bit of a trick

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.440 
however there is a little bit of a trick
you<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.709> use<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.280> reduce<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.820> time<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
you can use to reduce that time and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.080 
you can use to reduce that time and
that's<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.410> find<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.890> gene<00:04:24.100> responsible<00:04:24.370> for

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
that's to find the gene responsible for

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.480 
that's to find the gene responsible for
the<00:04:25.150> cross<00:04:25.390> you<00:04:25.600> want<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.020> in<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.770> Apple<00:04:27.250> and

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
the cross you want in in this Apple and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.990 
the cross you want in in this Apple and
then<00:04:28.390> track<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.110> gene<00:04:29.500> in<00:04:29.770> all<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.520> progeny

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
then track that gene in all the progeny

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.610 
then track that gene in all the progeny
from<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.390> crosses<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.110> two<00:04:32.290> different

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
from the crosses of the two different

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.280 
from the crosses of the two different
apples<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:33.130> you're<00:04:33.250> involved<00:04:33.490> with<00:04:34.290> by

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
apples that you're involved with by

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.200 
apples that you're involved with by
doing<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.920> can<00:04:35.950> reduce<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.610> time<00:04:36.850> and

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
doing that you can reduce the time and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.790 
doing that you can reduce the time and
reduce<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.720> effort<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.110> producing<00:04:38.650> new

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
reduce the effort to producing new

years<00:04:45.220> ago<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:45.520> start<00:04:45.760> on<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:46.030> project<00:04:46.240> we

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
years ago we start on this project we

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.600 
years ago we start on this project we
didn't<00:04:46.720> know<00:04:46.810> what<00:04:46.960> gene<00:04:47.170> was<00:04:47.320> responsible<00:04:47.980> so

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
didn't know what gene was responsible so

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.800 
didn't know what gene was responsible so
we<00:04:48.730> had<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:48.940> go<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.150> look<00:04:49.300> for<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.600> and

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
we had to go and look for that and

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.900 
we had to go and look for that and
through<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.050> series<00:04:50.230> of<00:04:50.980> various<00:04:51.760> genetic

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
through a series of various genetic

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.540 
through a series of various genetic
tests<00:04:52.390> we<00:04:52.570> found<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:53.050> gene<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> transcription

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
tests we found a gene a transcription

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.700 
tests we found a gene a transcription
factor<00:04:55.090> that<00:04:55.330> we<00:04:56.260> thought<00:04:56.440> was<00:04:56.590> responsible

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
factor that we thought was responsible

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.630 
factor that we thought was responsible
for<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:59.080> color<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.680> Apple<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.250> up<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.520> that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
for the color in Apple and up to that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.050 
for the color in Apple and up to that
stage<00:05:00.910> no<00:05:01.210> one<00:05:01.330> had<00:05:01.450> found<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.910> what<00:05:03.910> we

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
stage no one had found that and what we

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.670 
stage no one had found that and what we
found<00:05:04.270> was<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.540> transcription<00:05:05.290> factor<00:05:05.650> that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
found was a transcription factor that

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.350 
found was a transcription factor that
appears<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.700> regulate<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:09.180> biosynthesis<00:05:10.180> of

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
appears to regulate the biosynthesis of

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.800 
appears to regulate the biosynthesis of
these<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:11.470> these<00:05:11.740> colors<00:05:12.220> so<00:05:12.810> transcription

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
these of these colors so transcription

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.340 
these of these colors so transcription
factor

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
factor

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.159 
factor
acts<00:05:14.710> in<00:05:15.070> effect<00:05:15.370> like<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.550> a<00:05:15.940> switch<00:05:16.330> it

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
acts in effect like a a switch it

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.530 
acts in effect like a a switch it
regulates<00:05:17.800> other<00:05:18.160> genes<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.940> in<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.210> case

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
regulates other genes and in this case

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.620 
regulates other genes and in this case
this<00:05:19.810> gene<00:05:20.140> which<00:05:20.320> we<00:05:20.470> called<00:05:20.710> MD<00:05:21.010> mid<00:05:21.250> 10

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
this gene which we called MD mid 10

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.090 
this gene which we called MD mid 10
regulates<00:05:22.630> a<00:05:22.900> subset<00:05:23.410> of<00:05:23.440> other<00:05:23.680> genes<00:05:24.010> that

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
regulates a subset of other genes that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.860 
regulates a subset of other genes that
are<00:05:24.220> involved<00:05:24.550> in<00:05:24.880> producing<00:05:25.060> these<00:05:25.570> plant

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
are involved in producing these plant

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.130 
are involved in producing these plant
pigments<00:05:26.440> in<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.650> anthocyanin<00:05:27.130> pathway<00:05:28.140> so

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
pigments in the anthocyanin pathway so

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.680 
pigments in the anthocyanin pathway so
that's<00:05:29.320> good<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:29.530> now<00:05:29.830> we<00:05:29.890> can<00:05:30.160> go<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.760> talk<00:05:31.630> to

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
that's good so now we can go and talk to

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.000 
that's good so now we can go and talk to
the<00:05:31.990> people<00:05:32.110> who<00:05:32.260> do<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.500> breeding<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:32.919> the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
the people who do the breeding and the

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.170 
the people who do the breeding and the
people<00:05:33.280> who<00:05:33.340> do<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.550> mapping<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:34.030> these

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
people who do the mapping of these

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.690 
people who do the mapping of these
things<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:34.780> here's<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.410> gene<00:05:35.740> if<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.400> trace

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
things and so here's a gene if you trace

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.640 
things and so here's a gene if you trace
this<00:05:36.910> gene<00:05:37.210> through<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:38.080> crosses<00:05:38.500> and

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
this gene through the the crosses and

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.040 
this gene through the the crosses and
all<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.830> siblings<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:40.300> know<00:05:40.510> that<00:05:40.810> those

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
all the siblings you know that those

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.900 
all the siblings you know that those
siblings<00:05:41.350> are<00:05:41.680> going<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:41.919> contain<00:05:42.280> or<00:05:42.669> have<00:05:42.880> a

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
siblings are going to contain or have a

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.640 
siblings are going to contain or have a
likelihood<00:05:43.360> of<00:05:43.600> containing<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.229> gene<00:05:44.470> in

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
likelihood of containing this gene in

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.530 
likelihood of containing this gene in
this<00:05:44.740> red<00:05:44.979> flesh<00:05:48.060> so<00:05:49.060> we<00:05:49.120> found<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.390> gene

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
this red flesh so we found the gene

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.740 
this red flesh so we found the gene
responsible<00:05:49.690> for<00:05:51.210> switching<00:05:52.210> on<00:05:52.330> if<00:05:52.450> you<00:05:52.570> like

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
responsible for switching on if you like

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.320 
responsible for switching on if you like
the<00:05:53.169> other<00:05:53.260> genes<00:05:53.560> that<00:05:53.680> make<00:05:53.979> all<00:05:54.160> this<00:05:54.340> red

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
the other genes that make all this red

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.750 
the other genes that make all this red
flesh<00:05:55.600> and<00:05:55.720> in<00:05:55.780> fact<00:05:55.900> these<00:05:56.050> trees<00:05:56.380> in<00:05:56.760> their

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
flesh and in fact these trees in their

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.490 
flesh and in fact these trees in their
natural<00:05:57.910> surroundings<00:05:58.540> for<00:05:58.780> example<00:05:59.169> in<00:05:59.290> in

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
natural surroundings for example in in

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.469 
natural surroundings for example in in
Kazakhstan<00:06:00.220> they're<00:06:00.700> not<00:06:00.820> only<00:06:00.970> red<00:06:01.210> fleshed

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
Kazakhstan they're not only red fleshed

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.719 
Kazakhstan they're not only red fleshed
and<00:06:01.690> red<00:06:01.840> skins<00:06:02.169> but<00:06:02.950> the<00:06:03.040> whole<00:06:03.160> tree<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.490> red

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
and red skins but the whole tree is red

we<00:06:36.910> really<00:06:37.300> wants<00:06:37.480> to<00:06:37.540> find<00:06:37.810> out<00:06:37.990> was<00:06:38.370> how<00:06:39.370> come

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
we really wants to find out was how come

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.400 
we really wants to find out was how come
one<00:06:39.970> variety<00:06:40.180> that's<00:06:40.720> so<00:06:40.960> genetically

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
one variety that's so genetically

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.490 
one variety that's so genetically
similar<00:06:42.060> can<00:06:43.060> have<00:06:43.420> for<00:06:43.840> example<00:06:43.870> green

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.600 
similar can have for example green
leaves<00:06:44.800> and<00:06:45.420> white<00:06:46.420> flesh<00:06:47.410> in<00:06:47.740> its<00:06:48.010> fruit<00:06:48.400> and

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
leaves and white flesh in its fruit and

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.060 
leaves and white flesh in its fruit and
another<00:06:50.040> variety<00:06:51.040> have<00:06:51.550> red<00:06:52.270> leaves<00:06:52.780> and<00:06:53.200> red

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
another variety have red leaves and red

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.570 
another variety have red leaves and red
flesh<00:06:54.640> in<00:06:54.850> its<00:06:54.970> fruit

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.790 

so<00:06:58.480> we<00:06:58.630> looked<00:06:58.840> more<00:06:59.020> closely<00:06:59.230> at<00:06:59.650> this

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
so we looked more closely at this

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.120 
so we looked more closely at this

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
knew at the controls anthocyanin

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.200 
knew at the controls anthocyanin

made into protein it binds and switches

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.130

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140 
on all the genes that make anthocyanin

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.620 
on all the genes that make anthocyanin
when<00:07:12.100> we<00:07:12.190> looked<00:07:12.400> at<00:07:12.520> the<00:07:12.610> gene<00:07:12.790> structure<00:07:13.450> we

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630 
when we looked at the gene structure we

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.900 
when we looked at the gene structure we
saw<00:07:13.870> an<00:07:14.020> area<00:07:14.380> where<00:07:14.560> its<00:07:14.860> protein<00:07:15.370> binds<00:07:15.700> its

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
saw an area where its protein binds its

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.930 
saw an area where its protein binds its
own<00:07:16.030> DNA<00:07:16.540> it<00:07:16.810> switches<00:07:17.410> itself<00:07:17.710> on<00:07:18.010> we<00:07:18.790> found

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
own DNA it switches itself on we found

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.060 
own DNA it switches itself on we found
in<00:07:19.150> red<00:07:19.390> flesh<00:07:19.660> dapples<00:07:20.110> this<00:07:20.560> area<00:07:20.950> is

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
in red flesh dapples this area is

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.820 
in red flesh dapples this area is
mutated<00:07:21.730> so<00:07:22.210> it<00:07:22.360> can<00:07:22.540> bind<00:07:22.750> six<00:07:23.170> times<00:07:23.470> as<00:07:23.650> much

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
mutated so it can bind six times as much

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.040 
mutated so it can bind six times as much
protein<00:07:24.150> this<00:07:25.150> means<00:07:25.510> that<00:07:25.660> the<00:07:25.780> gene<00:07:26.020> is

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050 
protein this means that the gene is

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.840 
protein this means that the gene is
driven<00:07:26.380> harder<00:07:26.860> so<00:07:27.160> it<00:07:27.280> makes<00:07:27.490> all<00:07:27.670> those

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
driven harder so it makes all those

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.880 
driven harder so it makes all those
other<00:07:28.090> anti<00:07:28.450> silent<00:07:28.870> genes<00:07:29.050> work<00:07:29.320> harder<00:07:29.770> and

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
other anti silent genes work harder and

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.060 
other anti silent genes work harder and
so<00:07:30.250> you<00:07:30.310> get<00:07:30.550> more<00:07:30.700> color<00:07:31.560> so<00:07:32.560> it<00:07:32.650> goes<00:07:32.830> to<00:07:32.860> show

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
so you get more color so it goes to show

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.700 
so you get more color so it goes to show
the<00:07:33.370> relatively<00:07:33.880> small<00:07:34.300> change<00:07:35.020> a<00:07:35.290> relatively

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710 
the relatively small change a relatively

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.150 
the relatively small change a relatively

use all this information to look at how

we breed more successfully more

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.470 
we breed more successfully more
