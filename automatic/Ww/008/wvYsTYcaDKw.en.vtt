00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
which comes with a couple of relatively

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.390 
which comes with a couple of relatively
minor<00:00:43.630> bugs<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.380> first<00:00:44.620> one<00:00:44.800> when<00:00:45.010> you<00:00:45.070> go<00:00:45.220> in

minor bugs the first one when you go in

to<00:00:45.550> select<00:00:45.880> what<00:00:46.090> carrier<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.720> want<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.050> use

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
to select what carrier you want to use

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.110 
to select what carrier you want to use
if<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.440> actually<00:00:47.620> go<00:00:47.950> into<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.460> menus<00:00:48.880> and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
if you actually go into the menus and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.910 
if you actually go into the menus and
look<00:00:49.420> up<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:49.930> know<00:00:50.050> which<00:00:50.230> carrier<00:00:50.740> which

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
look up you know which carrier which

network<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.370> be<00:00:51.490> on<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.940> think<00:00:52.240> the<00:00:52.330> bug<00:00:52.450> was

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
network to be on I think the bug was

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.850 
network to be on I think the bug was
that<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.870> would<00:00:52.930> hang<00:00:53.200> trying<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.680> search

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
that it would hang trying to search

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.100 
that it would hang trying to search
through<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.340> so<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:55.150> may<00:00:55.330> just<00:00:55.540> not<00:00:55.690> want<00:00:55.990> to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
through that so you may just not want to

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.270 
through that so you may just not want to
do<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.380> immediately<00:00:56.620> unless<00:00:57.070> you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
do that immediately unless you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.770 
do that immediately unless you
absolutely<00:00:57.400> have<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.360> there<00:00:58.600> was<00:00:58.690> an

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
absolutely have to and there was an

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.450 
absolutely have to and there was an
issue<00:00:58.870> syncing<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.440> calendar<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.070> android

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
issue syncing the calendar on android

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.000 
issue syncing the calendar on android
4.4<00:01:00.970> which<00:01:01.510> apparently<00:01:01.960> can<00:01:02.320> be<00:01:02.440> fixed<00:01:02.830> by

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
4.4 which apparently can be fixed by

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.799 
4.4 which apparently can be fixed by
rebooting<00:01:03.310> the<00:01:03.550> device<00:01:03.580> twice<00:01:04.210> keep<00:01:04.659> in<00:01:04.780> mind

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
rebooting the device twice keep in mind

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.960 
rebooting the device twice keep in mind
though<00:01:05.080> this<00:01:05.259> will<00:01:05.530> only<00:01:05.770> work<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.340> unlock

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
though this will only work on unlock

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
though this will only work on unlock
devices<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:07.960> requires<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.470> full<00:01:08.680> wipe<00:01:08.950> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
devices and it requires a full wipe so

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.030 
devices and it requires a full wipe so
maybe<00:01:10.840> don't<00:01:10.930> go<00:01:11.229> trying<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:11.650> your<00:01:11.799> daily

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
maybe don't go trying it on your daily

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.770 
maybe don't go trying it on your daily
driver<00:01:12.280> just<00:01:12.549> yet<00:01:12.850> unless<00:01:13.270> you're<00:01:13.479> ready<00:01:13.630> to

driver just yet unless you're ready to
just<00:01:14.020> drop<00:01:14.200> everything<00:01:14.820> most<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.090> know

it when i'm on Wi-Fi or if I've got

the<00:01:30.670> last<00:01:30.790> build<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.180> wanted<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.510> mention

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
the last build I wanted to mention

the last build I wanted to mention
actually<00:01:32.260> really<00:01:32.680> jumped<00:01:32.979> out<00:01:33.070> at<00:01:33.130> me<00:01:33.280> because

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
actually really jumped out at me because

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.360 
actually really jumped out at me because
it's<00:01:34.540> for<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.780> device<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.500> not<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.800> new

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
it's for a device that is not a new

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the chromium bill tracker and what do we

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.780 
the chromium bill tracker and what do we
know<00:04:43.960> about<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.320> other<00:04:44.470> than<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.920> not<00:04:45.760> a

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
know about it other than that not a

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.840

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
thing in all honesty having some

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.130 
thing in all honesty having some
experience<00:04:49.240> with<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.390> Nexus<00:04:49.690> 5<00:04:49.840> at<00:04:50.020> this

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
experience with the Nexus 5 at this

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.530 
experience with the Nexus 5 at this
point<00:04:50.470> i<00:04:50.680> would<00:04:50.800> say<00:04:51.040> hopefully<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:52.090> has<00:04:52.240> some

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
point i would say hopefully it has some

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.970 
point i would say hopefully it has some
bug<00:04:52.720> fixes<00:04:52.750> for<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.350> cameras<00:04:53.830> and

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
bug fixes for the cameras and

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.440 
bug fixes for the cameras and
performance<00:04:54.430> fixes<00:04:54.760> for<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.970> camera<00:04:55.270> maybe

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
performance fixes for the camera maybe

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.540 
performance fixes for the camera maybe
and<00:04:55.750> hopefully<00:04:56.500> some<00:04:57.010> battery<00:04:57.340> life

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
and hopefully some battery life

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.820 
and hopefully some battery life
improvements<00:04:58.300> because<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:58.960> far<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.350> Nexus<00:04:59.680> 5

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
improvements because so far the Nexus 5

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.190 
improvements because so far the Nexus 5
camera<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.460> battery<00:05:00.640> have<00:05:01.030> been<00:05:01.270> let's<00:05:01.990> say<00:05:02.170> a

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
camera and battery have been let's say a

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.350 
camera and battery have been let's say a
bit<00:05:02.410> of<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> weak<00:05:02.770> spot<00:05:03.010> at<00:05:03.580> least<00:05:03.850> in<00:05:04.000> terms<00:05:04.150> of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
bit of a weak spot at least in terms of

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.030 
bit of a weak spot at least in terms of
software<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.170> hopefully<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.620> isn't<00:05:05.920> just

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
software so hopefully this isn't just

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.470 
software so hopefully this isn't just
some<00:05:06.100> random<00:05:06.370> build<00:05:06.790> that<00:05:07.000> has<00:05:07.150> gotten

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
some random build that has gotten

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.870 
some random build that has gotten
mentioned<00:05:07.960> over<00:05:08.170> there<00:05:08.350> in<00:05:08.590> passing<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.190> it

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
mentioned over there in passing that it

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.730 
mentioned over there in passing that it
doesn't<00:05:10.330> actually<00:05:10.420> exist<00:05:10.690> hopefully<00:05:11.590> this

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
doesn't actually exist hopefully this

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.720

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
will actually turn into something

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.730 
will actually turn into something
that'll<00:05:13.060> be<00:05:13.150> useful<00:05:13.300> bug<00:05:13.750> fixes<00:05:14.200> updates
