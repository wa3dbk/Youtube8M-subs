00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 sometimes passing along any branch 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.759
 you start to wonder whether it is worth it at all 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.410
 buy top tank especially often 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 ask this question when on the go 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.730
 pumping meets to and be bright 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 device requiring more attention 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 for example, such a situation occurred with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.779
 branch t110 4 where after m18 on my 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.850
 look at all there was no point swing 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.460
 country house with a calm soul it was possible 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 keep driving at level six by 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.960
 one of these branches, I walked for almost a year 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 very unobtrusively getting to e50m and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.560
 seemingly essay tank is in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 the tenth level and there should be some 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.200
 good reasons for finding him there and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.420
 if 162 and batts all I the first time 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
 it is in the expediency of buying it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.030
 This top tank I doubted and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.500
 the main reason for this E50 well that his 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.629
 intrigued let's start the most important armor 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 it is she who is considered a tank chip 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.800
 the address of both and fifties can be heard 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.260
 this is the most armored st on its 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.210
 level and in general they will be right although not 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 completely what it costs for example the tower 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.480
 but they are true later 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.640
 hangar tth talk about identity 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 both tanks if you take into account 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 only a millimeter but we are a people 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 smart and we just can not catch it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.240
 even visually identifiable 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.220
 somewhat lower height E50m because of what 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.560
 it seems even a little wider but it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.720
 true illusion she caused just that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.540
 because of the scourge of the height of the wider arches 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.180
 caterpillars the most important thing to understand 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.860
 Is the angle of inclination different after 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.110
 simple sausages interaction with 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 graphic editor can say 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.430
 the angle of inclination of both capuses is identical and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 approximately equal to 60 two and a half 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.530
 degrees with an error of half a degree where 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 so taking into account 5 degrees and normalization 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090
 given by the whale about 280 millimeters but 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.549
 is it if thereâ€™s no yes 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.009
 talk about other parts of the hulls in general 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.810
 sense and not see even if there go from 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.479
 at least some wrong difference then 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.399
 no effect in battle will result if 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.920
 I also note this thin strip 5 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.770
 mm screen alongside E50m 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.259
 but also nothing gives 1 weighty difference 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.020
 This is something that the E50 engine is criticized 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.759
 shoot in the forehead and here at e50m and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.430
 but you will still not be lit 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.870
 because the seventh-level Germans are no longer 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.569
 burn on the forehead of the tower the same Well Well 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 that's generally the same doe tens she 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.250
 weighs a bit more crit it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 a little more difficult but also all the armor 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.390
 also in v.n. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.580
 review turning speed is the same honest 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.010
 the difference is the tower itself is shifted a little 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.720
 forward as far as i know it should 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 give slightly better declination angles 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.299
 if the gun on the password forwards and all 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.280
 I thought for a long time what kind of music 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.280
 put hope you all understand 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.260
 they are the same in everything exactly 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.020
 dropping information in stabilization and in 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.360
 recharge up to the cell for a fraction of a second 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.240
 the only difference is armor penetration 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.450
 but but you charge a sabot projectile 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.320
 and you get the same kind of breakout of that 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.140
 tenth grade level oh well 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.780
 mobility well here and 50 m for sure 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.440
 1200 horsepower will win against 9 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.080
 hundred difference is the obvious ten even 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.670
 weigh 3 tons less put them friend 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.690
 near a friend on different types of soil and 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.190
 let's see how confidently wins e50m 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.440
 the joke is that the only difference is 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.410
 when overclocking example to 35 kilometers an hour 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.870
 everything else is just the same in the end 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.940
 Level 10 broke out at 20-30 meters 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.540
 ahead and and gave a few increase 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.070
 the difference 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.290
 and the reason is hidden 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.170
 patency over all and laughed 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.880
 it is precisely because of him that it is clear that I did 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.340
 This is so that 50 more could even 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.740
 somehow move around the battlefield but when 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.050
 the same body of the blacksmiths and even with 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.030
 greater ground resistance with primer 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.920
 level nine significantly lower 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.180
 but it's worth all the same to open it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.250
 most moving in the game 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.350
 happens in short jerks from one 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.790
 points to other maneuvers from arta and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.650
 tank wrecks detour around 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.900
 some home and other moving to 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.910
 one hundred two hundred meters maximum in them 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.130
 E50m will be much more vigorous to tear with 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.870
 places well and I think that it is obvious that 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.240
 the maximum speed of both tanks is the same 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.100
 forward that back also will not hide 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 fact significantly more turning in 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.990
 dozens in the city it just will not 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.190
 over 300 hp cube difference you fly in 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.320
 Gold quality is one third less 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.120
 probability of fire when hit 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.770
 the engine and the engine itself will be by 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.300
 Mast all this all the benefits of e50m in 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.760
 turn nine has a number 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.310
 the benefits associated precisely with his 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.190
 level on the E50 is a chance to get against 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.100
 strong levels and rest assured 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.560
 definitely not in 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.720
 from happy to meet you boom on 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.550
 dozens given bonus for attack more 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.380
 high level opponents and 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.690
 this very bonus is expressed in the form of experience 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.940
 and loans well, and the latest is simple 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.570
 corny cheaper repair and now 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.460
 a little bit of mathematics e50m so 6100,000 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.040
 Naturally to buy it in sell 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.590
 LVL 9 for half the price that is almost two 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.750
 million comes out more than 4 million 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.820
 the actual difference for this you get 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.710
 through better dynamics the transmission in the stern 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.940
 thing likelihood of fires dviglo 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.870
 Podkalibera when the main shell 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.760
 cumulative as gold and it's all 4 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.070
 million you can buy a huge 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.900
 the number of gold shells and ride on 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.060
 essentially speaking at the tenth level 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.940
 being on the ninth while often 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.640
 not at all going to minus well I think 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.170
 conclusions already do for themselves sml 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.170
 cents all good luck and bye
