00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.730
 i love how you manage i'm driving 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.499
 the wheel you see some indication on 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.789
 how to center the wheel some small 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.829
 advice is a complicated thing about 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.839
 maybe c hi fi and you must have a point 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.849
 reference to understand when the 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.160
 circle approaching moves away 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.920
 because if centered it always remains the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.070
 same distance if it is not, move away 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.890
 is approaching from the reference point if 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.999
 it moves away if it moves away you have to 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.430
 screw the inner spokes those from the 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.100
 part if it moves away from here it's here 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.920
 the more air they cause to live, which is the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 terno that you see that I dress this not 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.219
 end the external call here not because 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.020
 I was trying to finish inside ok so yes 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.329
 they must therefore avoid if there is more space 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.109
 what then ends up is inhabited 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.300
 side of the space if it goes to land instead 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.090
 retaliate or grateful then, yes 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.010
 must avoid external ones 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.440
 I talked about screwing the spokes it 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.869
 same effect can be done by reasoning at 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.420
 unscrewing unveiling then 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.310
 when it is screwed it turns in the direction 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.619
 counterclockwise 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.330
 when you want to live you have to turn 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.880
 counterclockwise 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.869
 when you want to avoid it you have to turn 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.280
 clockwise it is easy 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.040
 This has to do the hard thing 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.520
 build the wheel because in addition to the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.900
 centering let's say left and right 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.000
 horizontal 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.280
 the perfect circle must also be made 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.670
 because if there remains the wheel is not 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.479
 a 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.030
 a circle becomes an oval and therefore 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.070
 in the centering that lasts an operation 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.500
 that you ca n't do even without being a 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.149
 wheel expert I say to mount the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.610
 wheel in decided to want experts 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.470
 telling the wheel is one thing and therefore 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.090
 these are the indications you have 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.210
 given founded band for everyone at his point 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.439
 the difficulty is having a tripod 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.180
 something that blocks the wheel for 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.680
 being able to fashion it and a point of 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.049
 reference is the worst case scenario 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.909
 you can put the bike upside down and how 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.039
 landmark to organize the brakes 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.690
 and so ok so this gave us 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.170
 indication that already promises anyone in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.420
 degree 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.980
 as the easel is now part of 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.930
 another video I'll do this to you 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
 easel than a person alone before 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.010
 there is the video so you are looking for 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.380
 coffee bike stand an easel 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.150
 fantastic that allows you to do a lot 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.709
 of operations practically raise 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.080
 forward the adults as is alone 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.280
 including we have already included the axis of 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.910
 people the duration is then difficult that 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.530
 when doing maneuvers on the spokes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.810
 there is a risk of giving tensions that 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.540
 so the wheel is not homogeneous 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.190
 it was centered but then maybe yes 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.410
 they break the x-rays you pulled at him 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.660
 too much or because you've loosened it too much 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.690
 so you should also look a little 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.970
 to understand that they are differences 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.530
 so since you can act on one 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.660
 magistracy on the other ray 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.280
 legends you have to understand according to how 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.829
 are pirates that I hold this but 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.780
 slow it big if the wheels are old 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.010
 there is a risk that it will break at the beam 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.599
 or 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 there is the risk that it gets smeared that it loses 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:17.480
 the dentition, in short, the typical fact must 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.879
 being caught by the key you hear I drive 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.159
 I've been around I need a beam there 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.930
 I had trouble finding the beam 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.269
 of the same size for a 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.840
 cycling tourist with courage traveling sites 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.760
 right it was because my bike maybe one 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.630
 something a little special that there is not 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 they all have it 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.750
 There are many to have racists 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.350
 kilometers can definitely be one 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.360
 good a good thing certainly yes but 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.770
 let the rivoli finish I finish the video 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.330
 framing the easel also 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.980
 from the high matter that I give to you from 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.980
 just delicious to stay in bed that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.459
 in addition to an optical part it is also fine 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650
 hear the noise our dear noise 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.450
 constant 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.310
 ok this case the mood of is constant 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.900
 this I have to give fairly central of 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.320
 good dance yes unfortunately when there is 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.790
 so much silence, however, a land that is ok 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.230
 enough to constant noise you can 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.070
 understand very well 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.070
 ok guys
