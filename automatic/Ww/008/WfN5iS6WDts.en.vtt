00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.759
 Most sellers and negotiators 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.650
 loss of fear the price is just one 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.869
 factor of many 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.369
 he is not the decisive point 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.260
 that my deepest inner conviction 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.449
 and so out of the loss of fear 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.560
 purely negative in the winner mentality 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.980
 thoughts always a negative 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.260
 Result 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.250
 If I say tomorrow, I also have to 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.360
 Schranner whose hard 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.350
 negotiator i get ready 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.989

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.519
 he only wants the price from the end 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.129
 but this time I bring irish even better 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.049
 our performance is worth the he for 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.659
 that price gets over it then becomes 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.580
 the transaction at least something 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.110
 positive the rise above small talk in 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.729
 a negotiation but only that 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.589
 topic I do 0 small talk in the beginning 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.210
 two minutes business then like 815 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.830
 smalltalk as you start into the race 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.019
 in a negotiation so you drive often 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.430
 podium statistic formula one looks at now 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.290

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.650
 first six starting places always drive 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.970
 on the podium 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.190
 even the entry is crazy 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.770
 climb you a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.060
 And every time you give me a break 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.300
 I can only ask why is 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.320

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.450
 or one agrees to say so 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.580
 They dare to go here and not further 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.200

 in the morning only because the bubble is full 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.290
 but if you are not of yourself 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.640
 confident in a transaction like 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.230

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.000
 the more diligently they are prepared 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.320
 the better they go in the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.910
 Negotiations are much more important 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.580
 value it also on the argumentation 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.770

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.200
 Point is goals you all know you need 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.280
 do not tell a story, yes, like a goal 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.290
 are you me too ? 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.190
 I do not care about the quarterly goals 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.200
 annual target 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.090
 Look, I'm concerned about something else 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.440
 I'm concerned with something completely different 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.790
 I'm concerned with the goals she has 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.570
 sellers before putting in the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.880
 Negotiations go 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.590
 what are your negotiation goals which 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.020
 My goal is what I want to achieve 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 a minimum to what you are and with what 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.900
 from the search I say yes too 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.760
 I'm not completely in receipt 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.380
 sometimes you have to meet but 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.610
 I always say that hard because 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.250
 I give him small factors 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.860
 I write a wish list every year 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.959
 upon request, customer list of 30 customers 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.610
 I want to rock this year 30 kilos 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.330
 says that such a horny taxi company 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.340
 I want to get in there 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.750
 that must be visualized in mine 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.090
 team even happens that we 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.130
 logos was visually hung in the office 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.690
 my deepest inner conviction when 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.070
 today again someone says to them in 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.410
 the negotiation preparation or 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.170
 Generally in life you can not do that 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.070
 then please say that for the please 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.090
 you to be 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.090
 but not for me
