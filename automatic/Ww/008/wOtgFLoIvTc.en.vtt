00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.500
 I tell you that you have such good 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 Ever wondered what's inside 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.840
 a processor to me always called me the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.590
 curiosity more striking than 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:18.390
 I say that there will be already good inside we can 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.390
 know we are going to see it 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.630
 fix 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 Well this is what we find 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.230
 inside the processor this is a 21-4 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.669
 ok it's old it did not work you're 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 pretty old I had it at home rolling 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.340
 in a drawer and I say what I'm going to open I'm going 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 to open to see what we find as 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.409
 you can see here is the chip in 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 internal chip is below this 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:48.300
 obviously and this here goes from this is the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.479
 housing el and hs and also by its acronyms 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479
 in English 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.330
 as you can see here 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.930
 this is a soldier with a weld 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.760
 because sandy bridge use this 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.060
 type of welding that makes 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.560
 thermal transmission between the housing and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.869
 the ies and the chip is worth later when 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.200
 they take the ivy bridge like for example the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.229
 47 70 that if bridge instead of using 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.710
 this type of thermal link by 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.440
 welding used a thermal paste 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.540
 that by the way the thermal paste of 47 70 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.310
 you can change vale is a little 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.690
 start ok you have to do this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.460
 minimum has to do this you have to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.100
 open it clean the thermal paste and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.780
 spreading it again is a laborious process 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.060
 I say that I'm hungry for a rock that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.030
 change the thermal paste and lower the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.710
 temperature but a lot of low the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.670
 temperature 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.710
 but well that 's more mess and that's me 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.440
 that I know is even so dangerous does 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.890
 to load the processor 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.710
 but that wanted to bring this to you in case 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.710
 you were curious what is there in 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.510
 the inside of the processor 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.710
 and I thought there was a family of 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.060
 dwarves in there working but not no 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.160
 I have not found them, I do not know if 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.950
 they will have fallen when as when I have 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.650
 open this charted was not so much 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.090
 mystery the truth and good I wanted 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.910
 share it with you if someone 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.660
 I had in mind to say and fuck that there 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.340
 down that down there on the casing that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.550
 by the way, what is recorded here 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.550
 above 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.380
 when you put the refrigerator on top 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.920
 refrigerate these sheets are cooled and 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.310
 that freshness passes to the chip and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.530
 reflecting what's worth 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.630
 good guys nothing else was just that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.660
 It was to share with you what 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.550
 there was inside a processor we do not see 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.550
 guys in the next video goodbye
