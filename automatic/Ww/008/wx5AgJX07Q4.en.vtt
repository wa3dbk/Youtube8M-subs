 I can stretch it 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:54.250

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.420
 This is something like a mirror when taking a selfie 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.560
 But I think it can be seen that he is captured 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.400
 And while charging, it 's blinking here 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.050

 It is the place to hear 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.710
 And this screen is tiny 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.550
 Once upon a time I I was met with the children I sense that there dove 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.030

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.030

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 But in fact it is the effect but of course you can not take videos 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.530

 580 Milian Bear Power is very small 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.569
