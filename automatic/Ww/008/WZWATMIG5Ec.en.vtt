00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello today is day number 5 of the video 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.780
 week and today you can again 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.939
 something will win or something will become today 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.350
 Contributed to the winner package and also 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.660
 in this video is again a number 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 hidden means to look attentively 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 if you do not understand what I mean 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.330
 just talking lets the infobox have times 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.010
 I again explained everything exactly I have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590
 I thought in a video week allowed 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 the theme of food is not missing so there I am 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 I always like to be there with you and me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780
 that's why my favorite next 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
 put together for you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.949
 So it used to be like that for me when I was 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.479
 came home from school and that 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.180
 still the time where I then not yet 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.129
 You have always cooked yourself 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 Quite often said yes I cook the same 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.180
 yes you can ever kind of a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
 slice cheese or something and then it was 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.299
 it somehow holds so now has the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.019
 slice cheese and actually that's it 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.460
 not so cool 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.190
 and which one is indeed not long 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.589
 fed up and that's why I thought so yes 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.269
 actually I taste here in the wg 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.739
 often in between and I wanted 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.590
 Just show you what I am like that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 and what I found really good and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.530
 That's why I would say we do not talk 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.729
 long drum now it's just me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.960
 I wish you a lot of fun then 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.960
 maybe also good appetite 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.079
 Number one is a modified bus 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.310
 This is how you first need it 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.390
 toast bun cream cheese a tomato 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.939
 smaller just a bit rucola 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.680
 remained pepper salt and miscellaneous 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.850
 wanted to take spicy you because I have 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.340
 first something important 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.869
 Forgot to forget garlic for 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.280
 the taste is not missing and the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.299
 I cut in for the first time 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.299
 small pieces 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.690
 then it's like tomato turn 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.270
 The first really before I do that 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.890
 make it receptive to this strunk 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.260
 so in any case this style 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.840
 and then cut it once and lengthwise 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.310
 once across and then arise so pieces 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.770
 and if you are still too big 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300
 at eur tomato just as monstrously huge 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.830
 is like mine then you can do that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.080
 Of course, so again in the middle 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.380
 just cut it that way 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.380
 are appropriate to the mouth 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.540
 I then give the tomatoes to the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.430
 put the garlic in a bowl and season it 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.480
 whole as I like and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.480
 then I give a little bit more 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.430
 olive oil over all tomatoes too 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.140
 cover and I miss that then everything 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.970
 and adjusts to the drag refrigerator 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.459
 leave and while it draws I comfort 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.319
 ever my route and sweeps the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.319
 then thin with cream cheese 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.970
 and then you can mix the tomatoes 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.930
 just give it to the buns and everything 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.270
 distribute well 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.860
 wash a bit of rucola and then 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 still drape on top and I have 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.200
 then garnished everything a bit 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 with balsamic cream and that's mac 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.780
 number one finished and I think that 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.780
 really delicious 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.010
 we go with number two and snack 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.780
 that's really undisputed 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.510
 you also need your favorite milk 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.840
 what a sweet and avocado 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.640
 lemon juice and the avocado halve 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.790
 I first bypasses the whole thing 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.020
 avocado meat in a container that 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.240
 Of course you can do the milk 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.910
 normal milk I prefer 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.410
 but soy milk because of this sojadrink 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.360
 because I really like with agave syrup 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.850
 sweetie of it just one 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.550
 tablespoon full and then add to them 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.340
 the abo came along and also almost one 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.170
 whole tablespoon of lemon juice and that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.600
 I have then also times and then 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.790
 it starts to weight and I give 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.739
 so almost half a liter too 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.570
 not very short below the 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.100
 mark then you need one 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.600
 magic wand or if you have it 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.800
 Of course you also have a smoothie mixa 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.870
 You can do that as you like 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.870
 and then you will do it all the way up 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.850
 really nice creamy is so like 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.350
 here in the west almost and then you can 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.600
 it already in your smoby mug or 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.060
 refill and fill a whole new glass 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.370
 serve and just as good and this 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.959
 mug as well as ultra cool so he has 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.260
 in which stays with a lot of time until the end 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.260
 tuned 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.090
 we come to the third and last act 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.250
 at the same time as the dessert 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.860
 you need to do this first 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.930
 apple and carrot nut mix the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.539
 but salted is and again something 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.610
 to have sweet and lemon juice the apple 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.009
 I washed and then halved and then 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.719
 Shaken and before I did anything 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:52.699
 Of course I did that further 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:54.590
 Core case removed when the apple 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.680
 is prepared you need a series 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.270
 and the bigger holes and then 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.560
 you just keep the whole apple and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.909
 if you do that the shell 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.979
 you always stay up there then you stay 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.270
 not yet the finger away afterwards 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.919
 just a bit of lemon juice 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.539
 give it over and stir that with it 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.759
 the apple is not too brown 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.830
 discolored the carrot is then peeled 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.810
 By the way, one is perfectly adequate 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.400
 I noticed and then cut 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.430
 I'm the end of the and drives the 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.969
 but also about this smaller part of the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.650
 line 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.930
 By the way, that's very powerful 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.699
 elaborately receives quite funny 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.699
 really worthwhile in any case 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.030
 and then you can do it a bit 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.479
 sweet just a bit at will 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.279
 what about water your sweet baby 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.689
 agave vi juice beer always the whole 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.330
 mix and then mix 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.249
 stir in and then you are already 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.139
 almost done and then everything will be done again 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.969
 and the mixture can be directed 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.039
 and I say you it tastes that way 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.550
 infinitely good really nice juicy 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.949
 and that 's it with the video again 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.319
 that was deep next now I show you 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.879
 of course something else from this video 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.520
 winner package is contributed 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.849
 i can give you bad avocado is pure 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.870
 do or apple or carrots or 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.069
 That's why I thought so now 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.870
 really cool if you also become a 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.310
 gets better and that's why I have there 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.509
 one ordered now still packed 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.770
 that's why i show you this now 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.539
 just by my weather 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.340
 So this mug right now 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.469
 already filled with avocado smoothie 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.659
 has seen is just a smoothie 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.939
 mug of this out 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.949
 Sliding mechanism from the tube has that 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.620
 means there is this wanted to get out 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.180
 which is also made of rubber and then can 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.509
 you always have to push that and 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.029
 then there is just tight and if you have the 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.379
 on screwed because you can just then be 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.689
 drinking rows fill I believe it 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.219
 fitting in about 450 milliliters 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:43.020
 if I remember correctly 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.610
 and I think he's pretty 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.560
 looks cool so I do not know but 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.180
 I have enough to drink 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.979
 and so I thought to myself as a 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.120
 get back to yes and then I hope 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.029
 Of course that you found the time 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.409
 and you liked the video and 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.599
 then it was already again 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.490
 In any case send me your pictures 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.289
 if you do any of that and 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.599
 does not link on it or daily with 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.759
 the hashtag nokia probably just and 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.349
 yes, because I can see that and grow 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.849
 also tried something like such 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.409
