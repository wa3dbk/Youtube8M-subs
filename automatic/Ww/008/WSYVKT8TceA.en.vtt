and the only one that actually is is the
the<00:01:56.210> phone<00:01:56.390> dialer<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.050> can<00:01:57.200> see<00:01:57.350> have

the phone dialer so you can see have

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.040 
the phone dialer so you can see have
quite<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:57.830> nice<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.370> blue<00:01:59.030> theme<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.870> one

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
quite a nice of blue theme on that one

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.450 
quite a nice of blue theme on that one
but<00:02:00.229> other<00:02:00.350> than<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.560> everything<00:02:01.100> else<00:02:01.250> is

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
but other than that everything else is

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.130 
but other than that everything else is
pretty<00:02:01.670> standard<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.390> if<00:02:02.479> we<00:02:02.570> go<00:02:02.720> into<00:02:02.930> sort<00:02:03.110> of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
pretty standard so if we go into sort of

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.320 
pretty standard so if we go into sort of
the<00:02:03.229> messaging<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.890> all<00:02:04.729> sort<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.090> clock

the messaging and all sort of the clock
that<00:02:05.540> kind<00:02:05.870> of<00:02:05.900> stuff<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.350> can<00:02:06.620> see<00:02:06.950> that's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
that kind of stuff you can see that's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.130 
that kind of stuff you can see that's
all<00:02:07.400> pretty<00:02:07.640> much<00:02:07.880> stock<00:02:08.209> OS<00:02:08.479> which<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:08.989> bit

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
all pretty much stock OS which is a bit

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.990 
all pretty much stock OS which is a bit
of<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.259> shame<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.429> have<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> slightly

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
of a shame and you have a slightly

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.149 
of a shame and you have a slightly
different<00:02:11.299> slide<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> lock<00:02:12.620> screen<00:02:12.650> and

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
different slide on the lock screen and

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.979 
different slide on the lock screen and
I've<00:02:13.940> still<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> lot<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.569> screen<00:02:14.780> clock

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989
