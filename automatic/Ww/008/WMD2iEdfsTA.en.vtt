00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
not a bold aroma you pick up a little

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.340 
not a bold aroma you pick up a little
bit<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.280> bread<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> barley<00:02:41.030> malt<00:02:41.209> some<00:02:41.810> water

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.910 

maybe<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.650> touch<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.890> hops<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:47.500> I've<00:02:48.500> had<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.709> lot

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
maybe a touch of hops but I've had a lot

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.740 
maybe a touch of hops but I've had a lot
of<00:02:48.950> other<00:02:49.280> German<00:02:49.970> pills<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.360> does<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.600> have

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
of other German pills and does that have

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.890 
of other German pills and does that have
a<00:02:50.780> lot<00:02:50.989> bolder<00:02:52.090> smell<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.390> let's<00:02:53.600> see<00:02:53.750> about

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
a lot bolder smell so let's see about

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.250 
a lot bolder smell so let's see about
the<00:02:54.020> taste

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.740 

this<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.380> interesting<00:03:03.650> because<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:05.540> really

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
this is interesting because it's really

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.140 
this is interesting because it's really
hop<00:03:06.020> forward<00:03:06.470> which<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.430> guess<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.790> should<00:03:08.000> be

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
hop forward which I guess it should be

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.570 
hop forward which I guess it should be
as<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.300> pilsner<00:03:08.720> but<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:10.130> just<00:03:10.280> get<00:03:10.430> those

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
as a pilsner but you just get those

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.020 
as a pilsner but you just get those
bitter<00:03:10.940> hops<00:03:11.240> right<00:03:11.660> up<00:03:11.810> front<00:03:12.700> I'm<00:03:13.700> thinking
