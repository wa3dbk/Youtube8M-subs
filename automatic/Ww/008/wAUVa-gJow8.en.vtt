00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:10.790
 do 2 dynamo draw bell 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.790
 made say and draw with one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.759
 next to that name on a bicycle with a rope 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.759
 and the spring or is teak 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.779
 this is what I made on a op 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.840
 a standard on one on a pole and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.449
 plate on the floor so had to have 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.949
 show how it works 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.399
 so this comes on the inside in the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.950
 go ahead so you pull dynamo 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.260
 so I have one on the outside 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.879
 button that you pull at 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 the moment if one draws then it goes 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.710
 so that bell rings 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.079
 so you generate the power on or for the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:58.640
 doorbell at the moment when you meet that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:03.559
 pull bell pulls so he turned on that power 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.559
 for your doorbell for your front door 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.900
 he thought it was a funny idea 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.030
 then I would have made this idea again 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.869
 improved again but it still needs one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.869
 be improved 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 if you really agree it will be this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.040
 idea where should that still be small 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.040
 become compact 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.159
 more user-friendly 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.869
 but that depends on how the people 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 think about this about a dynamo draw bell 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.740
 but it will cost you so so all you 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.040
 hear something new but that will cost you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.810
 no flow of beer because you became yourself 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.180
 actually at the moment when you get it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.790
 draws you your energy on power 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 before you call the I go again one 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.630
 a twitch a few times 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.990
 in addition, that hamel with a rope 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.450
 with the spring yes I have now used stig 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.310
 but there is actually a spring on the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.290
 front and this will share for may two 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.190
 doors must be with such a pull 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.030
 button then turns on again 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.030
 show a break-up 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:01.349
 yes this was a share 2 dynamo pull 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.349
 who you improve 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.890
 I actually have to improve again 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.870
 but that's what I come along here 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.110
 I say now better show how 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.110
 it's working 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.100
 have made in 30 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:34.570
 yes this was a dynamo garden 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.500
 pull out your front door 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.500
 energy saving
