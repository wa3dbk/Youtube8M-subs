00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello guys other languages ​​and first of all 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.210
 tell you that it does not go much to the camera 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.019
 because I'm in my underpants 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.670
 that will leave without limit 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.370
 so that the thing does not get hot 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.760
 good today I come to talk about 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.340
 ps vita tv an invention that has been taken to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.620
 schumi of the sleeve and that I think that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840
 does the try 2 competition of that 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.180
 as absurd it seems to me that if nintendo 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.530
 makes a bullshit for the others is 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.480
 they have to do bullshit to 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.810
 do not stay behind and whoever wants more 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.940
 asshole wins 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.960
 he does not understand much of what master 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.450
 of ps vita tv because good in order 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.390
 read the news on several websites 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.219
 explanations that do a little different 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.309
 then I saw that explanatory video that they do 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.140
 for fools and more or less because I got 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.850
 that was a kind of platform 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.739
 strange that a television was connected and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.629
 that would allow you to run the games of 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.780
 avoid on a TV with a dual shock 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.990
 and that also allows the remote and with 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.909
 ps4 no less that showed but of course 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.820
 then the drawbacks come and that is 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.070
 it seems those games that 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.979
 use the touch panel to avoid both 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.899
 which is the rear as their own 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.060
 touch screen because they will not be 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.590
 compatible with this device impudence 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.990
 I think fuck because then they are not 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 compatible as this device 90% 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.710
 of avoids games 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.310
 then so you buy the beat atv 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.920
 stem is ok because I think that 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.970
 he also has I do not know what he has 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.390
 exactly as if it were a 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.979
 tuner allows you to watch TV or 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.410
 it is true that you can also enjoy 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.940
 of that 4 remotely thing that 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.540
 It also really allows you to avoid 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.080
 Yes, alone 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.910
 but it's called vita tv 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.800
 its great attraction is supposed to be a 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.580
 the incentive will be to play the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.380
 games avoid 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.460
 clear the positive point of this if 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.140
 really worked well is that this 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.360
 device could be considered as 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.650
 one half of the bottom is really the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.349
 console but in another different format 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.290
 but of course with this with this limitation 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.379
 I do not see any sense that you 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.120
 upload the bat 90% of 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.239
 catalog of life then 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.750
 honestly, no, it does not fit me too much 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.180
 because in addition 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.550
 I believe that there will also be a lot 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.020
 ignorance when buying 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.270
 certain games by a person who at 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.010
 better just have this platform because 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.600
 the best that is imaginary that either 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.340
 the theme of consoles does not matter 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.490
 too much but this has been bought 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.510
 to enjoy a little of all your 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.790
 multimedia possibilities 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.519
 but I say better this person are 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.049
 people do not know what games they used 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.549
 touch panel which does not 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.100
 it means that it is a thing that is a 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.260
 little complicated 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.230
 and that's going to create some bewilderment 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.940
 among the users because I already tell you 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.150
 I think about the catalog that I have of avoiding 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.180
 right now that's about 18 more games or 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.040
 except I think everyone uses the panels 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.590
 to be for the rear as the screen 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.110
 touch and therefore that device 9 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.940
 it would be worth me at least to play 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.880
 habitat games although it is also 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.820
 compatible with psp games 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.990
 the psp game that run guest 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.450
 whole very well the truly given 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.920
 I suppose if you put the card of no 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.320
 it will be different you will be able to download 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.390
 the psp games in the habitat 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.100
 yes yes it would be that more or less than 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.180
 I did not enter much to say either 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.800
 that does not have a reader or instead of 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.870
 this one, but you simply 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.920
 after the blindness and I guess that download 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 the psp games on in this device 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.870
 that imitates life because that will be the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.489
 alternative that he proposes 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.230
 but I do not know if it makes much sense 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.670
 true or how much sense if it were to 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.940
 another thing as I told you before 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.239
 Robert even attractive because it would be 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.610
 how to buy a habitat console but 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.030
 as they have designed it , there is not much 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.030
 sense 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.520
 I do not know how to open my eyes because 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.220
 same as with two of that I had 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.750
 reason that conceptually two of that me 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.400
 It seems like bullshit but it 's true that 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.980
 the machine sure works very well 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.360
 at a commercial level 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.980
 but avoids TV I tried a bit of a 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.260
 I miss a bit weird something 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.380
 that does not finish curdle something that also 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.390
 is incomplete that allows you to enjoy 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.910
 of the catalog to avoid as a whole 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.890
 do not see something attractive from a point 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.900
 from a user's point of view of a 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.460
 player or even from the point of 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.540
 view of a person who also does not have 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.540
 well maybe 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.220
 that has not maybe 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.590
 the craving to play that we can have 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.880
 We do not because, as I told you before 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.860
 maybe it's like the problem of 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.320
 not knowing what games are worth what games do not 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.320
 they are worth 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.960
 so I do not know I wait for your opinion and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.360
 now I say that to me in principle this does not 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.430
 I liked it too, so nothing 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.430
 guys, a little hello and we'll see you goodbye
