don't<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.459> touch<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.879> dumbbells<00:02:14.329> that's<00:02:14.959> an

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109 
don't you touch the dumbbells that's an

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.589 
don't you touch the dumbbells that's an
old-school<00:02:15.500> myth<00:02:16.189> you<00:02:16.430> do<00:02:16.519> not<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.390> touch

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
old-school myth you do not have to touch

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.319 
old-school myth you do not have to touch
the<00:02:17.750> dumbbells<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:18.859> if<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.099> want<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.579> but

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
the dumbbells you can if you want to but

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.780 
the dumbbells you can if you want to but
if<00:02:20.719> you<00:02:20.930> know<00:02:21.049> anything<00:02:21.590> about<00:02:21.680> gravity<00:02:22.400> you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
if you know anything about gravity you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.619 
if you know anything about gravity you
know<00:02:22.969> gravity<00:02:23.329> comes<00:02:23.840> down<00:02:24.310> okay<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.939> once<00:02:26.450> you

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
know gravity comes down okay so once you

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.890 
know gravity comes down okay so once you
pass<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.709> point<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> exercise<00:02:28.900> you're

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
pass this point of the exercise you're

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.750 
pass this point of the exercise you're
not<00:02:30.079> getting<00:02:30.379> any<00:02:30.500> more<00:02:30.650> resistance<00:02:31.189> once<00:02:31.639> you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
not getting any more resistance once you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.729 
not getting any more resistance once you
get<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:31.969> vibe<00:02:32.120> right<00:02:32.150> here<00:02:32.569> that's<00:02:33.260> about<00:02:33.409> all
