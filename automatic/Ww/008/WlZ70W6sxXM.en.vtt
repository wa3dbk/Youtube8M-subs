00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.760 

so<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:27.740> start<00:01:27.950> making<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.280> was<00:01:28.400> out<00:01:28.550> there<00:01:28.790> and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
so we start making it was out there and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.320 
so we start making it was out there and
of<00:01:30.770> course<00:01:31.010> obviously<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:31.970> would<00:01:32.120> leave

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
of course obviously you would leave

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.050 
of course obviously you would leave
space<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:33.050> between<00:01:33.380> these<00:01:33.920> things<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:34.910> your

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
space in between these things for your

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.130 
space in between these things for your
grout<00:01:35.300> lines<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:39.620> it<00:01:39.860> can<00:01:40.010> become<00:01:40.870> its<00:01:41.870> it

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
grout lines and it can become its it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.470 
grout lines and it can become its it
becomes<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.650> really<00:01:43.010> interesting<00:01:43.460> type<00:01:44.270> of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
becomes a really interesting type of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.880 
becomes a really interesting type of
pattern<00:01:44.690> because<00:01:44.990> you've<00:01:45.080> got<00:01:45.230> your<00:01:45.470> strength

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
pattern because you've got your strength

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.670 
pattern because you've got your strength
things<00:01:46.550> over<00:01:46.880> here<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.630> you're<00:01:47.900> going<00:01:48.050> the

things over here and you're going the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.850 
things over here and you're going the
other<00:01:48.710> way<00:01:48.920> there<00:01:50.020> remember<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.230> key<00:01:51.500> thing

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
other way there remember the key thing

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.700 
other way there remember the key thing
is<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.580> background<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.480> don't<00:01:54.170> want<00:01:54.560> to

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
is in the background you don't want to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.980 
is in the background you don't want to
see<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.100> background<00:01:55.520> it's<00:01:56.480> supposed<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.840> be

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
see the background it's supposed to be

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.470 
see the background it's supposed to be
background<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:58.190> background<00:01:58.760> is<00:01:59.000> so

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
background if the background is so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.140 
background if the background is so
bright<00:01:59.720> here<00:02:00.020> did<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.380> obscures<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.920> face<00:02:01.310> and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
bright here did it obscures the face and

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.760 
bright here did it obscures the face and
you<00:02:02.300> not<00:02:02.630> been<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.930> proper<00:02:03.260> job<00:02:03.440> its

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
you not been the proper job its

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.420 
you not been the proper job its
background<00:02:04.210> it's<00:02:05.210> all<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.750> his<00:02:05.900> background

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
background it's all it is his background

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.730 
background it's all it is his background
this<00:02:07.430> also<00:02:08.270> by<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> way<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.200> background

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
this also by the way in background

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.950 
this also by the way in background
sometimes<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:10.490> you<00:02:10.520> do<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.090> use<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.540> solid

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
sometimes what you do is you use a solid

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.070 
sometimes what you do is you use a solid
color<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.640> use<00:02:13.970> black<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.510> lot<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.900> time

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
color so I use black a lot of time

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.810 
color so I use black a lot of time
because<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.350> don't<00:02:15.680> want<00:02:15.770> people<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.520> notice

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
a background in terms of doing that some

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.250 
a background in terms of doing that some
people<00:02:28.820> will<00:02:28.880> do<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> exact<00:02:29.540> opposite<00:02:30.020> make

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260

it all translucent on something like
this<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.020> go<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:34.070> way<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:35.000> an<00:02:35.180> artistic

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
this and go this way it's an artistic

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.170 
this and go this way it's an artistic
idea<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.250> decide<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.030> way<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180

idea but you have to decide the way you
want<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.540> go<00:02:38.600> but<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.530> decide<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.130> want<00:02:40.340> to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
want to go but if you decide you want to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
want to go but if you decide you want to
do<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.360> know<00:02:41.510> see<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.650> would<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:43.459> one

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
do it you know see this would be as one

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.199 
do it you know see this would be as one
piece<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.200> could<00:02:45.530> cut<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.970> it'd<00:02:47.060> be<00:02:47.090> very

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
piece I could cut this but it'd be very

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.010 
piece I could cut this but it'd be very
heavy<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:49.209> artistically<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.480> would<00:02:50.660> be<00:02:50.750> too

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
heavy and artistically it would be too

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.130 
heavy and artistically it would be too
heavy<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:52.400> too<00:02:52.730> perfect<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.930> don't

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
heavy it's too perfect and you don't

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.900 
heavy it's too perfect and you don't
want<00:02:54.890> perfect<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.730> particular

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
want perfect in this particular

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.170 
want perfect in this particular
situation<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:57.739> again<00:02:58.130> when<00:02:58.730> you're<00:02:58.820> doing

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
situation so again when you're doing

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.479 
situation so again when you're doing
you're<00:03:00.170> making<00:03:00.500> your<00:03:00.650> chunks<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:02.750> go<00:03:03.489> small

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
you're making your chunks you go small

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.729 
you're making your chunks you go small
to<00:03:05.180> large<00:03:05.390> like<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.350> then<00:03:06.560> you're<00:03:06.709> just

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
to large like this and then you're just

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.440 
to large like this and then you're just
doing<00:03:07.130> your<00:03:07.310> cuts<00:03:07.670> with<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> think<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.330> can

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
doing your cuts with you think you can

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.940 
doing your cuts with you think you can
make<00:03:08.540> them<00:03:08.690> individually<00:03:08.930> i<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.590> did<00:03:09.709> real

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
make them individually i just did real

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.340 
make them individually i just did real
fast<00:03:10.280> but<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.180> cheap<00:03:11.780> way<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.959> do<00:03:12.230> it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
fast but it's a cheap way to do it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.160 
fast but it's a cheap way to do it
quickly<00:03:12.560> now<00:03:13.070> also<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.940> can<00:03:14.690> do<00:03:14.870> your

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
quickly now also you can do your

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.770 
quickly now also you can do your
background<00:03:15.709> using<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.370> nipper<00:03:16.580> which<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.660> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
background using the nipper which is the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.810

place out in one piece of glass you

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.340 
place out in one piece of glass you
raise<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.190> up<00:03:49.520> away<00:03:49.850> from<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.210> back<00:03:50.450> yes<00:03:50.720> now

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
raise it up away from the back yes now

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.260 
raise it up away from the back yes now
what<00:03:51.620> would<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.830> do<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.520> then<00:03:52.790> have<00:03:53.060> two

what would you do you then have two

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.240 
what would you do you then have two
pieces<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.720> fast<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.350> double<00:03:55.040> thickness

pieces of fast a double thickness

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.760 
pieces of fast a double thickness
wouldn't<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.959> what<00:03:56.959> about<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.290> agent<00:03:57.620> just

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
wouldn't you what about the agent just

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.310 
wouldn't you what about the agent just
leaves<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.250> valued<00:03:58.850> well<00:03:59.420> there's<00:03:59.930> two<00:04:00.140> ways

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
leaves that valued well there's two ways

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.910 
leaves that valued well there's two ways
of<00:04:00.530> thinking<00:04:00.709> about<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:01.430> too<00:04:02.740> that's<00:04:03.740> a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
of thinking about that too that's a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.949 
of thinking about that too that's a
piece<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.160> ass<00:04:08.620> okay<00:04:09.620> when<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.010> do<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.959> on

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
piece of ass okay when you do that on

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.530 
piece of ass okay when you do that on
the<00:04:12.830> grinders<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.640> have<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.940> thing<00:04:14.209> called<00:04:14.240> the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
the grinders you have a thing called the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.159 
the grinders you have a thing called the
jewel<00:04:14.870> jewelry<00:04:15.440> villains<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.419> bevels<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
jewel jewelry villains so it bevels the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.979 
jewel jewelry villains so it bevels the
thing<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.430> it's<00:04:20.060> not<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.299> straight<00:04:20.780> edge

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
thing so that it's not a straight edge

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.680 
thing so that it's not a straight edge
it's<00:04:21.350> rounded<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.040> oh<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.280> see<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.150> gives<00:04:23.510> a

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
it's rounded it oh I see and it gives a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.810 
it's rounded it oh I see and it gives a
very<00:04:23.720> nice<00:04:24.380> effect<00:04:24.800> that's<00:04:25.040> on<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.310> grinder

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
very nice effect that's on the grinder

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.260 
very nice effect that's on the grinder
yeah<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.300> buy<00:04:26.600> believe<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:27.350> del<00:04:28.130> Del<00:04:28.970> find

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
yeah you buy believe I but del Del find

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.940 
yeah you buy believe I but del Del find
the<00:04:29.570> booth<00:04:29.870> all<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.169> way<00:04:30.260> over<00:04:30.470> there<00:04:30.500> is

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
the booth all the way over there is

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.980 
the booth all the way over there is
called<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.340> jewelry<00:04:31.820> grinder<00:04:32.330> there's<00:04:32.780> also

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
called a jewelry grinder there's also

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.890 
called a jewelry grinder there's also
when<00:04:33.290> it's<00:04:33.440> called<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.740> bevel<00:04:34.100> grinder<00:04:34.580> right

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
when it's called a bevel grinder right

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.390 
when it's called a bevel grinder right
so<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:35.990> take<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.380> look<00:04:36.530> at<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.710> until<00:04:37.040> it's

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
so you take a look at it until it's

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.740 
so you take a look at it until it's
specifically<00:04:37.880> bring<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.390> piece<00:04:38.570> of<00:04:38.600> glass

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
specifically bring the piece of glass

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.810 
specifically bring the piece of glass
and<00:04:38.930> say<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.830> know<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:39.979> want<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.400> have<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.669> as<00:04:40.790> a

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
and say you know I want to have it as a

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.870 
and say you know I want to have it as a
double<00:04:41.300> edge<00:04:41.600> oh<00:04:42.050> yes<00:04:42.500> which<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.310> your<00:04:43.460> grinder

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
double edge oh yes which of your grinder

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.630 
double edge oh yes which of your grinder
bits<00:04:44.180> would<00:04:44.419> in<00:04:44.570> turn<00:04:44.750> Julia<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:45.640> therefore

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
bits would in turn Julia and therefore

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.909 
bits would in turn Julia and therefore
they're<00:04:46.790> not<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.270> edge<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
they're not that edge of the to the

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.850 
they're not that edge of the to the
truth<00:04:49.160> about<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.640> face<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.390> solid

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
truth about the face and the solid

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.469 
truth about the face and the solid
raised<00:04:51.860> fish<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.400> would<00:04:52.550> bever<00:04:52.790> both<00:04:53.150> pieces

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
raised fish you would bever both pieces

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.750 
raised fish you would bever both pieces
so<00:04:53.930> there<00:04:54.140> would<00:04:54.260> be<00:04:54.290> nice<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.860> smooth<00:04:55.160> now

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
so there would be nice and smooth now

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.360 
so there would be nice and smooth now
what<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.690> finished<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.440> piece<00:04:57.800> which<00:04:58.340> is

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
what I just finished a piece which is

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.800 
what I just finished a piece which is
three<00:04:58.760> levels<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:01.010> but<00:05:01.669> it<00:05:01.790> had<00:05:01.970> as<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.390> have<00:05:02.780> a

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
three levels and but it had as I have a

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.340 
three levels and but it had as I have a
face<00:05:03.620> gets<00:05:03.890> called<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.220> Oracle<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:06.050> did

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
face gets called the Oracle and I did

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.800 
face gets called the Oracle and I did
this<00:05:06.440> in<00:05:06.650> wood<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.270> have<00:05:08.390> my<00:05:08.540> wood

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
this in wood so I have my wood

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.340 
this in wood so I have my wood
background<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.669> have<00:05:10.669> my<00:05:10.880> face<00:05:11.210> online<00:05:12.140> and

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
background I have my face online and

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.980 
background I have my face online and
would<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.800> put<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.520> second<00:05:14.030> word<00:05:14.180> on<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:14.750> I

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
would I put a second word on it and I

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.050 
would I put a second word on it and I
put<00:05:15.229> a<00:05:15.260> third<00:05:15.590> word<00:05:15.860> on<00:05:15.979> it<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:16.580> he<00:05:16.610> faced

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
put a third word on it so he faced

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.659 
put a third word on it so he faced
really<00:05:18.050> jumps<00:05:18.470> out<00:05:18.530> like<00:05:19.010> this<00:05:19.220> the

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
really jumps out like this the

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.750 
really jumps out like this the
background<00:05:20.270> is<00:05:20.450> all<00:05:20.479> submerged<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.800> then<00:05:22.729> I

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
background is all submerged and then I

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.380 
background is all submerged and then I
have<00:05:23.180> he's<00:05:23.870> on<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.200> path<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.880> path<00:05:25.910> is

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
have he's on a path and the path is

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.020 
have he's on a path and the path is
second

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
second

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.780 
second
so<00:05:28.030> here<00:05:28.570> I<00:05:28.600> here<00:05:28.990> have<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:29.590> monk<00:05:29.920> going<00:05:30.580> to

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
so here I here have this monk going to

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.060 
so here I here have this monk going to
see<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.150> Oracle<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.500> he's<00:05:32.680> like<00:05:32.830> it's

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
see the Oracle and so he's like it's

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.190 
see the Oracle and so he's like it's
coming<00:05:33.430> down<00:05:33.580> from<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.090> smileys<00:05:34.660> going<00:05:35.020> up

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
coming down from the smileys going up

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.480 
coming down from the smileys going up
and<00:05:35.410> then<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.620> have<00:05:35.860> this<00:05:35.980> big<00:05:36.280> monstrous

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
and then you have this big monstrous

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.690 
and then you have this big monstrous
Oracle<00:05:37.480> type<00:05:37.690> of<00:05:37.870> thing<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.200> I<00:05:38.830> use<00:05:39.040> no

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
Oracle type of thing and I use no

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.930 
Oracle type of thing and I use no
straight<00:05:40.420> lines<00:05:40.630> all<00:05:40.960> little<00:05:41.770> tiny<00:05:42.310> pieces<00:05:42.460> of

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
straight lines all little tiny pieces of

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.310 
straight lines all little tiny pieces of
like<00:05:43.510> confetti<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.560> make<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.860> Oracle<00:05:45.310> oh<00:05:46.320> it's

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
like confetti to make the Oracle oh it's

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.970 
like confetti to make the Oracle oh it's
one<00:05:47.530> of<00:05:47.650> my<00:05:47.740> most<00:05:47.950> successful<00:05:48.190> failures<00:05:49.980> it's

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
one of my most successful failures it's

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.430 
one of my most successful failures it's
nice<00:05:51.190> for<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.490> deputy<00:05:52.150> turn<00:05:52.840> out<00:05:52.990> like<00:05:53.230> way

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
nice for the deputy turn out like way

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.830 
nice for the deputy turn out like way
alive<00:05:53.680> but<00:05:54.190> with<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.730> lives<00:05:54.940> of<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.540> face

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
alive but with the lives of that face

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.470 
alive but with the lives of that face
perhaps<00:05:56.770> you<00:05:57.040> can<00:05:57.220> also<00:05:57.400> with<00:05:57.880> your<00:05:58.060> solid

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
perhaps you can also with your solid

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.800 
perhaps you can also with your solid
piece<00:05:58.690> of<00:05:58.870> glass<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.140> you're<00:05:59.530> using
