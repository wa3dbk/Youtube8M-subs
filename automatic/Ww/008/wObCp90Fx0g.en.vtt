that there's other intelligent life than
this<00:00:49.440> vast<00:00:49.649> universe<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.309> think<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> lack

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
this vast universe I think that's a lack

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.850 
this vast universe I think that's a lack
of<00:00:51.870> imagination

of imagination

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.569 
trouble I know there are alien craft
here<00:01:50.479> from<00:01:51.479> another<00:01:51.689> planet<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.220> saw

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
here from another planet I know I saw

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.030 
here from another planet I know I saw
other<00:01:53.820> ones<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.390> was<00:01:54.630> inside<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.799> know

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
other ones but I was inside one I know

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
other ones but I was inside one I know
it<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.790> made<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.210> earth<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.259> was

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it was not made on earth I know it was

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.950 
it was not made on earth I know it was
made<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.649> materials<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.670> cannot

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
made with materials that we cannot

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.899 
made with materials that we cannot
fabricate<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.530> cannot<00:02:01.710> duplicate<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.700> we've

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
fabricate we cannot duplicate and we've

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.940 
fabricate we cannot duplicate and we've
never<00:02:03.210> been<00:02:03.360> able<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.140> know<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.560> uses<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
never been able to I know it uses a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.789 
never been able to I know it uses a
power<00:02:05.159> source<00:02:05.549> that's<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.509> advanced<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.409> we

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
power source that's so advanced that we

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
power source that's so advanced that we
could<00:02:08.129> only<00:02:08.220> dream<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:09.060> something<00:02:09.450> along

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
could only dream of something along

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960 
could only dream of something along
those<00:02:09.989> lines<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.860> energy<00:02:11.220> density<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
those lines and the energy density on it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.230 
those lines and the energy density on it
is

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.050 
is
phenomenal<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.410> nothing<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.160> would

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
phenomenal that's nothing that I would

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.240 
phenomenal that's nothing that I would
ever<00:02:15.090> expect<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:16.020> now<00:02:16.410> maybe<00:02:16.650> now<00:02:16.890> people

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
ever expect to see now maybe now people

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.120 
ever expect to see now maybe now people
are<00:02:17.340> more<00:02:17.580> open<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> idea<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:19.650> there<00:02:19.920> are

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
are more open to the idea that there are

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.880 
are more open to the idea that there are
extra<00:02:20.730> intelligent<00:02:21.570> extra<00:02:21.930> life<00:02:22.230> most<00:02:22.470> likely

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
extra intelligent extra life most likely

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.590 
extra intelligent extra life most likely
throughout<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> universe<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:24.330> here's<00:02:24.540> a

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
throughout the universe but here's a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.470 
throughout the universe but here's a
sticking<00:02:25.080> point<00:02:25.400> are<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:26.850> visiting<00:02:27.470> here
