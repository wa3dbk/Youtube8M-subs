can't<00:03:45.520> really<00:03:45.820> seem<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.060> much<00:03:46.390> yet<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:46.960> when

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
can't really seem that much yet but when

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.840 
can't really seem that much yet but when
we<00:03:48.640> we've<00:03:49.480> done<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.900> other<00:03:50.080> panels<00:03:50.850> the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
we we've done the other panels the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.670 
we we've done the other panels the
effect<00:03:52.240> will<00:03:52.450> really<00:03:52.780> come<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.110> life<00:03:53.260> it's

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
effect will really come to life it's

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.870 
effect will really come to life it's
very<00:03:53.950> subtle<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:55.480> haven't<00:03:56.380> been<00:03:56.500> doing<00:03:57.490> all<00:03:57.760> the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
very subtle I haven't been doing all the

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.790 
very subtle I haven't been doing all the
way<00:03:58.000> with<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.330> colors<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.930> could<00:03:59.110> go<00:03:59.320> very

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
way with the colors you could go very

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.920 
way with the colors you could go very
light<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.220> very<00:04:00.610> dark<00:04:01.120> with<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:04.480> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
light and very dark with this but I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.350 
light and very dark with this but I
think<00:04:05.410> this<00:04:06.070> will<00:04:06.250> be<00:04:06.310> enough<00:04:06.460> end<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.210> when

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
think this will be enough end and when

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.180 
think this will be enough end and when
we<00:04:07.480> we've<00:04:08.260> weathered<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:09.310> Walker<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:11.200> think

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
we we've weathered the Walker I think

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.730 
we we've weathered the Walker I think
this<00:04:12.370> will<00:04:12.580> give<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> very<00:04:13.690> nice<00:04:13.990> effect<00:04:14.470> and

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
this will give a very nice effect and

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.010 
this will give a very nice effect and
the<00:04:14.770> contrast<00:04:15.700> between<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.180> colors<00:04:16.540> won't<00:04:16.840> be

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
the contrast between the colors won't be

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.850 
the contrast between the colors won't be
as<00:04:17.140> stark<00:04:17.560> as<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:18.130> now<00:04:19.200> which<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.320> like<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.530> bit

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
as stark as it is now which I like a bit

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.060 
as stark as it is now which I like a bit
better<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:23.550> I'll<00:04:24.550> finish<00:04:25.090> this<00:04:25.680> one<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.920> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
better so I'll finish this one and the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.400 
better so I'll finish this one and the
rest<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.430> then<00:04:27.610> I'll<00:04:27.760> get<00:04:27.910> back<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.120> you

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
rest and then I'll get back to you

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.570 
rest and then I'll get back to you
choose

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.230 

okay<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.470> here's<00:04:34.470> my<00:04:34.560> results

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.220 

the<00:04:40.690> right<00:04:40.930> night<00:04:41.259> you<00:04:41.530> can<00:04:41.770> see

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.410 

how<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.830> gradients<00:04:46.610> work

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:57.150 

besides<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.670> bit<00:04:51.850> more<00:04:52.090> obvious

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.900 

that<00:04:57.430> should<00:04:57.730> give<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.030> very<00:04:58.630> nice<00:04:58.960> effect

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
that should give a very nice effect

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.760 
that should give a very nice effect
