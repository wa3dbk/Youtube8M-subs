00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
oh my name is Lucas hopper and I just

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.580 
oh my name is Lucas hopper and I just
want<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.639> quick<00:00:11.849> video<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.750> linear

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
want to do a quick video on my linear

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.120 
want to do a quick video on my linear
actuator

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
actuator

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.769 
actuator
I've<00:00:14.700> made<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.690> red<00:00:15.719> m4<00:00:16.710> man<00:00:17.779> well

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I've made the one in red m4 man well

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.830 
I've made the one in red m4 man well
first<00:00:19.500> thing<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.039> um<00:00:20.580> well<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.480> set<00:00:21.750> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
first thing is um well we just set it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.150 
first thing is um well we just set it
apart<00:00:22.109> from<00:00:22.170> other<00:00:22.380> than<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.710> actuators

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
apart from other than your actuators

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.599 
apart from other than your actuators
I've<00:00:23.490> seen<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.570> allows<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.220> direct

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
I've seen is it allows to you the direct

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.029 
I've seen is it allows to you the direct
mounting<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.029> MU<00:00:27.269> 17<00:00:27.779> motor<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
mounting of MU 17 motor that is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.130 
mounting of MU 17 motor that is
something<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:29.699> nice<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.240> there's<00:00:30.990> no

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
something very nice because there's no

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.860 
something very nice because there's no
need<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> buy<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> coupling<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.870> mean

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
need for you to buy a coupling I mean

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.900 
need for you to buy a coupling I mean
there<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.920> cheap<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> 3d<00:00:35.820> print

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
there are not that cheap we can 3d print

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
there are not that cheap we can 3d print
on<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:37.020> look<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.290> well<00:00:37.469> okay

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
on that they don't look as well okay

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.799 
on that they don't look as well okay
also<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.670> saves<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.149> rooms<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
also it saves a lot of rooms this is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.580 
also it saves a lot of rooms this is
very<00:00:40.230> compact<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.559> quite<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
very compact and then you have quite a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.319 
very compact and then you have quite a
few<00:00:43.649> 3d<00:00:44.100> printed<00:00:44.370> parts<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.850> project

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
few 3d printed parts on this project

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.600 
few 3d printed parts on this project
you've<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.379> blocks<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.309> called

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you've got the and blocks as I called

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
you've got the and blocks as I called
them<00:00:47.969> you've<00:00:48.570> got<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> sled<00:00:49.320> his<00:00:49.950> sleigh

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
table maybe I didn't really know what

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
table maybe I didn't really know what
you<00:00:52.800> saved<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> armature<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.660> yeah<00:00:55.010> another

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you saved this armature now yeah another

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.740 
you saved this armature now yeah another
one<00:00:56.190> right<00:00:56.430> there

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
one right there

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
cause well now let's start with the M

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
cause well now let's start with the M
and<00:01:03.030> plates<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.350> oh<00:01:04.589> there's<00:01:05.159> these

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and plates you see oh there's these

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.820 
and plates you see oh there's these
mounting<00:01:05.820> brackets<00:01:06.180> I've<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.320> four<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> those

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
mounting brackets I've got four of those

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
mounting brackets I've got four of those
to<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.340> side<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.020> side

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to me side with you on the other side

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.240 
to me side with you on the other side
and<00:01:11.600> they<00:01:12.600> allow<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.439> tighten<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> belt

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and they allow you to tighten the belt

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060 
and they allow you to tighten the belt
by<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.390> unscrewing<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.920> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
by just unscrewing those they go into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
by just unscrewing those they go into
the<00:01:17.220> ultimate<00:01:17.610> profile<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.540> then

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the ultimate profile right here then

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.609 
the ultimate profile right here then
just<00:01:19.200> sort<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:20.390> another<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.619> love

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
just sort out another that I love

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.050 
just sort out another that I love
something<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:24.060> neat<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:25.939> I'm<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
something really neat and I'm a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
something really neat and I'm a
wondering<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> mode<00:01:28.200> who<00:01:28.380> sticks<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
wondering how this mode who sticks to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
wondering how this mode who sticks to
this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.700> screwed<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.320> I'm<00:01:31.320> going

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
this is actually screwed and I'm going

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.249 
this is actually screwed and I'm going
to<00:01:31.890> demonstrate<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.490> by<00:01:32.549> M<00:01:33.079> show<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to demonstrate this by M show you the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
to demonstrate this by M show you the
old<00:01:34.409> prototype<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.700> actual<00:01:35.850> design

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
old prototype is in the actual design

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.530 
old prototype is in the actual design
that<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> hip<00:01:37.560> today<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> used

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that is hip today but just what I used

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.440 
that is hip today but just what I used
and<00:01:40.229> what<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and what you do is you have this this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270 
and what you do is you have this this
thing<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:43.020> ever<00:01:43.200> did<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.040> end

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
thing we ever did was one of these end

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.749 
thing we ever did was one of these end
plates<00:01:45.200> one<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:47.159> those<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
plates one here you can see those you

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.580 
plates one here you can see those you
can<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.420> four<00:01:48.960> holes<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
can kind of see those four holes and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.020 
can kind of see those four holes and
they're<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.869> those<00:01:52.350> M<00:01:52.829> those<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
they're right and those M those the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.050 
they're right and those M those the
screw<00:01:54.360> tops<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.130> slide<00:01:56.640> into

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
screw tops but they they just slide into

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
screw tops but they they just slide into
it<00:01:57.110> we're<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> demonstrate<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.340> maybe

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it we're going to demonstrate that maybe

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.789 
it we're going to demonstrate that maybe
maybe<00:02:00.360> always<00:02:01.170> taste<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.530> little

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
maybe always taste a little

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.319 
maybe always taste a little
oh<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:05.070> nearly<00:02:05.310> lost<00:02:05.549> one<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> those<00:02:05.939> screws

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
oh it's nearly lost one of those screws

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.399 
oh it's nearly lost one of those screws
there<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> go

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
there you go

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.450 
there you go
so<00:02:08.310> I've<00:02:08.520> lost<00:02:08.940> one

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
so I've lost one

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.850 
so I've lost one
but<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.480> it's<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:10.750> certain<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.500> in

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
but the you it's just certain it's in

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.030 
but the you it's just certain it's in
there<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:13.960> can<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.290> mount<00:02:14.530> NEMA<00:02:14.920> 17

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
there then you can just mount NEMA 17

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.040 
there then you can just mount NEMA 17
onto<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.360> regular<00:02:16.660> one<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.840> just

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
onto it like the regular one I just

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.250 
onto it like the regular one I just
goose<00:02:17.230> drop<00:02:17.650> them<00:02:17.830> there<00:02:18.040> well<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:20.050> thing<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
goose drop them there well the thing is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.650 
goose drop them there well the thing is
you<00:02:20.470> he<00:02:20.770> first<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.820> would<00:02:21.940> test<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.300> motor<00:02:22.450> to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
you he first you would test the motor to

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.030 
you he first you would test the motor to
the<00:02:22.690> plate<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.200> then<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.410> would<00:02:23.710> drop<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the plate and then you would drop the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.740 
the plate and then you would drop the
plate<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:25.710> well<00:02:26.710> yeah<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.660> have

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
plate in and well yeah I think you have

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.590 
plate in and well yeah I think you have
common<00:02:29.050> sense<00:02:29.320> but<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:31.120> use<00:02:31.240> common<00:02:31.450> sense

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
common sense but you use common sense

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.930 
common sense but you use common sense
that<00:02:31.900> at<00:02:32.080> least<00:02:32.230> modern<00:02:32.590> ideas<00:02:32.890> some<00:02:33.580> out<00:02:33.880> of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
that at least modern ideas some out of

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.940 
that at least modern ideas some out of
the<00:02:34.150> amplitude<00:02:34.510> made<00:02:34.960> quite<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.290> few<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.770> those

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the amplitude made quite a few of those

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.360 
the amplitude made quite a few of those
so<00:02:36.670> generally<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.830> wanted<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> whole

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
so generally I wanted to do a whole

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.070 
so generally I wanted to do a whole
project<00:02:39.850> with<00:02:39.970> those<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.720> through<00:02:40.960> you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
project with those like through you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.840 
project with those like through you
print<00:02:41.320> up<00:02:43.110> never<00:02:44.110> mind

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.310 

well<00:02:48.850> now<00:02:49.030> let's<00:02:49.330> just<00:02:49.570> compare<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
well now let's just compare this to the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.520 
well now let's just compare this to the
one<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.830> see<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.490> background<00:02:52.210> here<00:02:52.530> hey

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
one you see in the background here hey

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.210 
one you see in the background here hey
sailor<00:02:53.950> oh<00:02:54.150> that's<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.420> lucky<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.590> BAE<00:02:56.740> find<00:02:57.070> as

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
sailor oh that's a lucky you BAE find as

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.060 
sailor oh that's a lucky you BAE find as
I<00:02:57.310> recall<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.790> I've<00:02:57.940> got<00:02:58.150> those<00:02:58.330> for<00:02:58.800> 50<00:02:59.800> quid

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
I recall it I've got those for 50 quid

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.780 
I recall it I've got those for 50 quid
which<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.810> very<00:03:01.810> very<00:03:02.080> cheap<00:03:02.350> it's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
which is very very cheap it's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.640 
which is very very cheap it's
high-quality<00:03:03.790> linear<00:03:04.540> actuators<00:03:05.110> by<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.320> guess

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
high-quality linear actuators by I guess

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.240 
high-quality linear actuators by I guess

Germany<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.720> uses<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.230> same<00:03:08.520> very<00:03:09.520> same

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
Germany and it uses the same very same

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.570 
Germany and it uses the same very same
than<00:03:10.990> your<00:03:11.170> slide<00:03:11.380> system<00:03:11.830> as<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.250> one<00:03:12.400> I've

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
than your slide system as the one I've

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.490 
than your slide system as the one I've
made<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:14.110> inspired<00:03:14.530> me<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.830> use<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.190> and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
made this inspired me to use this and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.530 
made this inspired me to use this and
the<00:03:17.500> thing<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.400> looks<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.360> it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the thing is it just looks so not it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.440 
the thing is it just looks so not it
cooks<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:19.960> mechanical<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.650> all<00:03:20.770> metal<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:22.090> I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
cooks in mechanical it's all metal but I

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.560 
cooks in mechanical it's all metal but I
mean<00:03:22.930> 600<00:03:23.860> quid<00:03:24.070> if<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:24.970> were<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.120> get<00:03:25.330> one<00:03:25.480> of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
mean 600 quid if you were to get one of

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.540 
mean 600 quid if you were to get one of
those<00:03:25.720> while<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.530> can<00:03:26.680> get<00:03:26.830> but<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.250> can<00:03:27.430> make

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
those while you can get but I can make

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.690 
those while you can get but I can make
this<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.690> thing<00:03:29.400> including<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.430> motor

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
this this thing including the motor

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.250 
this this thing including the motor
mount<00:03:30.970> for<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.720> will<00:03:31.840> need<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.020> motor

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
mount for this you will need a motor

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.850 
mount for this you will need a motor
mount<00:03:32.560> which<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.430> probably<00:03:33.940> going<00:03:34.090> over<00:03:34.360> here

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
mount which is probably going over here

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.820 
mount which is probably going over here
or<00:03:35.860> at<00:03:36.340> least<00:03:36.520> one<00:03:36.700> little<00:03:36.910> bit<00:03:37.000> more<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
or at least one little bit more you can

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.190 
or at least one little bit more you can
do<00:03:38.950> this<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.430> directly<00:03:39.850> murder<00:03:40.390> for<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:41.020> think

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
do this and directly murder for I think

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.540 
do this and directly murder for I think
80<00:03:41.650> bucks<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.600> very<00:03:44.050> very<00:03:44.230> cheap<00:03:45.660> no

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
80 bucks and that is very very cheap no

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.390 
80 bucks and that is very very cheap no
well<00:03:48.550> let's<00:03:49.240> just<00:03:49.480> see<00:03:49.990> let's<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:51.100> focus<00:03:51.250> on

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
well let's just see let's just focus on

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.490 
well let's just see let's just focus on
this<00:03:51.520> part<00:03:51.580> because<00:03:52.450> well<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.930> suppose<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.380> the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
this part because well I suppose to the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.990 
this part because well I suppose to the
de<00:03:53.680> linear<00:03:53.920> bearings<00:03:54.250> attached<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.820> and

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
de linear bearings attached to it and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.600 
de linear bearings attached to it and
the<00:03:55.840> belt<00:03:56.020> let's<00:03:56.650> just<00:03:56.830> show<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.040> all<00:03:57.400> the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
the belt let's just show you all the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.480 
the belt let's just show you all the
Bluebell<00:03:58.090> attaches<00:03:58.570> into<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:59.350> an<00:03:59.920> interesting

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
Bluebell attaches into it an interesting

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.490 
Bluebell attaches into it an interesting
manner<00:04:00.820> as<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:01.570> shall<00:04:01.780> demonstrate<00:04:01.960> right<00:04:02.440> now

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
manner as I shall demonstrate right now

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.710 
manner as I shall demonstrate right now
and<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:04.030> develops

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
and this develops

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.790 
and this develops
Jiki<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.530> come<00:04:05.890> bail<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.660> do<00:04:07.960> is<00:04:08.230> um

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
Jiki to come bail you what you do is um

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.470 
Jiki to come bail you what you do is um
well<00:04:09.490> now<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:09.880> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.150> be<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.300> bit

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
well now that's going to be a bit

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.820 
well now that's going to be a bit
complicated<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:12.340> just<00:04:13.170> fold<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.320> over<00:04:14.500> like

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
complicated you just fold it over like

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.310 
complicated you just fold it over like
this<00:04:15.750> then<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:17.410> just

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
this then you just

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.880 
this then you just
on<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.500> show<00:04:19.270> so<00:04:20.270> now<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:21.050> see<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.470> fluid

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
on the show so now you see the fluid

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.100 
on the show so now you see the fluid
what's<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.460> right<00:04:22.580> way<00:04:22.820> now<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.420> just<00:04:23.810> push

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
what's the right way now you just push

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.130 
what's the right way now you just push
it<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.680> through<00:04:25.430> those<00:04:25.610> holes<00:04:26.140> there's

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
it in and through those holes there's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.250 
it in and through those holes there's
any<00:04:27.350> what<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.620> do<00:04:27.770> is<00:04:27.950> just<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.640> it<00:04:29.140> plug<00:04:30.140> it

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
any what you do is just do it plug it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.420 
any what you do is just do it plug it
into<00:04:30.380> there<00:04:30.620> then<00:04:30.950> pull<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:31.820> out<00:04:31.970> right<00:04:33.430> and

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
into there then pull it out right and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.310 
into there then pull it out right and
just<00:04:34.640> like<00:04:34.700> this<00:04:35.000> then<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.600> just<00:04:35.810> pull<00:04:36.290> it

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
just like this then you just pull it

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.920 
just like this then you just pull it
over<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:37.010> oh<00:04:39.310> boy<00:04:40.310> I'm<00:04:40.460> sorry<00:04:40.790> about<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.270> bye

over and oh boy I'm sorry about this bye

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.660 
over and oh boy I'm sorry about this bye
I<00:04:41.960> need<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:42.380> hold<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.620> camera<00:04:42.830> in<00:04:43.040> some<00:04:43.370> sort

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
I need to hold the camera in some sort

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.240 
I need to hold the camera in some sort
of<00:04:43.700> way<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> don't<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:44.990> just<00:04:45.020> just<00:04:45.500> goes<00:04:45.890> back

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
of way I don't it just just goes back

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.520 
of way I don't it just just goes back
into<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.760> then<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:47.690> just<00:04:47.900> put<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.350> screw

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
into it then you just put a screw

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.440 
into it then you just put a screw
through<00:04:48.890> there<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.430> if<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.670> want<00:04:49.880> for<00:04:50.240> extra

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
through there and if you want for extra

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.170 
through there and if you want for extra
security<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:51.290> another<00:04:51.530> c-couldn't<00:04:51.770> back<00:04:52.180> now

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
security but another c-couldn't back now

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.250 
security but another c-couldn't back now
as<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:54.080> told<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.800> this<00:04:55.070> isn't<00:04:55.430> da<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.840> final

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
as I told you this isn't da the final

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.620 
as I told you this isn't da the final
and<00:04:57.530> block<00:04:57.950> design<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:59.240> can<00:04:59.420> tell

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
and block design and you can tell

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.470 
and block design and you can tell
because<00:05:00.410> well<00:05:01.010> as<00:05:01.250> first<00:05:01.490> as<00:05:01.790> you<00:05:01.880> can<00:05:02.000> see<00:05:02.150> it

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
because well as first as you can see it

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.300 
because well as first as you can see it
took<00:05:02.690> quite<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.260> lot<00:05:03.500> of<00:05:03.620> rework<00:05:04.070> with

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
took quite a lot of rework with

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.800 
took quite a lot of rework with
sandpaper<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.330> knife<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:08.330> was<00:05:08.540> because

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
sandpaper and knife and that was because

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.570 
sandpaper and knife and that was because
if<00:05:09.260> you're<00:05:09.590> three<00:05:09.710> different<00:05:10.040> parts<00:05:10.370> they

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
if you're three different parts they

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.240 
if you're three different parts they
always<00:05:11.000> if<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:12.050> do<00:05:12.170> circle<00:05:12.650> they<00:05:12.860> they're

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
always if you do circle they they're

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.210 
always if you do circle they they're
never<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.850> size<00:05:14.230> this<00:05:15.230> is<00:05:15.290> just<00:05:15.710> this<00:05:15.920> voice<00:05:16.190> I

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
never to size this is just this voice I

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.670 
never to size this is just this voice I
think<00:05:16.520> half<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.910> mil<00:05:17.210> too<00:05:17.420> small<00:05:17.990> what<00:05:18.560> I've

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
think half a mil too small what I've

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.770 
think half a mil too small what I've
done<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:19.010> I've<00:05:19.220> extended<00:05:19.820> that<00:05:20.120> diameter

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
done is I've extended that diameter

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.240 
done is I've extended that diameter
diameter<00:05:21.140> like<00:05:22.070> about<00:05:22.340> one<00:05:22.820> millimeter<00:05:23.270> and

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
diameter like about one millimeter and

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.010 
diameter like about one millimeter and
then<00:05:25.250> one<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.120> them<00:05:26.270> I<00:05:26.450> thought<00:05:26.750> was<00:05:26.900> very

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
then one of them I thought was very

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.900 
then one of them I thought was very
clever<00:05:27.290> as<00:05:27.830> if<00:05:28.190> if<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:28.400> have<00:05:28.550> VA

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
clever as if if you have VA

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.950 
clever as if if you have VA
alright<00:05:29.840> there<00:05:30.350> something<00:05:31.130> like<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.960> that

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
alright there something like this that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.980 
alright there something like this that
was<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.230> hole<00:05:33.410> then<00:05:33.980> I<00:05:34.190> have<00:05:34.370> mounted<00:05:35.000> nothing

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
was the hole then I have mounted nothing

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.710 
was the hole then I have mounted nothing
this<00:05:36.200> got<00:05:36.620> three<00:05:36.980> of<00:05:37.130> those<00:05:37.450> when<00:05:38.450> they<00:05:38.630> are

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
this got three of those when they are

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.410 
this got three of those when they are
only<00:05:38.930> half<00:05:39.320> a<00:05:39.410> millimeter<00:05:40.000> now<00:05:41.000> you<00:05:41.060> can<00:05:41.300> just

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
only half a millimeter now you can just

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.150 
only half a millimeter now you can just
put<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.780> bearing<00:05:42.140> in<00:05:42.290> there<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:43.040> it<00:05:43.130> just

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
put the bearing in there and it just

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.090 
put the bearing in there and it just
sits<00:05:43.670> very<00:05:43.940> nice<00:05:44.260> because<00:05:45.260> it's<00:05:45.410> defined<00:05:45.980> by

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
sits very nice because it's defined by

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.530 
sits very nice because it's defined by
their<00:05:46.340> three<00:05:46.550> points<00:05:47.620> but<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:48.740> can<00:05:48.890> easily

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
their three points but you can easily

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.570 
their three points but you can easily
get<00:05:50.540> it<00:05:50.630> out<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:50.900> block<00:05:51.080> which<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.860> couldn't<00:05:52.220> so

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
get it out of block which I couldn't so

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.820 
get it out of block which I couldn't so
I<00:05:52.610> needed<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.120> drill<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.840> sole<00:05:54.080> right<00:05:54.560> here

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
I needed to drill the sole right here

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.460 
I needed to drill the sole right here
this<00:05:55.070> is<00:05:55.280> also<00:05:55.910> optional<00:05:56.470> is<00:05:57.470> missing<00:05:58.420> no

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
this is also optional is missing no

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.470 
this is also optional is missing no
future<00:06:00.470> design<00:06:00.770> answer<00:06:01.040> and<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.670> a<00:06:01.700> an

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
future design answer and this is a an

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.510 
future design answer and this is a an
evolving<00:06:02.870> product<00:06:03.260> it's<00:06:03.560> not<00:06:03.710> finished<00:06:04.310> yet

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
evolving product it's not finished yet

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.960 
evolving product it's not finished yet
but<00:06:04.790> it<00:06:04.910> works<00:06:05.180> very<00:06:05.420> nice<00:06:06.580> things<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.730> wanted

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
but it works very nice things I wanted

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.420 
but it works very nice things I wanted
to<00:06:08.030> do<00:06:08.210> is<00:06:08.480> I<00:06:08.720> may<00:06:09.320> want<00:06:09.560> to<00:06:09.740> integrate<00:06:09.980> one<00:06:10.370> of

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
to do is I may want to integrate one of

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.880 
to do is I may want to integrate one of
those<00:06:10.610> n<00:06:11.090> switches<00:06:11.630> in<00:06:12.080> there<00:06:12.620> because<00:06:12.800> that

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
those n switches in there because that

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.520 
those n switches in there because that
would<00:06:13.100> be<00:06:13.190> neat<00:06:13.690> maybe<00:06:14.690> something<00:06:15.080> like<00:06:15.290> this

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
would be neat maybe something like this

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.420 
would be neat maybe something like this
and<00:06:15.770> then<00:06:15.860> you<00:06:15.950> have<00:06:16.040> an<00:06:16.160> angle<00:06:17.140> like<00:06:18.140> so<00:06:18.430> you

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
and then you have an angle like so you

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.670 
and then you have an angle like so you
just<00:06:19.580> have<00:06:19.910> something<00:06:20.120> that<00:06:20.420> I<00:06:20.660> don't<00:06:21.260> mean<00:06:21.500> it

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
just have something that I don't mean it

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.670 
just have something that I don't mean it
and<00:06:22.300> also<00:06:23.300> what<00:06:23.750> I'm<00:06:23.870> soon<00:06:24.080> going<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.350> do<00:06:24.500> is

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
and also what I'm soon going to do is

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.020 
and also what I'm soon going to do is
I'm<00:06:24.950> going<00:06:25.160> to<00:06:25.250> upload<00:06:25.610> a<00:06:25.880> bit

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
I'm going to upload a bit

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.870 
I'm going to upload a bit
and<00:06:27.590> truly<00:06:28.590> want<00:06:28.890> to<00:06:28.980> represent<00:06:29.190> three

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
and truly want to represent three

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.130 
and truly want to represent three
printed<00:06:30.240> thing<00:06:30.510> which<00:06:31.100> actually<00:06:32.930> means<00:06:33.930> that

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
printed thing which actually means that

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.870 
printed thing which actually means that
you<00:06:34.290> don't<00:06:34.410> have<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:34.860> use<00:06:35.040> those<00:06:35.250> metal<00:06:35.640> plates

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
you don't have to use those metal plates

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.640 
you don't have to use those metal plates
which<00:06:36.090> i<00:06:36.510> think<00:06:36.630> is<00:06:37.170> channeling<00:06:37.500> it<00:06:39.200> yeah

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.190 

well<00:06:43.650> that's<00:06:44.310> it<00:06:44.790> I<00:06:44.820> guess<00:06:45.240> from<00:06:45.600> my<00:06:45.780> linear

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
well that's it I guess from my linear

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.560 
well that's it I guess from my linear
actuator<00:06:46.920> if<00:06:47.460> you<00:06:47.580> want<00:06:47.730> to<00:06:47.820> see<00:06:47.970> it<00:06:48.060> crash<00:06:48.300> I

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
actuator if you want to see it crash I

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:56.590 
actuator if you want to see it crash I
may<00:06:48.980> turn<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.160> power<00:06:50.370> on<00:06:50.430> one<00:06:50.760> more<00:06:50.880> time

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.120 

well<00:06:57.600> yeah<00:06:57.780> let's<00:06:58.460> buy<00:06:59.460> and<00:06:59.850> oh<00:07:00.860> make<00:07:01.860> one<00:07:02.040> of

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
well yeah let's buy and oh make one of

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.910 
well yeah let's buy and oh make one of
those<00:07:02.280> they<00:07:02.580> are<00:07:02.640> great
