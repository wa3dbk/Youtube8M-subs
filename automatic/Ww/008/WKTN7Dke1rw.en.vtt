00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
far as wrestling Jones I mean he hasn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.400 
far as wrestling Jones I mean he hasn't

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
been to dub UW for a couple of years ago

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.750 
been to dub UW for a couple of years ago
but<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.650> mean<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> guy<00:02:29.010> has<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.640> good

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
but I mean the guy has really good

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.420 
but I mean the guy has really good
wrestling<00:02:30.150> skills<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.860> was<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.160> very

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
wrestling skills and I was just very

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.130 
wrestling skills and I was just very
surprised<00:02:32.850> at<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.209> he<00:02:33.540> did<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
surprised at how good he did in the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.199 
surprised at how good he did in the
batch<00:02:34.290> versus<00:02:34.650> Randy<00:02:34.830> Orton<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.150> said

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
batch versus Randy Orton and like I said

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.690 
batch versus Randy Orton and like I said
I<00:02:36.360> knew<00:02:36.570> Randy<00:02:36.720> organs<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> win<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.890> he<00:02:37.920> did

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
I knew Randy organs go to win and he did

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
I knew Randy organs go to win and he did
end<00:02:38.880> up<00:02:39.000> winning<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.680> obviously<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:41.040> that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
end up winning I obviously think that

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.090 
end up winning I obviously think that
you<00:02:41.790> know<00:02:41.970> Goldust<00:02:42.959> should<00:02:42.989> come<00:02:43.230> back<00:02:43.410> head<00:02:43.800> I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
you know Goldust should come back head I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.890 
you know Goldust should come back head I
would<00:02:44.280> say<00:02:44.580> he<00:02:44.730> could<00:02:44.850> be<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.330> heavyweight

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
would say he could be a heavyweight

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.780 
would say he could be a heavyweight
champion<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.680> not<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> gimmicky<00:02:47.580> has

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
champion with not what the gimmicky has

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.160 
champion with not what the gimmicky has
but<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.360> could<00:02:48.480> possibly<00:02:48.600> return

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but you know you could possibly return

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.800 
but you know you could possibly return
it<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.220> Intercontinental<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.150> United<00:02:51.630> States

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it the Intercontinental or United States

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.979 
it the Intercontinental or United States
Champion<00:02:52.260> again<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.970> noticed<00:02:54.630> something

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
Champion again and I noticed something

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.690 
Champion again and I noticed something
else<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.590> Randy<00:02:56.190> Orton<00:02:56.459> has<00:02:56.550> been

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
else is that Randy Orton has been

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
else is that Randy Orton has been
winning<00:02:57.030> cleanly<00:02:57.570> for<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> past<00:02:58.739> week<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.220> two

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
winning cleanly for the past week or two

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.190 
winning cleanly for the past week or two
and<00:02:59.549> that's<00:02:59.760> very<00:03:00.180> surprising<00:03:00.390> for<00:03:00.930> he'll

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and that's very surprising for he'll

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.430 
and that's very surprising for he'll
