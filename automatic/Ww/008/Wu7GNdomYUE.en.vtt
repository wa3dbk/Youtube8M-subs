00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.179
 there we put on the raspberry jam 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.160
 then the raspberry costs it anyway 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.540
 a little expensive was the raspberries 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.009
 garden or not the guards as and when 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.260
 measure we leave the whores spreads 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.960
 of fate will accustom me jam so we have 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.850
 raspberries here it's raspberries 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 the most mature as caen but we are 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.269
 sugar a raspberry weight and a buddy 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.720
 sure they had a sugar weight on 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.599
 will put the juice of half a lemon 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.270
 so we're going to mix and get 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 made a pathos not have this nice by cons 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.579
 we want to eat like that and so 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.379
 there we will cover 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.920
 we go the seeds erred for 12 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.469
 hours at room temperature 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 we let the judge mourn this subject 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 well integrated so there now we're going 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.379
 to cook we will take him to fat 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.980
 boiling one sees the leather between 10 and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.750
 15 minutes 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 So from the evolution October 15 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 minutes is very very very fast 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 what is it for what to keep the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.980
 flavor of raspberries and there we will eat 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.980
 a raspberry is not sugar 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.690
 is that the taste has 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.430
 trouble getting hooked to the rest 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.640
 spoon that's how it's right to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 side there it is a little bit of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.570
 cum not withdraw it for it to be 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.119
 very clear in cumulations especially you 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.369
 keep her white heritage precious inheritance 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.090
 we will put your raspberry jam 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 departure directly filled 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.880
 really really brim covers 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.100
 it comes back we'll clean right now 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.270
 the pot is easier than the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.420
 next day when everything is glued well 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.430
 cold we turn the pot and that's where 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 will intervene the pasteurization he will get 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.850
 make a void of being the steam your 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.200
 all pasteurized thanks to that you're going 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.390
 to be able to keep your jams take 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.580
 several months or even years 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.000
 least three years it's good to listen to 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.000
 raspberry
