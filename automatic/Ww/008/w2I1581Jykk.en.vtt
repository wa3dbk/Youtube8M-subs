that culinary course and so it was and
it<00:06:36.389> was<00:06:36.479> really<00:06:36.689> scary<00:06:36.839> because<00:06:37.169> that<00:06:37.319> that

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
it was really scary because that that

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.240 
it was really scary because that that
blade<00:06:38.129> is<00:06:38.339> spinning

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250
