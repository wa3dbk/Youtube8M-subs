00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.030
 very much requested here on the channel that is 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.019
 for you to my cell phone 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 a lot of people asked to see us 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.020
 photo applications music glasses more 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 I already advance to you that I do not have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 nothing very special on the phone, I do not 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 I have a lot of apps I do not have a game 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 There's a photo thing you're going to see. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.570
 but as you will feel much I will 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.750
 looking for me was also coming up but it's the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 Six jig 16 and with a golden 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.149
 white has the option of the dish well 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.489
 I chose here that I golden you want 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.739
 view and still on mobile 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 the amount cinderela and it was in a caco 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.570
 No beautiful, wonderful skin. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.000
 base that it is even to see that how much as 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
 You know the iphone 6 has the option of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.430
 release the cell only by the finger then 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 You register your soul and purpose and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.719
 it already frees or has the option of the password 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.910
 it is at your discretion but I think it is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 digital is much more practical is do not 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 many super-legal applications in my 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.200
 phone but I'll show you and tank 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 for the moment on the first page I have 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.150
 the basic applications that come 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 phone and the second I separated 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.750
 some tablets to stay longer 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.119
 organized but like I told you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.310
 do not have anything much fun is the cloth 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.130
 background of this photo with rafa that I think 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 Beautiful, I love talking down here. 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.310
 I leave the applications that I use the most 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 which are neither the phone nor the phone and mail 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.290
 instagram and the tap on my instinct is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 For those who do not follow me, it's going to be a lie. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.180
 color is mystery wega pierre moretti well 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 easy to find is that it has photo message 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.189
 watch these basic little things that already 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.159
 Comes the same cell phone I think nothing much. 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.380
 cool to show on the second page that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.470
 the apps that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.570
 More uses left out and jet twitter 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.670
 youtube facebook I'm always done 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 leaving out the folders but only 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.350
 you have to put the little stick starting with the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.280
 youtube is one of the applications that I most 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.110
 I'm addicted and use 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 what you have the option to see your 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.800
 channel has the option of viewing your subscriptions 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.900
 recommended the next to facebook that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.090
 This is facebook, but it also has 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.940
 the google maps fan page that I use 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.380
 a lot of it is there, I know, I think it's good 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.000
 and I think it works better than 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.670
 laser that in the united states this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.560
 Fun little I have the pinto this 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.000
 I can play this business, it's my chick. 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.730
 if anyone wants to follow me 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.160
 only has this same panel but I think 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.230
 have to assemble panels containing little 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.900
 that I like and I'm putting here the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.510

 then netflix has the countdown that is 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.660

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.989

 because the image is always scrambled or 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.170
