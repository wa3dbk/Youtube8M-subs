00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello here thierry farmers 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.790
 of today so here listen there I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.690
 shows you that I just had a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 flying saucer that just arrived 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.790
 in my parcel end of march and onions 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.790
 organic 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.910
 and all right, it's bullshit 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.730
 is a device called a 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.369
 weeding or a ricochet moimbed twitter 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.279
 in English and that allows to install it 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.180
 six people to weed by hand 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.699
 so it's true it's not a 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.170
 common device I show you a little 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.949
 little so we will install six people 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.300
 at level 2 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.350
 seats and therefore weeding 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 ciron at once 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.440
 so here we are in his onions we have 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.840
 moat makes it so we weed a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 cottage lots are coming back first of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.140
 do a better job and then at 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.300
 level of the device it is moved 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.850
 by a system of electric motors and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 reserve batteries that are 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 powered by the solar panels that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.329
 is located above and so this is a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.710
 autonomous system who is who and who to 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.330
 these practices then high level for 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 hoist very bearable at the level 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.280
 hardness not it avoids to bear 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.450
 lower down or dress up the back which 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 is still a bit difficult 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 when we came from weeding and then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.190
 the six people are one next to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.320
 the other and advance or even eight 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.149
 movements when there are rounds 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.800
 I was going to say more than one side or 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.179
 the other is good it can be annoying 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.869
 high level a thesis advancement but 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.690
 good in the average 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.909
 in practice that's fine then the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.550
 speed of advancement 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.770
 we are on the order of 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.920
 we can go between 50 and 500 m eur 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.530
 according to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.990
 according to andrew cdc it's dirty that's not it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.930
 So bah right there in the grasslands of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.280
 onions in this case his need 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 for the first pass 160 hours of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 Weeding for 80 I imagine a little 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.430
 it's still pretty important 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.039
 says good here is bio more expensive but 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.570
 good that foam understanding here is so a 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.520
 very low cost I was happy with you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.189
 show this little tool that is well 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 practice and I hope you have some 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.860
 you a little bit more about agriculture 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.830
 of today and then I tell you to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.819

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.130
