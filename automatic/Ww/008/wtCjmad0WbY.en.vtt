00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
multi color printing is actually really

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.129 
multi color printing is actually really
simple<00:00:07.650> in<00:00:08.100> this<00:00:09.030> video<00:00:09.270> I<00:00:09.480> will<00:00:09.600> go<00:00:09.900> through

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
simple in this video I will go through

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
simple in this video I will go through
the<00:00:10.290> steps<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:11.520> make<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.969> an<00:00:12.240> easy<00:00:12.510> project

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the steps to make this an easy project

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.190 
the steps to make this an easy project
for<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.469> first<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:15.030> need<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> real<00:00:15.570> good<00:00:15.870> set

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
for you first you need a real good set

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.170 
for you first you need a real good set
of<00:00:16.230> positives<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> i'm<00:00:17.790> going<00:00:17.939> to<00:00:18.000> show<00:00:18.150> you

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
of positives and i'm going to show you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.409 
of positives and i'm going to show you
these<00:00:18.360> positives<00:00:19.140> close-up<00:00:20.239> positives<00:00:21.239> can

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
these positives close-up positives can

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.229 
these positives close-up positives can
be<00:00:21.570> created<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.169> CorelDraw<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.239> Adobe

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:24.239 
be created in CorelDraw or Adobe

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.450 
be created in CorelDraw or Adobe
Illustrator<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.140> those<00:00:25.439> two<00:00:25.710> competing

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
Illustrator and those two competing

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
Illustrator and those two competing
companies<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.329> very<00:00:27.599> similar<00:00:27.899> programs

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
companies have very similar programs

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
companies have very similar programs
they<00:00:28.829> even<00:00:29.040> use<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.460> same<00:00:29.669> icons<00:00:30.180> in<00:00:30.480> many

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
they even use the same icons in many

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
they even use the same icons in many
cases<00:00:31.200> or<00:00:32.870> Adobe<00:00:33.870> Photoshop<00:00:34.620> which<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.430> a

Adobe Illustrator in Corel are what they
call<00:00:42.030> vector<00:00:42.420> based<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.560> solid

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
call vector based that is you have solid

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.280 
call vector based that is you have solid
colors<00:00:44.790> like<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.150> American<00:00:45.570> flag<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
colors like the American flag is the

solid red stripe and a white straight

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.900 
solid red stripe and a white straight
those<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.380> vector<00:00:49.770> based<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> corel

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
those are vector based that's the corel

those are vector based that's the corel
draw<00:00:51.150> type<00:00:51.600> print<00:00:52.380> if<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:52.650> doing<00:00:52.890> texts

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
draw type print if you're doing texts

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.340 
draw type print if you're doing texts
say<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.790> name<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.240> something<00:00:54.600> across<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.960> shirt

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
say the name of something across a shirt

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
say the name of something across a shirt
that<00:00:55.950> would<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.220> a<00:00:56.250> CorelDraw<00:00:56.970> type<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.510> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that would be a CorelDraw type thing on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.600 
that would be a CorelDraw type thing on
the<00:00:58.079> other<00:00:58.170> hand<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> image<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.100> shaded

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
the other hand if the image was shaded

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.569 
the other hand if the image was shaded
and<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> dots<00:01:00.739> large<00:01:01.739> dots<00:01:02.130> being<00:01:02.460> a

and it's in dots large dots being a
darker<00:01:03.000> color<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.450> small<00:01:03.840> same<00:01:04.140> color<00:01:04.799> but

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
darker color or small same color but

darker color or small same color but
smaller<00:01:05.519> dots<00:01:05.850> being<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> lighter<00:01:06.540> color<00:01:06.770> then

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
smaller dots being a lighter color then

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.090 
smaller dots being a lighter color then
that<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.430> probably<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.420> done<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:09.870> photoshop

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
that would probably be done in photoshop

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
that would probably be done in photoshop
although<00:01:11.360> CorelDraw<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.600> somewhat<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.020> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
although CorelDraw has somewhat of that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
although CorelDraw has somewhat of that
capability<00:01:14.090> however<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.630> four<00:01:15.840> color

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
capability however for four color

event<00:01:22.860> let's<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.870> positives

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
event let's go look now at the positives

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.620 
event let's go look now at the positives
because<00:01:26.190> that's<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.090> good<00:01:27.390> starting<00:01:27.780> point

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
because that's a good starting point

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.600 
because that's a good starting point
here<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.870> four<00:01:31.409> positives<00:01:32.100> taped<00:01:32.369> together

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
here are four positives taped together

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.480 
here are four positives taped together
using<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> registration<00:01:34.500> marks<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.430> are

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
using the registration marks that are

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.270 
using the registration marks that are
produced<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> computer<00:01:36.900> program<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
produced in the computer program now the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
produced in the computer program now the
computer<00:01:38.729> programs<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.080> really<00:01:40.409> have

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
computer programs do not really have

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
computer programs do not really have
good<00:01:40.830> registration<00:01:41.580> marks<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.420> best

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
good registration marks so the best

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
good registration marks so the best
thing<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.049> create<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.619> own<00:01:43.710> registration

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
thing is to create your own registration

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.000 
thing is to create your own registration
marks<00:01:44.970> save<00:01:45.690> them<00:01:45.900> in<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> program<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.710> then

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
marks save them in the program and then

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.149 
marks save them in the program and then
apply<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.760> artwork<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.159> these

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
apply them to your artwork and these

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
apply them to your artwork and these
registration<00:01:50.970> marks<00:01:51.270> allow<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.930> these

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
registration marks allow you get these

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.560 
registration marks allow you get these
pauses<00:01:52.680> back<00:01:53.159> together<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
pauses back together you can see as I

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.960 
pauses back together you can see as I
peel<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:55.020> off<00:01:55.229> each<00:01:56.220> one<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
peel them off each one has the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.440 
peel them off each one has the
registration<00:01:57.659> marks<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:59.220> tape<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.180> four

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
registration marks so we tape the four

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410 
registration marks so we tape the four
together<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.320> way<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:02.400> have<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> spacing

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
together that way we have the spacing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.570 
together that way we have the spacing
for<00:02:03.900> one<00:02:04.110> side<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.650> other<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
for one side to the other when we go to

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.070 
for one side to the other when we go to
put<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> screen<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:09.179> positives

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
put this in the screen the positives

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.830 
put this in the screen the positives
have<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.409> been<00:02:10.679> taped<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.999> the<00:02:12.239> screen

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
have now been taped to the screen

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470 
have now been taped to the screen
registration<00:02:13.620> guide<00:02:13.909> we<00:02:14.909> have<00:02:15.029> a<00:02:15.060> separate

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
registration guide we have a separate

screen<00:02:17.150> registration<00:02:17.900> guide<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.860> will<00:02:19.040> take

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
screen registration guide this will take

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.350 
screen registration guide this will take
about<00:02:19.370> 10<00:02:19.760> minutes<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:21.230> free<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.940> just

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
but the screen registration guide does

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.430 
but the screen registration guide does
for<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.970> gets<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.330> image<00:02:29.630> exactly<00:02:30.320> in

screen<00:02:41.600> registration<00:02:42.290> guide<00:02:42.500> now<00:02:43.340> let's<00:02:43.580> look

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
screen registration guide now let's look

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.470 
screen registration guide now let's look
at<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.030> close<00:02:44.450> up<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:46.460> screen<00:02:46.760> registration

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
at this close up the screen registration

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.420 
at this close up the screen registration
guide<00:02:47.720> has<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.290> vertical<00:02:48.910> centerline<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
guide has a vertical centerline and a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.030 
guide has a vertical centerline and a
horizontal<00:02:52.540> center<00:02:53.540> line<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:54.590> watch<00:02:54.830> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
horizontal center line and we watch the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.380 
horizontal center line and we watch the
video<00:02:55.130> on<00:02:55.340> how<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.910> made<00:02:56.120> you'll

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
video on how this is made you'll

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.810 
video on how this is made you'll
understand<00:02:56.870> why<00:02:57.110> those<00:02:57.380> are<00:02:57.410> there<00:02:57.800> but<00:02:58.580> what

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
understand why those are there but what

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760 
understand why those are there but what
it<00:02:58.910> does<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.110> see<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
it does for you you can see that the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.870 
it does for you you can see that the
image<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.160> one<00:03:02.140> two<00:03:03.220> three<00:03:04.220> blocks<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.820> the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
image is one two three blocks to the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.920 
image is one two three blocks to the
left<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.330> center<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.990> one<00:03:06.920> two<00:03:07.280> three<00:03:08.210> to<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
left of center and one two three to the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.990 
left of center and one two three to the
right<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.110> center<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.340> image<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.790> going<00:03:10.940> to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
right of center so the image is going to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.930 
right of center so the image is going to
be<00:03:11.090> perfectly<00:03:11.570> centered<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.290> screen<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
be perfectly centered on the screen and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.670 
be perfectly centered on the screen and
we<00:03:13.940> have<00:03:14.180> lined<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.140> center<00:03:15.440> line

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
we have lined it up on the center line

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.670 
we have lined it up on the center line
right<00:03:16.160> there<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.110> image<00:03:18.350> will<00:03:18.560> be

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
right there so the image will be

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.310 
right there so the image will be
straight<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.700> perfect<00:03:20.330> now<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.870> next<00:03:21.140> thing

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
straight it's perfect now the next thing

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.010 
straight it's perfect now the next thing
is<00:03:21.470> each<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.760> those<00:03:22.910> positives<00:03:23.720> are

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
is each of those positives are

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.040 
is each of those positives are
independently<00:03:24.920> Scotch<00:03:25.790> taped<00:03:26.180> down<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.960> the

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
independently Scotch taped down to the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.680 
independently Scotch taped down to the
screen<00:03:27.320> registration<00:03:28.100> guide<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:29.030> we<00:03:29.420> will<00:03:29.570> be

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
screen registration guide so we will be

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.210 
screen registration guide so we will be
able<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.050> pick<00:03:30.230> them<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.560> one<00:03:31.040> by<00:03:31.070> one<00:03:31.310> and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
able to pick them up one by one and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.620 
able to pick them up one by one and
attach<00:03:34.220> them<00:03:34.490> to<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.640> back<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.150> screen<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
attach them to the back of a screen and

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.480 
attach them to the back of a screen and
the<00:03:35.720> way<00:03:35.810> we're<00:03:36.020> going<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.170> do<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.830> with

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
the way we're going to do that is with

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.230 
the way we're going to do that is with
double-stick<00:03:38.530> scotch<00:03:39.530> tape<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.850> let's<00:03:41.060> go<00:03:41.180> to

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
double-stick scotch tape so let's go to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.610 
double-stick scotch tape so let's go to
that<00:03:41.450> step<00:03:42.100> next<00:03:43.100> we<00:03:43.250> put<00:03:43.490> 1<00:03:44.060> inch<00:03:44.300> strips<00:03:45.290> of

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
that step next we put 1 inch strips of

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.730 
that step next we put 1 inch strips of
double-stick<00:03:46.610> scotch<00:03:47.090> tape<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.720> each<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
double-stick scotch tape in each of the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
double-stick scotch tape in each of the
four<00:03:49.010> corners<00:03:49.520> of<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.790> top<00:03:50.480> positive<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
four corners of the top positive and the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.300 
four corners of the top positive and the
reason<00:03:52.970> we<00:03:53.270> do<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.990> that<00:03:54.560> shortly<00:03:55.040> i'm

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
reason we do this is that shortly i'm

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.170 
reason we do this is that shortly i'm
going<00:03:55.490> to<00:03:55.550> lay<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.420> screen<00:03:57.070> over<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.220> screen

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
going to lay the screen over this screen

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.130 
going to lay the screen over this screen
registration<00:03:59.990> guide<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.590> pick<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.490> top

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
registration guide and pick the top

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.220 
registration guide and pick the top
positive<00:04:03.140> up<00:04:03.350> off<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.220> pile<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.360> course

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
positive up off the pile and course

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
positive up off the pile and course
because<00:04:06.800> of<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.430> double<00:04:07.730> stick<00:04:07.940> scotch<00:04:08.540> tape

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
because of the double stick scotch tape

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.890 
because of the double stick scotch tape
the<00:04:10.250> positive<00:04:10.790> will<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:11.000> exactly<00:04:11.600> in<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the positive will be exactly in the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.840 
the positive will be exactly in the
correct<00:04:12.230> position<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.760> let's<00:04:14.480> do<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:15.850> the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
correct position so let's do that the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.760 
correct position so let's do that the
newman<00:04:17.209> frame<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.690> pushed<00:04:17.989> up<00:04:18.170> against<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
newman frame is pushed up against the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.390 
newman frame is pushed up against the
two<00:04:19.010> bars<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.540> are<00:04:20.570> on<00:04:20.780> two<00:04:21.410> edges<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
two bars that are on two edges of the

because we don't use spray adhesive and
what<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.480> it's<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.810> thin<00:05:35.050> plastic<00:05:35.350> sheet

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890
