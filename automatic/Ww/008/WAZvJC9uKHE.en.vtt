duckies I put this piece of plastic over
the<00:02:29.830> top<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.430> just<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.730> they<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.060> some

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
the top of it just so they have some

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.080 
the top of it just so they have some
shade<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> little<00:02:32.410> protection<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.820> works

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
shade and a little protection it works

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.300 
shade and a little protection it works
absolutely<00:02:34.530> perfect<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> wind<00:02:35.980> doesn't

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
absolutely perfect the wind doesn't

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.520 
absolutely perfect the wind doesn't
really<00:02:36.459> blow<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.850> off<00:02:37.000> or<00:02:37.180> anything<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.959> guess

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
really blow it off or anything I guess

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.770

if<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.800> need<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.160> too<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.910> could<00:02:40.180> tie<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.480> down

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
if you need it too you could tie it down

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.560 
if you need it too you could tie it down
a<00:02:40.840> bit<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.070> haven't<00:02:42.430> had<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.970> because<00:02:43.390> it

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
a bit but I haven't had to because it

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.090 
a bit but I haven't had to because it
doesn't<00:02:43.900> move<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:44.500> stays<00:02:44.709> right<00:02:44.739> there

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
doesn't move it just stays right there

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.040 
doesn't move it just stays right there
and<00:02:45.790> as<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:47.350> can<00:02:47.560> see<00:02:47.860> from<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.370> angle

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
and as you can see from this angle

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.259 
and as you can see from this angle
there's<00:02:50.050> plenty<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.770> room<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.310> there<00:02:51.520> the

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
there's plenty of room in there the

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.449 
there's plenty of room in there the
chickens<00:02:52.720> don't<00:02:52.930> need<00:02:53.200> too<00:02:53.440> much<00:02:53.590> height<00:02:54.010> they

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
chickens don't need too much height they

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.470 
chickens don't need too much height they
need<00:02:54.670> mostly<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:56.250> width<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.120> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
need mostly the width of it so the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.229 
need mostly the width of it so the
triangle<00:02:58.780> makes<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.410> sturdy<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.880> saves

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
triangle makes it sturdy and it saves

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.750 
triangle makes it sturdy and it saves
