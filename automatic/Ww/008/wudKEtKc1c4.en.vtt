no one we're getting along really well I
mean<00:03:03.750> last<00:03:04.140> year<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.890> had<00:03:04.940> kind<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.180> senior

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
mean last year we had kind of senior

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.890 
mean last year we had kind of senior
over<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:07.920> Junior<00:03:08.430> over<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.570> this<00:03:09.660> year

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
over here Junior over here but this year

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.750 
over here Junior over here but this year
were<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> lot<00:03:10.350> robots<00:03:10.950> hotter<00:03:11.190> than<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.580> were

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
were a lot robots hotter than we were

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.400 
were a lot robots hotter than we were

and I think that's gonna be a good thing
for<00:03:13.470> us<00:03:13.650> more<00:03:14.489> team<00:03:14.700> chemistry<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.620> see

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
for us more team chemistry and you see

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.620 
for us more team chemistry and you see
we've<00:03:17.010> been<00:03:17.130> together<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.790> years<00:03:17.820> now<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.420> it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
we've been together for years now and it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.170 
we've been together for years now and it
just<00:03:18.780> feels<00:03:18.989> right
