00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
reasonable amount of competition this

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.570 
reasonable amount of competition this
cuts<00:01:45.580> our<00:01:45.760> list<00:01:46.000> down<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.240> 26<00:01:47.280> another<00:01:48.280> thing

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
cuts our list down to 26 another thing

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.640 
cuts our list down to 26 another thing
we<00:01:48.610> need<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.910> do<00:01:49.240> is<00:01:49.600> look<00:01:49.900> at<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.110> phrased

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
we need to do is look at the phrased

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.070 
we need to do is look at the phrased
broad<00:01:51.190> match<00:01:51.460> ratio<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.150> make<00:01:52.450> sure<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.900> this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
broad match ratio to make sure that this

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.110 
broad match ratio to make sure that this
is<00:01:53.320> actually<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> search<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.400> people<00:01:55.000> are
