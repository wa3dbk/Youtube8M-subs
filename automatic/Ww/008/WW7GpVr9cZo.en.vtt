00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 in the ringer-bundesliga one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 topping the table second 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.899
 Köllerbach had the table leader 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.160
 Mainz to guest was already clear that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 will definitely be a very difficult one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.960
 task also had the Saarland 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.299
 he gave up thomas zwick 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 the polish championships and also 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.390
 other chic could 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 not be present due to injury 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 That's why the defeat was last night 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 maybe not quite surprising 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.099
 the last fight yesterday evening timo 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:43.110
 Baden won such actions 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:46.110
 were far too rare yesterday and such 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.710
 In the end, disappointment remained above 1 11 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 18 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.449
 about a defeat that hurts without 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 dirk and fancier it would be hard 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.280
 that one knew so clearly defeats 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.780
 like the 1 3 from dukurs against atalay 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 came surprisingly 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.990
 actually have a tight one 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.930
 purposefully in 55 freestanding his 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.580
 task fulfilled with 3 0 and as of the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.410
 peter did not get over a 1 1 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.660
 that was two again 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.479
 I have already given away rounds 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.010
 know 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.460
 big open mouth what is going on here 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.920
 in front 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.070
 captain jan fischer also had on peter 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.990
 modos opposed zaidov yet 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 tactically clever , the mainzer left no 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 technical evaluation to only a leaner 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 point for köllerbach too little 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.850
 a lot of noise makes a little 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.760
 sophisticated wrestle thumb chandler 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.260
 vilimsky and iliev altogether simple 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.260
 far too many defeats 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.170
 if we know the 55 that 600 fed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.180
 then we strike mainz today 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.740
 now it is so we have the two 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.480
 Battles lost and my little one 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.000
 instead of a point without 3 and on 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.580
 meat of the camera actually Roman 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.320
 same then are still 2 defeat 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.410
 nobody has still been in the lead 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.410
 there 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.489
 close jan fischer wins three rounds 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.519
 also here no technical evaluation 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.370
 again only one point to fc 18 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.560
 a clear result yesterday 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:30.459
 Should not win in the long term 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.769
 in the in-between to have the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.890
 withstand man break with two 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.670
 four loss points certainly customers and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.349
 fight 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.080
 It is then the decision space two 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.810
 especially from train then also everyday 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.140
 Show on more than 1 0 to 3 against 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.590
 China's willi in general just has more 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.160
 energy and, if possible, equal to 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.160
 beginning
