00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 in this first video of the 101 tablet 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.170
 let's learn how to place the sim 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.460
 card remembers that the next sim card 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.250
 this one if it comes in three sizes then 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.700
 usually comes 3 comes in this this 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.190
 1st 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.230
 there goes first 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.670
 all right 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.050
 in this second second and third size 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.620
 if that means it's state 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.300
 You are driving handle without my Chinese kitchen 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.780
 I know but the afternoon only manages is 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.210
 my my conscience how we place it 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 return to the tablet if we turn around 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.719
 in that part the first one here in the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.600
 top part we place the sim of this 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.160
 way he follows as well as he forgets them so 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.160
 which and so 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.760
 ready we push it he does as a 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.970
 sound and that anchored in the part of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.180
 down what 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.160
 table is indicating is that you can 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.230
 place is a microsd is a memory 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.290
 expansion are not going to start committing 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.530
 this error of getting out this 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 leave it nanothin and only connect it 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 on the bottom yes because it is damaged 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 the tablet afterwards can not be removed and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.130
 without complicating that is the first step to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.950
 set that tablet if you're already second 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.330
 the video we'll talk a little more about 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.600
 characteristics of the equipment but so of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.030
 go do not remember not to vote this that more 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 We will use it later but they 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 do not handle these three sizes remember 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.430
 use it on a pretty surface 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.190
 let's say flat to be able to do the support 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.190
 and place it not at all not in a way 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 it's extremely easy if that would be all 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.070
 thank you 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.070
 dependent on second video
