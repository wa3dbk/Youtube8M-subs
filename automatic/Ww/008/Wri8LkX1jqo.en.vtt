you<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> bowl<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.150> or<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> plate<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you put the bowl on or the plate or the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
you put the bowl on or the plate or the
mixing<00:01:43.619> bowl<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:43.950> whatever<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.909> hit<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> zero

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
mixing bowl or whatever you hit the zero

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
mixing bowl or whatever you hit the zero
and<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.990> sets<00:01:46.200> itself<00:01:46.439> back<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.890> zero<00:01:47.159> with

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and it sets itself back to zero with

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520 
and it sets itself back to zero with
that<00:01:47.700> bowl<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> stuff<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that bowl on there so now the stuff that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
that bowl on there so now the stuff that
you<00:01:49.619> put<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.520> only<00:01:50.790> measuring<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> items

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you put in it's only measuring the items

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.179 
you put in it's only measuring the items
that<00:01:51.810> you're<00:01:52.020> adding<00:01:52.170> into<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> bowl<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that you're adding into the bowl and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.520 
that you're adding into the bowl and
that<00:01:53.880> way<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.360> find<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.079> weight<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that way you can find out the weight of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
that way you can find out the weight of
just<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> stuff<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> bowl<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.000> you're

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
just the stuff in the bowl so if you're

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
just the stuff in the bowl so if you're
making<00:01:57.240> cereal<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:57.899> find<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
making cereal you can find out just the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.219 
making cereal you can find out just the
weight<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> cereal<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> try

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
weight of the cereal and not have to try

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
weight of the cereal and not have to try
to<00:02:01.290> make<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> pile<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> cereal<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.490> top<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.790> your

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to make a pile of cereal on top of your

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.800 
to make a pile of cereal on top of your
scale<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> we'll<00:02:04.469> pull<00:02:04.680> these<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:04.950> again

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
scale so we'll pull these out again

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.010 
scale so we'll pull these out again
we'll<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.350> bowl<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.799> scale

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
we'll put just the bowl on the scale

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.580 
we'll put just the bowl on the scale
we'll<00:02:09.770> hit<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.040> tare<00:02:10.220> button<00:02:10.900> that's<00:02:11.900> ta<00:02:12.230> RT

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
we'll hit the tare button that's ta RT

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.540 
we'll hit the tare button that's ta RT
and<00:02:13.490> it<00:02:13.580> sets<00:02:13.790> back<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.150> zero<00:02:15.070> we<00:02:16.070> put<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.400> our

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and it sets back to zero we put in our

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.860 
and it sets back to zero we put in our
strawberries<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.240> now<00:02:17.300> it's<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.690> tell

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
strawberries and now it's going to tell

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.180 
strawberries and now it's going to tell
us<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.990> weight<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.710> strawberries

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
us the weight of just the strawberries

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.540 
us the weight of just the strawberries
in<00:02:19.340> there<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.740> then<00:02:21.860> we'll<00:02:21.980> try<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.220> over<00:02:22.460> in

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
in there and then we'll try it over in

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:31.080 
in there and then we'll try it over in
the<00:02:22.640> third<00:02:22.820> one<00:02:28.660> put<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.780> on<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.140> eat<00:02:30.320> smart

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
the third one put it on to the eat smart

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.630 
the third one put it on to the eat smart
nutrition<00:02:32.090> scale<00:02:33.100> we'll<00:02:34.100> hit<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> tare

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
nutrition scale we'll hit the tare

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.130 
nutrition scale we'll hit the tare
button<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:36.560> goes<00:02:36.680> back<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.100> zero<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.930> put

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
button it goes back to zero and we put

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.840 
button it goes back to zero and we put
the<00:02:39.230> items<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.800> pretty<00:02:40.010> much<00:02:40.220> any<00:02:40.400> kitchens

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
the items in so pretty much any kitchens

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.310 
the items in so pretty much any kitchens
to<00:02:40.940> Gail<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.330> get<00:02:41.540> should<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.020> tare

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
to Gail that you get should have a tare

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.200 
to Gail that you get should have a tare
function<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.460> can<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.910> sort<00:02:44.090> of

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
function so that you can do this sort of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.700 
function so that you can do this sort of
thing<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.510> measure<00:02:44.720> things<00:02:44.960> inside<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> bowl

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
thing and measure things inside a bowl

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.650 
thing and measure things inside a bowl
or<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.130> pitcher<00:02:46.490> or<00:02:46.730> plate<00:02:47.150> or<00:02:47.300> whatever<00:02:47.570> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
or a pitcher or plate or whatever you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.950 
or a pitcher or plate or whatever you
need<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.870> do<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.230> with<00:02:48.440> them<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.510> those<00:02:50.750> are

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
need to do that with them so those are

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.900 
need to do that with them so those are
what<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.320> basic<00:02:51.590> scale<00:02:52.010> will<00:02:52.190> do<00:02:52.310> which<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.730> what

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
what a basic scale will do which is what

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.250 
what a basic scale will do which is what
the<00:02:53.030> center<00:02:53.420> scale<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.870> here

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the center scale is here

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.010 
the center scale is here
however<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.550> scales<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.270> far<00:02:56.660> left<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
however the scales on the far left and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.170 
however the scales on the far left and
the<00:02:57.110> far<00:02:57.170> right<00:02:57.560> are<00:02:57.770> nutrition<00:02:58.610> scales<00:02:58.910> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the far right are nutrition scales and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.020 
the far right are nutrition scales and
let<00:02:59.480> me<00:02:59.570> show<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.840> how<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.200> works<00:03:00.380> so

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
let me show you how that works so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.310 
let me show you how that works so
nutrition<00:03:02.030> scales<00:03:02.360> generally<00:03:02.930> come<00:03:03.110> with<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
nutrition scales generally come with a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.470 
nutrition scales generally come with a
reference<00:03:03.530> guide<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:05.060> gives<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.420> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
reference guide and this gives you a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.300 
reference guide and this gives you a
code<00:03:05.840> number<00:03:06.080> for<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> variety<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:07.100> different

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
code number for a variety of different

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.670 
code number for a variety of different
kinds<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.850> foods<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.900> an<00:03:09.020> apple<00:03:09.380> will<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.650> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
kinds of foods so an apple will have a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.050 
kinds of foods so an apple will have a
code<00:03:09.920> number<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.400> an<00:03:10.490> orange<00:03:10.730> will<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:11.030> a

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
code number and an orange will have a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.510 
code number and an orange will have a
code<00:03:11.270> number<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.890> what<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.130> do<00:03:13.310> is

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
code number and so on so what you do is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.730 
code number and so on so what you do is
you<00:03:14.120> look<00:03:14.360> up<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.690> code<00:03:14.900> number<00:03:15.200> for<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> type

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
you look up the code number for the type

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.020 
you look up the code number for the type
of<00:03:15.770> food<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.220> you're<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.610> put<00:03:16.790> on<00:03:16.880> it

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
of food that you're going to put on it

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.630 
of food that you're going to put on it
and<00:03:17.240> I'll<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.960> look<00:03:18.770> went<00:03:19.010> up<00:03:19.130> here<00:03:19.400> for

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
and I'll have to look went up here for

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.180 
and I'll have to look went up here for
in<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:19.910> minute<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.500> once<00:03:21.500> you've<00:03:21.650> used<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:22.010> for

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
in a minute and once you've used it for

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.440 
in a minute and once you've used it for
a<00:03:22.220> while<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.400> get<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:22.760> memorize<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.270> code

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
a while you get to memorize the code

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.910 
a while you get to memorize the code
numbers<00:03:23.750> for<00:03:23.960> things<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.260> use<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.440> lot<00:03:24.710> so<00:03:24.860> you

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
numbers for things you use a lot so you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.130 
numbers for things you use a lot so you
don't<00:03:25.100> have<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.340> look<00:03:25.490> them<00:03:25.640> up<00:03:25.730> anymore<00:03:26.140> so

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
don't have to look them up anymore so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.780 
don't have to look them up anymore so
we're<00:03:27.290> looking<00:03:27.530> up<00:03:27.620> strawberries<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.580> we<00:03:28.670> get

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
we're looking up strawberries and we get

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.330 
we're looking up strawberries and we get
the<00:03:28.910> code<00:03:29.060> number<00:03:29.330> for<00:03:29.360> strawberries<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:31.250> we

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
the code number for strawberries and we

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.980 
the code number for strawberries and we
type<00:03:31.580> in<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.820> code<00:03:32.060> number<00:03:32.330> into<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.600> system

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
type in that code number into the system

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.900 
type in that code number into the system
and<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.710> this<00:03:33.920> scale<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.280> happens<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:34.640> show<00:03:34.790> it

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
and in this scale it happens to show it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.060 
and in this scale it happens to show it
in<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.090> top-left<00:03:35.330> corner

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
in the top-left corner

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.590 
in the top-left corner
so<00:03:37.070> then<00:03:37.340> we<00:03:37.460> put<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:37.790> our<00:03:37.910> strawberries<00:03:38.390> and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
so then we put on our strawberries and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.330 
so then we put on our strawberries and
it<00:03:38.690> had<00:03:38.840> already<00:03:38.990> remembered<00:03:39.680> about<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.920> bowl

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
it had already remembered about the bowl

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.520 
it had already remembered about the bowl
because<00:03:40.550> we<00:03:40.730> had<00:03:40.820> teared<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.180> before<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.320> now

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
because we had teared it before so now

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.750 
because we had teared it before so now
that<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.980> knows<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.340> weight<00:03:43.490> of<00:03:43.640> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
that it knows the weight of the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.130 
that it knows the weight of the
strawberries<00:03:44.240> we<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.600> push<00:03:44.780> these<00:03:44.930> other

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
strawberries we can push these other

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.260 
strawberries we can push these other
buttons<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:45.740> see<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.370> calorie<00:03:46.730> value<00:03:47.000> of

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
buttons and see the calorie value of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.600 
buttons and see the calorie value of
those<00:03:47.420> strawberries<00:03:47.960> you<00:03:48.220> could<00:03:49.220> see<00:03:49.430> the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
those strawberries you could see the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.290 
those strawberries you could see the
carb<00:03:50.450> value<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.080> strawberries<00:03:52.180> see<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
carb value of the strawberries see the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.170 
carb value of the strawberries see the
protein<00:03:53.690> value<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.230> strawberries<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
protein value of the strawberries so it

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.460 
protein value of the strawberries so it
can<00:03:56.390> do<00:03:56.480> all<00:03:56.630> sorts<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:56.960> things<00:03:57.080> you<00:03:57.260> can<00:03:57.380> do

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
can do all sorts of things you can do

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.260 
can do all sorts of things you can do
the<00:03:57.590> salt<00:03:57.860> value<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.430> can<00:03:58.580> do<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.760> cholesterol

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
the salt value it can do the cholesterol

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.090 
the salt value it can do the cholesterol
value<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.810> fiber<00:04:00.050> value<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.680> of<00:04:00.770> course<00:04:00.980> the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
value the fiber value and of course the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.310 
value the fiber value and of course the
weight<00:04:01.330> so<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.450> knows<00:04:02.630> all<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.840> these<00:04:03.080> things

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
weight so it knows all of these things

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.900 
weight so it knows all of these things
because<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.800> knows<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:03.980> composition<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.850> a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
because it knows the composition of a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.460 
because it knows the composition of a
strawberry<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.630> since<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.020> knows<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.320> weight

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
strawberry and since it knows the weight

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.430 
strawberry and since it knows the weight
of<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.740> it<00:04:07.370> knows<00:04:07.610> what<00:04:08.000> values<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.080> has<00:04:09.200> for

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
of it it knows what values it has for

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.449 
of it it knows what values it has for
each<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.830> component<00:04:10.400> pieces<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:13.130> let's

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
each of the component pieces so let's

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.630 
each of the component pieces so let's
look<00:04:13.610> up<00:04:13.790> something<00:04:14.150> else

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
look up something else

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.770 
look up something else
that's<00:04:16.640> going<00:04:16.790> to<00:04:16.910> look<00:04:17.000> at<00:04:17.150> mangoes<00:04:17.570> but<00:04:17.750> I

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
that's going to look at mangoes but I

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.240 
that's going to look at mangoes but I
wanted<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.109> mango<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.410> be<00:04:18.590> peeled<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.130> my

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
wanted the mango to be peeled and my

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.160 
wanted the mango to be peeled and my
mango<00:04:19.519> is<00:04:19.640> not<00:04:19.850> peeled<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.810> wanted<00:04:21.079> a

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
mango is not peeled and it wanted a

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.870 
mango is not peeled and it wanted a
lemon<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.680> peeled<00:04:21.950> but<00:04:22.190> my<00:04:22.310> lemon<00:04:22.580> is<00:04:22.700> not

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
lemon to be peeled but my lemon is not

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.700 
lemon to be peeled but my lemon is not
peeled<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.450> you'll<00:04:24.200> go<00:04:24.350> for<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.620> banana

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
peeled so you'll go for the banana

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.770 
peeled so you'll go for the banana
because<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.580> value<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:25.940> here<00:04:26.060> for<00:04:26.270> banana<00:04:26.600> is

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
because the value in here for banana is

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.500 
because the value in here for banana is
a<00:04:26.810> banana<00:04:27.140> with<00:04:27.440> appeal<00:04:28.090> that's<00:04:29.090> one<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.390> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
a banana with appeal that's one of the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.910 
a banana with appeal that's one of the
downsides<00:04:29.690> with<00:04:30.020> these<00:04:30.230> codes<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.800> they

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
downsides with these codes is that they

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.070 
downsides with these codes is that they
have<00:04:31.070> particular<00:04:31.820> combinations<00:04:32.690> they<00:04:32.900> want

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
have particular combinations they want

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.800 
have particular combinations they want
to<00:04:33.169> use<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:33.650> if<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.890> want<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.220> accurate

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
to use so if you want to be accurate

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.390 
to use so if you want to be accurate
then<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.050> use<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.620> combination<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.280> they

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
then you use the combination that they

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.460 
then you use the combination that they
have<00:04:37.580> programmed<00:04:38.030> in<00:04:38.180> there<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:39.169> otherwise

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
have programmed in there and otherwise

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.909 
have programmed in there and otherwise
you're<00:04:39.680> close<00:04:39.919> enough<00:04:41.350> so<00:04:42.350> we<00:04:42.530> type<00:04:42.710> in<00:04:42.800> the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
you're close enough so we type in the

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.850 
you're close enough so we type in the
code<00:04:43.130> for<00:04:43.310> banana<00:04:44.169> we<00:04:45.169> put<00:04:45.350> on<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.590> banana

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
code for banana we put on the banana

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.159 
code for banana we put on the banana
well<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:46.820> reset<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.270> first<00:04:47.570> because<00:04:47.750> we<00:04:47.870> had<00:04:48.020> it

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
well we reset it first because we had it

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.409 
well we reset it first because we had it
tear<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.950> bowl<00:04:49.370> before<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:50.090> now<00:04:50.270> we're

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
tear it to the bowl before so now we're

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.140 
tear it to the bowl before so now we're
starting<00:04:50.780> from<00:04:51.050> zero<00:04:51.430> we<00:04:52.430> put<00:04:52.610> on<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.820> banana

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
starting from zero we put on the banana

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.090 
starting from zero we put on the banana
and<00:04:53.390> once<00:04:53.960> again<00:04:54.200> we<00:04:54.320> can<00:04:54.410> figure<00:04:54.620> out<00:04:54.710> all<00:04:54.980> its

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
and once again we can figure out all its

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.050 
and once again we can figure out all its
protein<00:04:55.550> value<00:04:55.730> figure<00:04:56.660> out<00:04:56.750> its<00:04:56.870> salt<00:04:57.140> value

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
protein value figure out its salt value

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.720 
protein value figure out its salt value
the<00:04:59.060> fat<00:04:59.330> value<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.130> knows<00:05:01.310> all<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.490> these

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
the fat value so it knows all of these

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
the fat value so it knows all of these
different<00:05:02.060> kinds<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.330> values<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.900> carb<00:05:03.110> value

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
different kinds of values the carb value

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.030 
different kinds of values the carb value
so<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:05.870> can<00:05:05.900> easily<00:05:06.140> get<00:05:06.380> our<00:05:06.530> hands<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:06.860> all

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
so we can easily get our hands on all

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.350 
so we can easily get our hands on all
the<00:05:07.070> different<00:05:07.340> data<00:05:07.610> without<00:05:07.790> having<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.240> go

the different data without having to go

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.810 
the different data without having to go
look<00:05:08.540> it<00:05:08.630> up<00:05:08.690> on<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:08.990> web<00:05:09.140> somewhere<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:10.460> note
