00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.690

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.949
 world come to do this tour and 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.960
 there were ten thousand people in the 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.910
 Mexico City conditioned throughout 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.400
 the stage and all this so that 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.160
 could offer the best of their music to 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.630
 others is a very electronic concert 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.400
 with a lot of psychedelia with many things 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.870
 technological very very very visual and for 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.600
 course the people who were there their 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.580
 happy they offered their successes new topics 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.950
 as part of all that is the tour 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.690
 they were very happy they are in 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.720
 Mexico says that I have always been consulted 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.430
 very well and that also for that reason 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.440
 they want to close the tour here in our 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.040
 country they did and it was very very very 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.810
 all right 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.130
 notice that this always happens to me when 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.390
 I had the opportunity to concerts is 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.550
 for the two days of the capital crown 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.409
 all the bands that many had not 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.210
 touched in mexico say the same if the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.750
 Mexican fans that are an audience 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.240
 amazing 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.909
 this is a very faithful audience that is to say 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 an audience that knows music that is low 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.979
 not because we are Mexicans and for giving us 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.720
 onions as you can say then no 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.360
 is an audience that knows about music that 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.490
 he gives a lot to what he likes and that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.799
 They are very faithful to their forts 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.659
 favorite that is why the public for 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.580
 all kinds of artists another can say to 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.560
 times there are all places in one 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.479
 they do not work in mexico they are doing very well and 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.460
 they work well because the public clothes us 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.280
 and protects them even in the middle of the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.220
 acting say the actors that come to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.390
 mexico because it's the great the great 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 platform to succeed at the level 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.590
 international clear because just 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.509
 they are clothed there are many foreigners 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.009
 working here also for the same and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.350
 the management council of the concerts 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.690
 just the same thing happens or is the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.569
 The public protects them 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.459
 is totally delivered then there has been 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.860
 artists that he said is a task 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.450
 large international sell records and 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.119
 all this and the international level is a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.760
 also so much success suspense same country 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.390
 clear then the success of here for others 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.390
 sides then 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.470
 although the band also gives its place 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.510
 to the Mexican public that decides to close 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.130
 an important tour here and that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 I take the opportunity to say that it is for 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.530
 public 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.530
 I talked
